Current legislation already requires pension schemes to disclose both their policy on social, environmental and ethical investments and their policy on how they exercise their voting rights. However, we believe that the non-prescriptive approach to developing policies on the public disclosure of votes is the way forward, in particular the framework on voting disclosure published by the Institutional Shareholders&#146; Committee last summer.</p>

Given that, will my noble friend, whom I thank for the Answer, place extra pressure on pension funds to follow the voluntary codes of conduct to which they signed up, or in default of that will he use the legislation already granted to him by Parliament to oblige them to do so?</p>

We encourage socially responsible investment and engagement. As my noble friend acknowledged, there is legislation covering statement of investment principles, and if that is not complied with it would be a matter for the Pensions Regulator. I think my noble friend would acknowledge that progress has been made. The FairPensions report itself acknowledges that. The Institutional Shareholders&#146; Committee report indicates that since June 2002 there has been a dramatic increase in the number of UK institutional investors reporting votes&#151;53 per cent of UK equities managed by UK institutional investors&#151;but the effectiveness of that will be subject to review next year. And, of course, we have the NAPF review of miners, on which the Government have agreed to consult. There is a whole collection of things going on. The position is improving but there is more to do.</p>

I am very pleased that we have seen a revival of allotments in this country and we are doing all we can to protect that. The noble Baroness is quite right. We have very robust legislation.

Part of the problem is that allotments fall into disrepair and become an easier target. To address that we recently put out help for allotment-holders warning them about this. We have also invested in the allotments regeneration initiative, which is a collection of extremely experienced and passionate people who provide direct help for allotment officers and allotment holders. The noble Lord should be aware that under our planning policy&#151;PPG 17 in particular&#151;there is no provision for building on allotments. We have to audit our open public space, protect it and make sure that if we do build on it, it is surplus to requirements. The law provides that.</p>

That said, the allocation of any land within any built area&#151;I use that term so that I do not fall into the trap of urban areas perhaps not including villages&#151;is always a very difficult local issue.

Having said that, it is important to bear in mind the fact that by no means all allotment loss goes on housing or development. About a third of allotments go for enhanced green space, which is a very good thing.</p>

Allotment officers need to know that if they provide alternatives they have to be of equal quality. London has a particular problem because it is managed slightly differently. When we consider the relative loss of allotments&#151;182,000 since the high point of the war over the period to 1997, and only 10,000 statutory plots lost since 1997&#151;we have stopped the rot. There is a lot of optimism about getting a plot these days.</p>

These schemes create a free-for-all in which motorists, cyclists and pedestrians are expected to share the same space and negotiate priority and right of way by eye contact. Will the Government take steps to halt all further development of such schemes and have existing schemes dismantled until reliable means can be found of ensuring that blind, disabled, elderly and other vulnerable pedestrians can negotiate such areas in safety? If not, what steps will the Government take to ensure that shared space initiatives do not have a deleterious effect on the road safety and independence of disabled and other vulnerable pedestrians?</p>

Choice and competition are important and this is a private sector matter, yet security pressures and just plain common sense indicate that an official or government-led initiative would bring results here. Airport passengers and travellers are already bullied, harassed and overstressed, and they find it hard to get through these difficult circumstances, particularly in large airports such as Heathrow.

Of course passengers want to be able to take more of their close personal possessions on to aircraft, which is why we have relaxed the restriction. Since the announcement was made and implemented in the 22 airports that have been given permission to lift the one-bag rule, things so far appear to be working pretty well. The simple advice that I would give to passengers at different airports is to check with their airlines what restrictions apply and how the airline is intending to operate them.</p>

I understand that some facilities at Heathrow have improved during the past few months. Let us hope that that improvement continues.

When President Reagan promoted the strategic defence initiative in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher, to her great credit, used her personal relationship with him to insist that the SDI programme must remain compatible with existing arms control agreements, including the ABM treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="08011056000096">After the Cold War ended, the programme was scaled back, and scaled back further when the Democrats under Clinton recaptured the White House. But neo-conservatives and other believers in American exceptionalism kept the faith and declared their willingness to tear up arms control treaties to achieve it. This is, after all, an essential part of the project for a new American century: to establish global American hegemony behind a secure missile shield, unconstrained by treaties or by unreliable allies. The Rumsfeld Commission in 1998 encouraged the Republican Congress to push national missile defence forward; and the US Air Force Space Command, for which much of the additional funding was provided, developed proposals for the potential militarisation of outer space in response, which would break another pillar of the arms control regime.</p>

Unlike Fylingdales, which is operated by the RAF, Menwith Hill is under American control. It is a field station of the US National Security Agency. It has been described as the largest electronic monitoring station in the world. Between 1,500 and 2,000 US nationals from various agencies work at the base.

In 1976, when the first 21-year period was up, the Pentagon admitted that it had lost the original exchange of letters. Nevertheless, the MoD granted a further 21-year occupation until 1997.

Some Washington policy makers then were more focused on North Korea; but the United States has, sensibly, shifted towards a multilateral effort to contain North Korea through sanctions and negotiations. Libya used to be on the list; but successful British and American diplomacy has persuaded Libya to dismantle its nuclear programme.

What is extraordinary is that the Labour Party has been so silent on this betrayal by its own Government of traditional internationalist principles. In the American presidential campaign, it has been Rudy Giuliani and John McCain who have made missile defence a major theme in their campaigns. Both of them have made it clear that they see the system as aimed at containing Russia as well as emerging nuclear states, and that they do not care if further development worsens our already difficult relations with Putin&#146;s Russia. But, as my noble friend Lady Williams will argue later, we need Russia as a partner in strengthening the global arms control regime, and in tightening controls over trade in fissile materials and nuclear components.</p>

A change of government in Poland has since thrown this in doubt, with the robustly right-wing Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, bluntly stating,</p>

I, for one, hope that that indeed will be the outcome.

<a name="08011056000113"><b><a name="80110-0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="08011056000398">Lord Giddens:</b> My Lords, since I am the first to respond I am happy to be the first to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, on having initiated this debate on what is manifestly a fundamentally important topic. To begin with, I should say that I have very considerable disquiet about how the Government have approached this issue and its wider implications. Many points can be made about this and I am sure that they will be made by other speakers. I will not discuss whether the thing will work because I find it impossible to conceive that a failsafe anti-missile system could be constructed. You would need a hell of a lot of trust in it to sit underneath it while someone launched a missile at you. I want to raise three points which to some extent overlap with those made by the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="80110-0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="08011056000114">First, I turn to the manner in which the decision was taken by the Government on further involvement with the US missile system. As they say of marriage, it left a lot to be desired. The Defence Select Committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"><a name="08011056000272">&#147;We deplore the manner in which the public debate on this issue has been handled&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000248">That is a strong statement. The Government responded to it by saying, &#147;Oh well, we have had quite a bit of consultation with different interest groups&#148;. But that is not the same as having a proper public debate on the issues, so I agree fairly strongly with what the noble Lord said about that.</p>

<a name="80110-0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="08011056000115">The other countries involved in the missile shield are Poland and the Czech Republic, both of which at least were governed by far-right Administrations. It is quite significant that the new Polish Government have started to make different noises from those of the previous Administration about their involvement. A YouGov survey in this country showed that only 26 per cent of the population thought that our involvement with the missile shield might make either the UK or Europe safer, and the percentages against it in the Czech Republic and Poland are considerably higher, at around 70 per cent. Therefore maybe this should have been a more substantial debate given that, at least in those parts of the European Union affected by the shield and that have agreed to go along with it, the weight of public opinion is against it.</p>

<a name="80110-0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="08011056000116">Secondly, the literature the Government have published on the missile shield seems consistently to downgrade its importance. They speak of an upgrade in our radar protection system. Of course, in a technical sense it is an upgrade because it is in large part a modification of what we already have, but in a wider sense it is very different from that. As the noble Lord also said, the initial introduction of the missile shield was made against the backdrop of one of the most significant shifts in international relations that we have seen for the past 30 to 40 years. Most noble Lords, and I am sure most noble Lords present, will have read President Bush&#146;s address made at West Point in 2001, not long after the attack on New York, where he said that he would define the world primarily in terms of American power, that America would be the dominant state in world society, and that he did not intend to go along with the multilateral

Even before that, the United States had withdrawn from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, so the existence of this project is quite interlocked with&#151;I do not like the word &#147;neoconservativism&#148;, which is a sort of scare term&#151;a fundamental shift in international relations in which, if I understand the position of Prime Minister Brown&#146;s Government, to whom I now belong, there is a return to multilateral negotiations. There is a clear inconsistency here.</p>

<a name="80110-0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="08011056000117">Thirdly, the Government say blandly that they will work on further co-operation with the EU and NATO, but the decision to take part in this endeavour is one fraught with implications for the whole of Europe and beyond. When the Minister in the other place was asked about the effects of this, he said that it would make Britain a safer place. But if it creates a belligerent and hostile Russia on the edge of Europe, in what sense are we in a safer place? We all know that Russia&#146;s response to the missile shield has been consistently hostile. The latest statement, made yesterday by the Russian Foreign Minister, reiterates the position taken previously, so you cannot pretend that this decision does not have very wide geopolitical implications.</p>

<a name="80110-0003.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="08011056000118">I ask the Minister three questions. First, would she accept that the siting of installations here marks a distinct loss of UK sovereignty? I do not mean this question in the same way as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, asked it, because I do not think that the issue here is who controls the base&#151;whether you have an American commander or British control. I take it that this Government will have sovereignty over what goes on inside the base, but will we not lose sovereignty in terms of wider decision-making? If we get involved with an installation, we are involved necessarily in a wide project whose parameters will be sketched by the large-scale powers, not by the UK&#151;by America, Russia and, it is my hope, anyway, the European Union and maybe China. I cannot see that the UK will have a significant impact on something that it has committed itself to. Therefore, it seems a loss of sovereignty in a rather broader and more significant sense than the noble Lord sketched in.</p>

<a name="80110-0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="08011056000119">Secondly, how would the Minister counter the argument that the introduction of a missile shield, or a missile shield project, inevitably brings a strong possibility of further confrontation, and further escalation in the existence of missile systems and hostile arrangements of armaments in the world? Russia has already said that it is producing a missile system with multiple warheads, more sophisticated than those that have existed for some years previously, and which it says will outwit any possible missile shield. How can one prevent further escalation&#151;if you like, a renewed arms race&#151;in which Europe again might be the pawn, caught in the middle, if such an escalation should happen? I think that the Government at least owe us an explanation of why this would not be the outcome of the project in which they are involving us.</p>

<a name="80110-0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="08011056000120">Thirdly and finally, if there is indeed to be a new missile system&#151;and unlike the noble Lord, I am not a fundamentalist; I am not against the idea in principle, under certain conditions&#151;it would manifestly be

Russia, of course, has set out a plan, which the American President has straightforwardly rejected. My final question is: does the Minister see a way in which Russia could be involved, and in which therefore there could be a missile shield that would indeed protect us all, because it would be based on a multilateral set of agreements, rather than the international relations regime that the Bush Government have perpetrated?</p>

I will not repeat the interesting points that he made about how this system evolved, nor will I address the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, save to express some surprise at his great concern over sovereignty in this matter. The issue of sovereignty in the matter of collaboration with the United States over defence has not been a real problem for the great majority of us for a very long while.

For this purpose, I define the start of modern warfare as the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in August 1945. It must also be seen in the context of missile offence, and on this I suppose history goes back a year earlier, to September 1944, when Hitler launched his V2 rockets on London. Indeed, if one is talking about the essence of modern warfare technologically, one sees that the crucial development was that of radar, by Sir Robert Watson-Watt, which took place in Suffolk, near where I live, in 1938 and which arrived just in time to save Britain in the battle against the Luftwaffe.</p>

One of my early schoolboy memories is hearing the Emperor of Japan, translated on the radio, denouncing the use of this &#147;new and most cruel&#148; weapon. Even as a juvenile, I thought it strange for the Japanese to be denouncing cruelty. The attack did of course end the war within days. Had the nuclear weapon not been used then, I believe that it would have been used later, probably between nuclear powers&#151;in other words, it would not have been a one-sided matter&#151;with far more devastating results. The point that I am making is that, once used, the reality of nuclear warfare has meant that it has never been used again. It had to be used to demonstrate the science fact. Otherwise, it would have remained science fiction, which would never have been as effective a deterrent.</p>

So many world leaders, including some leaders of the great powers, are either weak in their home bases, deeply flawed or on their way out. Furthermore, the influence of the great powers has declined. Tragically for the world, the United States seems to have used its military power to diminish its world influence.</p>

The uncompromising threat of fundamentalist Islamicism, which has overtly transferred itself from a religion into a political ideology, is growing. In the Middle East, the price of peace seems to be higher than the cost of conflict, especially given the cash flow from the high oil prices, which contribute to that regional turbulence. Indeed, the price of oil is partly a function of the regional turbulence. In whose interest, therefore, is the regional turbulence?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="08011056000128">The likelihood of nuclear proliferation is growing. It is probably safer to use military technology to counter it, if it happens, than military force to prevent it, because nuclear weapons remain unusable, as they have been since August 1945. I believe that we can be reasonably confident that no state that has even the semblance of a diversity of power will use them. None the less, we must have the best defence against them. For those reasons, I strongly support the principle of ballistic missile defence in Europe.</p>

Many of these issues are not state secrets. The decisions made must and should depend on the feedback from the people in a parliamentary democracy. Secondly, they must ensure that we have the financial resources to meet any commitments. I have said before that the Government have to choose between providing the resources to meet their military commitments and adjusting their military commitments to their resources. At present they are doing neither. Let us be aware that the economic prospects mean that the cash flow from taxation over the coming years will look pretty sick.</p>

Some statements, particularly those from the Russian side, have sounded eerily like echoes of the Cold War. While I do not believe that we are in fact slipping back towards that era, we surely need to learn lessons from some of the mistakes that have been made and to try to remedy some of the damage that has been done. Because this issue has wider implications for the whole future of mutually agreed multilateral measures of arms control and disarmament, we need, I argue, to look wider than the single matter of missile defence. We need to know a lot more than we have hitherto been told about the role that the British Government are playing in these developments and, for that, we look to the Minister replying to this debate. For all these reasons, I warmly welcome the initiative taken by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and the Liberal Democrats in bringing this issue before the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="08011056000134">I should say at the outset that I do not believe that either the United States or its allies can simply afford to ignore the potential future threat from weapons of mass destruction armed missile attacks, launched by one or more of the growing number of countries seeking to acquire such a capability. So I do not favour attempting to place a blanket ban on the development or deployment of any form of anti-missile defence. There I take the same view as, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, and certainly the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. To do so, in my view, not only would be doomed to failure, but could leave the United States and its allies with no better form of deterrence against such attacks than the appalling prospect of massive retaliation. That form of deterrence may have worked in the special circumstances of the

There must be some reasonable doubt about that. Will it work in the medium to long-term future, whose shape we never seem terribly good at predicting? Nor do I consider the Russian response to US policy to be other than disproportionate and excessively aggressive. The idea that a very small number of anti-missile missiles deployed in Poland will pose a serious threat to Russia&#146;s security is not convincing.</p>

<a name="80110-0004.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="08011056000135">The initial approach of the US to the handling of the perceived threat seems to me to have been deeply flawed and to bear all the marks of that unilateralist approach to policy-making that has inflicted such damage on the US&#146;s reputation and its alliance relationships over recent years. Was it really wise not to ensure firm support or at least clear understanding of the reasoning behind the policy in NATO before moving ahead? Was it sensible not to consult Russia at an early stage and at every level before firm decisions were announced, given the fraught negotiations that preceded the setting aside of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002? My answer to both questions is, &#147;Clearly not&#148;.</p>

<a name="80110-0004.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="08011056000136">The need now, surely, is to proceed much more circumspectly and cautiously towards any future decisions, particularly those on the timing and practicalities of any actual deployment of missiles, seeking to meet concerns where they are legitimate and to find ways around problems rather than bulldozing one&#146;s way through them. In all this, the element of timing is surely critical and, in the light of the recent US National Intelligence Estimate on Iran, there may be slightly more of that commodity available than was thought by some a short time ago. After all, a world in which the potential threats from North Korea and Iran have been met by peaceful negotiated responses will be a totally different world from one where the diplomatic approach has definitively failed, and we are not yet at a point where we can say one or the other of those two outcomes is the more likely. It would be good to hear from the Minister whether the Government are urging such a more circumspect and cautious approach on our US allies when it comes to deployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="08011056000137">That brings us to the wider significance of this anti-missile defence issue to arms control and disarmament in general. Developments in this wider field since the turn of the century have almost all been negative. The major shift towards substantive measures of arms control and disarmament that marked the 1980s and 1990s ground to a halt and was then reversed. This was no random event, born simply of neglect or inadvertence. Any reader of <I>Surrender is Not an Option</I>, the recent memoir of the former US ambassador to the UN and Under Secretary for Arms Control, will see there the glee and enthusiasm with which the Bush Administration set about unilaterally dismantling existing agreements such as the ABM Treaty and destroying future ones on biological warfare verification and on a fissile material cut-off treaty, as well as blocking any prospect of bringing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into force. This in my view misguided policy

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="08011056000138">That is what makes 2008 a crucial year for arms control and disarmament, one in which we can either stand aside helplessly as the world slides towards disorder and greater insecurity for all, or one in which we collectively begin to resume the process of multilateral arms control and disarmament and to strengthen the effort against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We should be under no illusion that those two matters are closely connected. If the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference is to avoid being the fiasco that its predecessor was in 2005, if the now certain major expansion of civil nuclear energy in the years ahead is not to lead to major proliferation risks from the increasingly widespread existence of countries controlling the full fuel cycle, and if the cases of Iran and North Korea are to be handled satisfactorily, the existing legitimised nuclear weapon states will need to honour their commitment to move towards nuclear disarmament. That is the view of a number of extremely distinguished US statesmen known more for their realism than for any ideological commitment to disarmament and led by two former Secretaries of State, George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. It surely should be the view, too, of our own Government, but on that I wait to hear the noble Baroness when she winds up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="08011056000139">This year&#146;s election in the US provides an opportunity and is, indeed, a necessary precondition for such a reversal of recent negative trends, as probably is the emergence of Russia from its cycle of parliamentary and presidential elections. But the debate needs to go wider than that and it would surely be wrong if the British Government&#151;one of the legitimised nuclear weapon states&#151;were to regard themselves simply as a spectator in this process. Is it not high time that the Foreign Secretary or the Prime Minister set out fully and publicly the British Government&#146;s thinking on the whole range of issues covered in this debate? What are we ourselves prepared to contribute to the sorely needed renaissance of multilateral arms control and disarmament? What are we doing to bring about a concerted European view on these matters, particularly a view concerted with our fellow European nuclear power, France? What progress is being made at the International Atomic Energy Agency to take decisions and to implement the Government&#146;s proposals for a uranium enrichment bank or drawing rights?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="08011056000140">In conclusion, I return briefly to missile defence. It is surely clear that addressing this matter on its own, in complete isolation from these wider considerations, is not likely either to work or to produce good results. We need to address it in a wider framework of resumed international co-operation over arms control issues. By this I am not suggesting any crude trade-offs or some obscure &#147;grand bargain&#148;. The suggestion is rather that, unless we can bring about a reversal of recent negative trends and a spirit of greater mutual confidence and co-operation, dealing with each individual issue, of which this is one, will be a great deal more

That is a very familiar scenario to anyone who grew up, as I did, under the reality of mutually assured destruction.

It is absolutely right that Parliament should discuss it regularly and keep it under review, and that the Government should keep Parliament informed. I am not going to follow the noble Lord, Lord Judd, into the national parks; I very much doubt that I could keep up with him once we got there.</p>

<a name="80110-0004.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="08011056000161">The essence of successful defence is to identify threats in advance and make proper provision to deter or counter them. There may be no immediate or current threat to Britain or Europe from nuclear or other weapons delivered by missiles from the Middle East area, including Iran, but it would be short-sighted not to foresee a fair probability of such a threat in the future. I do not take much comfort from the recent US national intelligence estimate on Iran. Even if Iran has suspended its nuclear weapons programme as such, it continues to produce the fissile material needed for it, and resumption of work on warheads would be a comparatively easy step. Its work on longer-range missiles certainly continues. If Iran develops such weapons, other regimes in the area will follow suit and we cannot ignore the threat that could arise.</p>

<a name="80110-0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="08011056000162">Ideally, diplomatic pressure and non-proliferation measures would be the best defence against this threat, but they are patently not working in the case of Iran, any more than they did for Pakistan. Equally, no Government want nuclear retaliation to be the only option for defending against a future threat, so a modest second line of defence, in the form of ballistic missile defence, makes a great deal of sense. Of course, BMD cannot stop nuclear weapons hand-delivered by terrorists, but it is the only possible defence against missiles, if not a foolproof one. It is a useful deterrent because it reduces the chance of such missiles reaching their target, and it forces a country which might consider using them to accept that the chances of success are much reduced, while the likelihood of retaliation is just as great. Bear in mind that all countries that have so far acquired nuclear weapons have also acquired the missiles to deliver them. It is a worthwhile investment.</p>

<a name="80110-0004.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="08011056000163">The idea that the sort of ballistic missile defence system currently proposed for Europe presents any sort of threat to Russia&#146;s vast arsenal of nuclear-armed missiles is frankly nonsensical and the Russians know it. It is, no doubt, the political signal of further western intrusion into what was once Warsaw Pact territory that they dislike. Sacrificing ballistic missile defence is not the way to re-establish relations with Russia. Such a cave-in would simply encourage hard-line tactics on their part in the future. The sensible course is the one on which the Americans are embarked&#151;to discuss with the Russians how they can be included in BMD architecture, without conceding them a veto over where defensive missiles should be sited.</p>

<a name="80110-0004.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="08011056000164">Those defensive missiles have to be based where they can be effective. Since current technology means that they cannot catch up with an attacking missile from behind, they have to be in such a missile&#146;s path in order to intercept it. Poland and the Czech Republic fulfil that criterion. Obviously, those countries will want to negotiate with the US about the terms and

They will certainly, sensibly, want reassurance that an incoming American Administration next year will not simply drop the proposal altogether, leaving them to suffer damage to their relations with Russia for no ultimate advantage. That is likely to mean that it will be some time before deployment can take place, which is time for further negotiations with the Iranians and to come to a sensible arrangement with the Russians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="08011056000165">By far the best place to station such interceptors is the United Kingdom. It is a great pity that the Government are not doing more to secure their stationing here. Hosting them would secure the maximum influence over the circumstances in which they are used, while minimising our financial contribution. It is about as close to a free lunch as one gets in international security. Ballistic missile defence will be the strategic system of the 21st century. I suspect that, 10 years or so from now, we shall end up buying our own missile defence system at much greater cost. I understand that the Government originally considered an offer to host the system, but were reluctant to take on simultaneously the political challenges of replacing Trident and hosting a ballistic missile defence system. They made the right decision about the Trident system. I hope it is not too late to revisit the decision on stationing BMD missiles here and come to an arrangement that is beneficial to the defence of Britain and the rest of Europe, and a system that threatens no one: not the Iranians, not the Russians&#151;no one.</p>

He is one of very few people to have done so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="08011056000167">Should we have our own missile defence capability? Should that be within NATO or Europe, or should we simply be an outstation for the US missile defence system? I am simply not qualified to comment on the military aspects of this question. For me, yet again, the loss of Lord Garden, who died last year, is deeply felt in this debate. He not only contributed to debates on this matter, but was very active in getting speakers to inform parliamentarians, of whom I was lucky enough to be one, and encouraged a proper and informed debate among those of us who are interested in these matters. His own view, on record in many places, among them BBC Radio&#146;s &#147;File on Four&#148; was:</p>

A theme runs through the Government&#146;s approach to this. It is a litany of after-the-event announcements, as enunciated by other noble Lords today. The Government say that they cannot talk about it while negotiations are going on, then that they cannot reveal exactly what is being negotiated as it is of course still confidential. Then, when negotiations are finished, they just issue a Written Statement saying what is going to happen.</p>

<a name="80110-0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="08011056000169">My first experience of this was in 2003 when I tabled a Written Question. The reply of the noble Lord, Lord Bach, to Question HL3913 was:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000251">On 15 January 2003, Mr Hoon outlined the Government&#146;s initial reactions to the US request. In 2003, the MoD relented a bit and published a missile defence discussion paper which asked some important questions. Of course, the Government then answered the questions themselves because, in October 2004, they signed an agreement with the US Administration, and merely informed the House through a Written Statement. This prompted the first outrage of the Defence Select Committee:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"><a name="08011056000276">&#147;Despite the Secretary of State's unequivocal statement that he wanted the decision to be informed by public and parliamentary discussion, he has acted in a way that has effectively curtailed such discussions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80110-0005.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="08011056000170">History then repeated itself last year when the Government again made a decision, to give permission to the US Administration to use Menwith Hill. My honourable friend Norman Baker asked what formal agreement and Memorandum of Understanding was produced. The answer was most unsatisfactory because the agreement was simply given in an exchange of classified letters, and no comment at all was made on the Memorandum of Understanding. I could go on, but other noble Lords have spelt it out. A theme of absolute failure to involve Parliament runs through this.</p>

<a name="80110-0005.htm_para5">

</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000252">The Select Committee went on to recommend that there should be full parliamentary debate on these proposals, but it has been left to the Liberal Democrats to bring any debate at all, which we are pleased to do. But the Government really must give the other place the chance to debate this in full. At none of these stages before the fait accompli, therefore, has Parliament been give the chance to debate and, I suggest, vote on so critical and important a principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="08011056000172">My noble friend Lord Wallace suggested that this was an extremely important part of international agreements. I thoroughly agree.

It has been the eyes and ears of the public for what is happening there; it first revealed in 1997 that Menwith Hill was to be designated as the European ground relay station. It has continued to raise this issue ever since. Its members have suffered an awful lot of personal aggravation, and I ask the Minister to look into some of the history of this. They have been arrested but not charged, and charged but the charges have been dropped; they would have welcomed those charges being pursued so that they could have had their day in court. In one case, violence was used against a member, and no satisfactory explanation has ever been given for that. However, it has been incredibly important that people on the ground have been there to see what is happening with planning permissions and some of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Judd.</p>

American interest in developing this form of defence system has been extensive and long-standing. Their perception of the danger faced is severe; the possible threat of attacks from other states through ballistic missiles armed with conventional, nuclear, biological or chemical warheads is considered real. The consequence for international security is grave&#151;if we get this wrong, we are included in those at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="08011056000179">There has been some negative impact on relations with China and Russia as a consequence of the handling of the missile defence system programme. It is important that ways are found to ensure that no permanent damage is done, and that good channels of communication are kept open. Yet the Government have failed to be as open to the House as would be beneficial on the development of a missile defence system in Europe. Parliament has a right to be treated better, and it does the Government no credit that they have not decided to be more open in their communication on the project. I could cite the example of dozens of parliamentary questions which demonstrate the evasive approach that the Government have adopted in communicating with Parliament. This may seem to be a constant critique on the conduct of this Government, and it is a real shame. With that in mind, it is also a shame that this debate is not being held in government time. Will the Minister update us on the discussions that have been held with her counterparts from the United States, and give a commitment to returning to the House in government time for a further debate in due course?</p>

It is a sad reflection on parliamentary accountability that the Opposition have to use their time on debates of this matter of national and international significance, which should in any event be discussed in Parliament, on the back of a serious and meaningful dialogue within the whole country. I am not a defence expert so will not go into the scientific arguments of ballistic missile defence, or the merits of these new hit-to-kill systems. My concern is with why the UK has nailed its colours to yet another American mast, of something that I regret is again sailing in the wrong direction, and what this means for international peace and security.</p>

In fact, I lived in a part of the world, south Asia, where my father actively served in two of three wars in a space of just over 15 years. I witnessed on television the speech by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto at the United Nations, stating that Pakistan&#146;s citizens&#151;of which I was one&#151;would eat grass in order to secure their safety from India. This was in the context of developing nuclear weapons. Oddly enough, he had massive support for this and Pakistan&#146;s development was compromised in order for its military-industrial complex to be able to boast of its ranking as a nuclear power. I subsequently lived in the Middle East and experienced the Israeli invasion of Lebanon first-hand. Conflict, at all levels, has been part of the calculation of international relations in my experience.</p>

The window of opportunity we saw in the early 1990s, when it appeared that the permanent members of the Security Council could work together, has passed. What we have seen since the late 1990s has been a slow, steady decline of multilateralism in all fields, whether you are talking about trade, good governance and democracy, conflict prevention or security. The danger of this decline is evident. Those of us who take an interest in the Middle East have long despaired of Israel&#146;s unilateralism, usually accompanied with silence from the US, and increasingly from the United Kingdom, too&#151;most recently witnessed in the execution of the air war against Lebanon in 2006. In a region which has seen wars in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973, 1982 and 2006&#151;I may have forgotten one or two&#151;the heightened sense of insecurity on all sides calls for powerful nations to be even more careful about nuclear proliferation.</p>

We also understand from press reports that, should the military be driven from power, contingency plans are in place for the US to guarantee surgical strikes against Pakistan's capabilities, to eliminate the threat. The informed view in Pakistan is that these operations will be undertaken by India by proxy, if the US does not move first. The death, destruction and future conflict that either of these scenarios would unleash bears some reflection.</p>

We have seen the US move away from the diplomatic track to one of identification of states that are allies and dangerous rogue states&#151;those that are not allies but must be tolerated and factored into the equation, such as China and Russia. This was set out in the 2001 National Intelligence Council&#146;s report on missile threats in 1999, and formed the background to the current strategy. It was supposedly on this basis that President Bush set out his strategy on the new need for a more ambitious National Missile Defence system, which would address all potential threat scenarios.</p>

We know that diplomacy has been successful in the case of the first two: nuclear weapons have been negotiated away. The third, Iraq, to the extent that it was a threat at all, has been bombed away, which leaves Iran, and we know that the national intelligence estimate of a few weeks ago has cast serious doubt about Iran&#146;s capability&#151;in the near future at least.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="08011056000191">With Iran as the sole so-called rogue state which might at some future point be able to target other Middle Eastern states, one cannot see the case for a US defence system to be based on the European mainland, in Poland, the Czech Republic or the UK, as current scenario planning envisages. That leads one to suspect, as Russia does, that the National Missile Defence system is of broader strategic value with other aims than those publicly stated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="08011056000192">The stoking-up of fear of Iran has other consequences too, where other countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Egypt&#151;the former with historical antagonism towards Iran&#151;calculate that unilateralism pays. They calculate that sanctions against US allies that indulge in proliferation will go unpunished, as we have seen in the cases of Israel, India and Pakistan. Hence those two states may well assume that the United States, in proceeding with missile defence, is prepared to sanction the development of nuclear weapons in their case too. Several nuclear armed states in the Middle East will not further the cause of peace and security in the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="08011056000193">I turn to our Government&#146;s enthusiasm for this project. As many noble Lords have pointed out, we are told that the missile shield is meant to offer wider protection across Europe. That assumption disregards the slightly more immediate and realistic scenario: that if WMD are to be used, they will be used by non-state actors through international terrorism. The shield will not protect against that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="08011056000194">Apart from the evident loss of sovereignty and the danger of increased nuclear proliferation, there is a further symbolic aspect: our role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. We are still seen&#151;less so after the Iraq war&#151;as a moderating and balancing power which, due to its historic connections in most parts of the world, can sometimes play a restraining hand. What appears to be our uncritical engagement with this project will diminish that role. That will have a cost beyond the tenure of this Government to the security of future generations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="08011056000195">I conclude with some thoughts from the <I>Guardian</I> leader of 24 February 2007. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"><a name="08011056000279">&#147;The idea that Britain should offer to house the new anti-ballistic missiles which the United States wants to base in Europe is on the far side of folly ... if you are thinking of a legacy to the nation, should it be to dig holes in the ground for weapons that will not work and whose successors are also unlikely to work? ... If there were a real threat it would be a different matter, but the proposed European anti-ballistic-missile shield is not a response to a threat but the product of twisted thinking in Washington&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000254">The leader concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"><a name="08011056000280">&#147;Washington is ignoring the reality that if a real threat did arise from the Middle East, it would be best dealt with by cooperative military arrangements between the West and Russia, and possibly China as well, working together to operate a joint missile shield&#148;.</p>

Listening to the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, I am reminded that these debates always take place against the backdrop of whether you are coming from a unilateralist or a multilateralist position. My attitude towards nuclear weapons has gone through the full spectrum, from a totally unilateralist position to one where I recognise that, although I do not like nuclear

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="08011056000198">I listened with interest to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. Although I share some of his analysis, I feel that his description of Menwith Hill as somewhere that totally serves American interests, or hegemonic American interests, causing us to become Airstrip One&#151;I hope that I am not paraphrasing too wildly&#151;was a little over the top. I was reading the Statement on Menwith Hill. We may not all like it, but I thought that it would be useful to quote from it. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"><a name="08011056000281">&#147;Also, at RAF Menwith Hill, equipment will be installed and operated by the US Government to allow receipt of satellite warnings of potentially hostile missile launches and will pass this warning data to both UK and US authorities. The data will also be fed into the US ballistic missile defence system for use in its response to any missile attack on the US. This will guarantee the UK&#146;s continued access to essential missile attack warning data, as well as enhancing the ability of the US to deal with any attack aimed at that country&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 25/7/07; col. 77WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000255">I do not want to go on, because I am conscious of time. I accept that there may be other uses, which may well be worth a debate, but I thought that it was useful to cite that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="08011056000199">I share the view of my noble friend Lord Giddens. I, too, do not like the use of the term &#147;neocon&#148;, because it introduces into the debate an emotional description that does not take us forward. The attitudes of American Governments are varied and tend to change over time.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="08011056000200">A number of contributors attacked the system on the basis of whether it would work. Of course, the whole concept of nuclear deterrence was that no one wanted these weapons to work in operation but hoped that they would work as a deterrent. Over a period, I would say that those who argued that it would be an effective deterrent were proved right. All of us in this Chamber remember that we came through a period when we had the wonderful acronym MAD, which meant mutually assured destruction. What a dreadful thought. The unilateralists said that the end of the world would occur if we continued on that course; the multilateralists said that the system would not and that it would prove to be an effective deterrent. Your analysis of history depends on your perspective, but I tend to believe that the multilateralists have been proved right over a period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="08011056000201">There are those who have argued that any support for this system has made Russia more belligerent and hostile. I do not think that we can have any debate on the attitude of Russia today without recognising, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, reminded us, that we are in a period when Russia as a nation state is seeking to assert itself on the world stage. It is going through its own electoral cycle, which causes President Putin to make various statements that are, I would say, somewhat over the top but that serve his political purpose. There are those who also allege that this system would mean a loss of UK sovereignty. I do not see that. Like the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, I do not believe that our sovereignty is threatened.

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="08011056000202">I was interested when the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said that going down this road would blight any form of diplomacy&#151;I think that that was the phrase that he used. I have concerns about that issue and I thought that it would be useful to look at the Select Committee report. Paragraph 270 from its 25 November report says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"><a name="08011056000282">&#147;At the G8 Summit ... President Putin appeared to surprise President Bush by suggesting co-operation on BMD via joint US and Russian use of existing radar facility&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000256">It does not seem to have blighted diplomacy there. Paragraph 271 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"><a name="08011056000283">&#147;In October 2007, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defence Secretary Robert Gates went to Moscow for talks with their Russian counterparts&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000257">The talks have not led to a resolution of the problem, but it is wrong to say that this has blighted any form of diplomacy. I do not think that that is the case. Moreover, situations change. Those who characterise or caricature the American approach as being one that is based only on the military analysis seem to me to ignore the approach that has been taken towards North Korea. We see that as progress that has been achieved through diplomacy. We should not take absolute positions or describe the US as having only one strategy. As a number of people have said, if we are talking about electoral cycles, the US position could change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="08011056000203">I share some of the concerns that have been expressed to the Government. I think that the critics who said that there has not been enough transparency and accountability have a point, which it is essential for the Minister to answer in her response. This is going to be a continuing and important debate. In their Statement on 25 July, the Government said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"><a name="08011056000284">&#147;We have no plans to site missile interceptors in the UK but will keep this under review as the threat evolves&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 25/7/07; col. 77WS.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000258">I do not mind them keeping it under review but I would like an assurance that there will be a debate before a decision is taken. That is vital.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="08011056000204">I must declare an interest, which I should have declared at the outset. I am a member of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. If decisions were taken in relation to the siting of missiles et cetera, I would be worried whether that would have an impact on defence expenditure and on our ability to ensure that the Armed Forces are suitably rewarded for their contribution.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="08011056000205">I think that I have covered the key issues that I wanted to raise. Once again, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Wallace. I reiterate the three key points that concern me: the question of transparency and accountability; the ability to debate whether we should participate further on the siting of interception missiles; and the question of financial resources.</p>

The debate has had two specific purposes. The first&#151;and I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Young, said what he did in  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_976"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 976</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the last few minutes&#151;relates to what I can only describe in quite strong language as virtually a contemptuous treatment of Parliament. Over several years now, we have consistently had responses from Ministers to the effect that we are not entitled to comment on anything to do with this bilateral system&#151;and it is a bilateral system, not, as the noble Lord, Lord Young, suggested, a NATO system. I will give two recent examples. On 14 June 2007, Mr Hoon said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"><a name="08011056000285">&#147;President Putin&#146;s offer to include the radar at Qabala in Azerbaijan in the US ballistic missile system is a policy issue for the United States government&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 14/6/07; col. 1215W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000259">It was not an issue for anybody else. In a debate in this House on 22 November, when my noble friend Lord Wallace raised a question on this matter, the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor&#151;I know that we all regret that she is indisposed at the present time and not able to take part in this debate&#151;replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"><a name="08011056000286">&#147;The bilateral discussions between Russia and the United States over co-operation on ballistic missile defence are not for the UK to comment on&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/11/07; col. 924.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011056000260">Yet we find ourselves faced with a proposal for a substantial increase in the facilities at Menwith Hill. We even face the possibility of the United Kingdom becoming the next area for a ballistic missile interceptor system. However, Parliament has been entitled to talk about this hardly at all over the past few years. As my noble friend Lady Falkner said, it is extraordinary that it should have been left to one opposition party to bring this matter to the attention of the House. That is the first point and I think that we should make it very seriously. If Parliament is to be treated as a significant part of the decision-making processes of a democracy, the Government have to be more open, more frank and more informative about this crucial aspect of our defence policy.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="08011056000207">The second, wider issue was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Hannay, and by many others: how do we deal with the extremely disturbing situation that we face in the world at present? Let me refer back, as did the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, in an interesting historical speech, to the fact that the period in which there was the greatest advance in not only controlling the dissemination of arms but in creating far less opportunity for terrorists was immediately after the end of the Cold War.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="08011056000208">Last month, I attended a conference in the United States at which Mr Gorbachev pointed out repeatedly the extraordinary advances that were made at that time: a reduction of some 6,000 nuclear missiles, destroyed between the United States and Russia; a huge advance in securing nuclear materials; and a huge advance in establishing a whole set of safeguards for the whole world with regard to the Cold War legacy of a huge number of nuclear materials and weapons strewn across a vast range of the world. It was in that period immediately after the Cold War that Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other countries completely gave up any ambitions that they might have had for developing a nuclear weapon. At the conference, Mr Gorbachev repeatedly said that there had to be a return to multilateral controls because, without them, it is impossible to see how we can control the dissemination and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is simply an illusion  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_977"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 977</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to suppose that some form of missile defence in eastern Europe or, for that matter, in the United Kingdom can deal with an issue so great as this. It is a tragedy that we have seen a gradual erosion&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said in his eloquent speech, and as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, pointed out&#151;of the whole system of arms control and disarmament that has protected the world for the past 40 years from the possibility of a major nuclear exchange.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="08011056000209">Let me say one more thing about that period. Gradually a large part of the world became committed to looking at some of the dangers of terrorism. It is vital to point out to those who believe, as the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, did, that the proposal called MAD&#151;mutually assured destruction&#151;still holds good that many of the most serious situations involve not state actors but non-state actors. We have to address that problem.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="08011056000210">The noble Lord, Lord Powell of Bayswater, made somewhat light of Russia&#146;s reaction to the attempt to place missile defences in central and eastern Europe. I do not believe that we should treat it so lightly. Russia may be exaggerating; she may be going over the top. But anyone in this House or elsewhere who has studied the history of Russia will know that a consistent theme runs through it: the fear of encirclement, which was mentioned only in the past two weeks by such players as the Russian Foreign Secretary and the Russian Prime Minister. Russia&#146;s reactions may be emotional and not wholly rational, but that does not mean that they are not real and do not need to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="08011056000211">We already know what Russia&#146;s response has been. Just in the past few days, she has withdrawn from the crucial conventional forces in Europe treaty, which has limited the number of troops and conventional weapons based in Europe to the great advantage of peace in the world. We know that Russia is now talking about the possibility of a nuclear response to the use of missiles or the return of missiles as an anti-missile defence in central and eastern Europe. It is true that General Baluyevsky, head of the central command of the Russia armed forces, may be going over the top in what he says. But when he says that Russian missiles are automatically trained to respond immediately to any missile attack and that there is the possibility therefore of a grave mistake that would lead to nuclear-tipped weapons landing in Europe, we would be very foolish not to take that threat at least fairly seriously.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="08011056000212">As others have said in this debate, on top of that the Russians are now talking about moving towards a more sophisticated system of missiles that would be capable of withstanding anti-missile defences. I do not know whether that is true, but it is a significant question that needs to be addressed and about which Parliament should hear the concerns that many people have.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="08011056000213">In the short run, more disturbingly to me, Russia is showing signs of ceasing to co-operate with the western world, and with the United States in particular, in the very area where its co-operation with the United States has been most successful: the securing of nuclear

Scores of countries will now have access to uranium and other forms of nuclear fuel. We will have to depend on their trustworthiness in deciding that they do not become nuclear powers. The anti-missile defences in no way address this issue, yet the issue is one of the most important to confront us today.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="08011056000214">There are those who believe that one of the reasons why the United States pursued the proposal bilaterally with Poland and the Czech Republic was Donald Rumsfeld&#146;s attempt to divide old and new Europe. Certainly, there was no attempt to discuss the proposal with the rest of the NATO countries of Europe, although there should have been. We now know that Poland and the Czech Republic are beginning to reconsider their position. In Poland, on this very day, the Polish Foreign Minister is meeting his opposite number in the Czech Republic to see what their combined reaction should be to the American proposal. Today, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister is in Warsaw to discuss the implications of the proposal for Polish-Russian relations.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="08011056000215">A few days ago in the Czech Republic, 1,000 people demonstrated against Czech involvement in missile defence. In Poland, there has been a marked swing of opinion, with Mr Sikorski, the Foreign Secretary, specifically saying that, although the missile defence is in the interests of the United States, it is not clear whether it is in the interests of Poland. Changes of government in Poland and the Czech Republic have put this whole project at risk, yet so far the United Kingdom has not been consulted or, as far as I know, informed about the way in which these relationships are going.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="08011056000216">The most important issue in this debate was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, in an impressive speech, and in the eloquent speeches made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others. I believe that the United Kingdom Government, our Foreign Office and our Ministry of Defence are increasingly out of touch with a significant movement in American opinion. The noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Giddens, referred to the proposal&#151;the so-called <I>Wall Street Journal</I> letter of last year&#151;signed by Mr Kissinger, Mr Schultz, Mr Perry and Senator Nunn, calling on a redirection of nuclear weapons disarmament policy gradually towards the destruction of all such weapons.</p>

I have already mentioned the doubts raised on that issue. Congress has decided specifically that it wants to make sure that the missile systems work. My noble friend Lord Addington spoke powerfully on whether or not they do. It is perhaps worth quoting an extremely impressive and, I believe, important editorial in the <I>New York Times</I> on 30 December. It states:</p>

<p><a name="08011056000261">That theme has run through a great deal of the American debate. Does this system work? Has it been presented as working when it has essentially been manipulated to produce a successful result? My noble friend Lord Addington referred to recent tests in which it was known where the missile was coming from and what its route would be; even then, many of the tests failed.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="08011056000218">Perhaps most important are the Russian offers of co-operation made last summer. Russia did not initially respond by marching out of one multilateral agreement after the other. Incidentally, more frightening still, Russia is now threatening to march out of the intermediate nuclear force treaty and even START, which has reduced the arsenals of nuclear missiles held throughout the world by large proportions and which dies out in 2009. Have Her Majesty&#146;s Government embarked on any serious study of the extension of that crucial treaty in order to allow for a new verification system, given that the present one will die in 2009 and it is all that we have?</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="08011056000219">On the American reaction, there has been little debate&#151;almost none, as many have said&#151;in our Parliament. In the United States, during the presidential primaries, the Republican and Democrat candidates have put forward their suggestions and ideas. As my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire pointed out, in the case of the Republicans the discussion has largely been about whether this is directed at Russia or someone else. It is important that two of the leading contenders think that it is directed at Russia, which goes some way towards explaining why Russia is so profoundly worried about the whole development. The Democrat candidates have been discussing to a much greater extent how we can deal with the whole issue of proliferation. They have been attracted to the ideas put forward in that <I>Wall Street Journal</I> letter and, subsequently, in the Congress and by the body to which I belong, the Nuclear Threat Initiative. American opinion is moving towards a new approach to this huge issue.</p>

I would plead that the Government reconsider their attitude towards anti-missile defence in the light of recent developments. I am not saying not that it should not exist; I am arguing that the Government should take much more seriously the possibility of co-operation between Russia, the United States and others in mounting an effective international system of defence.</p>

<a name="80110-0006.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="08011056000221">I will conclude with a quotation from the significant <I>New York Times</I> editorial, which has had deep influence on the primary elections in the United States, about the offer that Putin made last summer of sharing a Russian early warning radar system in Azerbaijan. The Americans dismissed the offer at the time, but the editorial said:</p>

It is crucial that Iran should be reassured that she will not herself be the victim of a nuclear attack; that is a crucial part of the outcome.

I am very aware that it is not an easy task to debate this question. It brings with it some uncomfortable truths. The international community is not a safe place and sadly it has not become safer since the end of the Cold War. With each new horrific terrorist attack, it becomes more grotesquely clear that there are rogue states and organisations that will stop at nothing in the pursuit of territorial, political and, sadly, religious expansionism. The need for this House even to consider such a thing as a missile defence system is its stark manifestation. We on these Benches are in favour of preserving human life and therefore ensuring global peace. Therefore, if the missile system enables this, then we are in support of it.</p>

In July last year when Her Majesty&#146;s Government said that they would take part in the next stage of the proposed US Ballistic Missile Defence initiative, at RAF Menwith Hill, they came close to such circumvention. The decision to upgrade the existing radar technology to allow the US to collect it for its own BMD system was indeed a major decision, but it was announced just before the Recess.</p>

We stand foursquare behind Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s diplomatic friendship with America and of course the special relationship. While the MoD believes that currently there is no significant ballistic missile threat to the UK we cannot and must not ever ignore the increasing number of states that are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction and missile capabilities.</p>

However, like your Lordships, I am aware that one of the system&#146;s most dangerous, important and powerful critics, Russia&#146;s President Putin, does not see this as a defence system at all, but as thinly veiled aggressive American expansionism. He is most concerned by the negotiations for the placement of land interceptor sites in Poland and radar installations in the Czech

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="08011056000226">Any threat to Russia from the defence system is nonsensical. As the noble Lord, Lord Young, said, Russia could one day come into the system. Will the Minister comment on the recent sale by Ofcom of the radio spectrum band used by Fylingdales? Is she confident that a commercial user of the band, having bought it, will not be adversely affected by any subsequent US military installation at Fylingdales? It is lunacy if our effort to safeguard our nation provokes hostility and fear from other nations. I feel Her Majesty&#146;s Government must be committed to showing the world that the missile defence system is not seen as an alternative to diplomacy, not even as a back-up, but as a last resort only.</p>

I am anxious that Her Majesty&#146;s Government should avoid stoking any further the fires of Russia's increasing&#151;and unnecessary&#151;suspicion over US defence measures by seeming to act covertly. Does the Minister agree that we must avoid any situation arising again like that of February 2007 when there was so much media speculation that the Government might have offered to base the third missile interceptor site on UK soil instead of in Poland?</p>

He also most interestingly drew some historical analogies as to how the use of nuclear weapons in 1945 has stopped further use. However, there is always a threat, particularly if a rogue power, if there are such things, or possibly even an organisation, gets hold of a nuclear weapon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="08011056000229">I look forward to hearing and participating in further debates on this contentious issue. With Poland&#146;s new governmental administration it is now far from certain that America will be able to build any interceptor sites at all on Polish land. Dissenting from the previous Government&#146;s policy, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, pointed out, the new foreign minister Radek Sikorski said last weekend, conjuring up memories of our incredibly brave allies from Poland in World War Two:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"><a name="08011056000289">&#147;This is an American, not a Polish project&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08011056000263">I do not know what that means. It does not say that Poland is not going to have it. It simply distances Poland from it and perhaps negotiations will change the situation. Furthermore, I ask whether we can even be certain of America&#146;s commitment to the cause, for in November of this year there will be a new president, who will not necessarily be a patron of the missile defence system. Indeed, how confident is the noble Baroness that an anti-missile shield will ever be completed at all?</p>

I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who for many years has been keeping his experienced eye on this area of policy, for initiating the debate. I reiterate that my noble friend Lady Taylor is sorry that she cannot be present to respond today because of illness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="08011056000233">The Government have never been afraid of debating the issue of ballistic missile defence. Indeed, a Commons debate on this issue took place in early 2003 after the Government received a US request to upgrade the missile tracking radar system at RAF Fylingdales, and after the Ministry of Defence had published a discussion document on missile defence in November 2002. The principles underlying missile defence have not changed in the intervening time. The noble Baronesses, Lady Williams of Crosby, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer and Lady Falkner, my noble friend Lord Judd, the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, and my noble friend Lord Giddens, who said that he is a critic of the Government&#146;s position, have all raised the issue of a lack of opportunity for a proper debate on the issue as they see it. I would say that both Houses have had an opportunity to question Defence Ministers on missile defence, both in writing and orally, and rightly so. As the then Prime Minister said on 28 February last year, if the Government need to re-examine their position on missile defence and take further steps on participation, then we will present those propositions to the House and have the necessary discussions, but we would seek to do this only when there are proposals or propositions to be made. At present, there are none.</p>

<a name="80110-0007.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="08011056000234">It is the prime responsibility of any Government to ensure as far as possible the safety and security of their people, and it is this responsibility that is at the core of government policy. Co-operation with the United States is part of that responsibility, as the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, pointed out, and as we have said on many occasions, the UK Government have no plans independently to acquire ballistic missile defence assets for this country. We were asked by the noble Lords, Lord Luke, Lord Wallace, Lord Marlesford, my noble friend Lord Judd and several other noble Lords whether we have plans to host UK ballistic missile interceptor sites in the UK. I can say that we have no plans to do so. As of today, we do not believe that any state with ballistic missiles currently has the intention to target them against the UK mainland. However, we would be foolish not to keep a vigilant eye on the world and on any changes in the strategic threat.</p>

The pace of that proliferation, as well as the intentions of the states developing those capabilities, is hard to gauge, and that has come through in the debate. Indeed, a NATO feasibility study into missile defence reported in 2006 and recognised a growing threat from long-range missiles that could reach the territory of NATO members. Although work on ballistic missile defence in the NATO context is reaching maturity, no decision has yet been taken by NATO on the acquisition of a ballistic missile defence capability to protect NATO homelands. Rather than alienating our allies, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington, suggested in his forceful and effective contribution, we are working closely with our NATO allies on this.</p>

<a name="80110-0007.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="08011056000236">There have also been claims that the deployment of US missile defence systems in Europe will provoke a new arms race with Russia. In response to this, I would simply point out that the US development of its missile defence system is a response to, and not the cause of, the emerging threat from a number of countries of concern which are developing or seeking to obtain long-range missiles. But Russia has raised a number of concerns about the US plans. Although we do not believe, along with the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that we are slipping back into a Cold War era, we have to take those concerns seriously. Russia has asserted that the missile defence system could be used in an offensive way against it. In response, Russia threatens to target unspecified locations in Europe with nuclear weapons. The deployment of 10 missile defence interceptors is demonstrably irrelevant to a Russian strategic nuclear arsenal still numbering thousands of warheads, as the noble Lord, Lord Powell, has said. Poland, as the proposed site for the interceptor missiles, is a good option for responding to a threat from the Middle East, and not Russia. The Russians are fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of the proposed US system and are aware that their security should not and could not be threatened by it, a point suggested by my noble friend Lord Young.</p>

<a name="80110-0007.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="08011056000237">Russia has linked missile defence with a threatened withdrawal from, and the suspension of, its obligations to legally binding treaties. Russia has also questioned the perceived threat from Iran. The recently published US National Intelligence Estimate, referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, assesses that Iran is likely to have ceased its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 and is unlikely to have restarted it. The US assessment does not change the fundamental problem that we face&#151;Iran is pursuing a uranium-enrichment programme that has, as far as we can see, no civilian application despite the unanimous demand from the UN Security Council and the IAEA that it stop. Instead, the IAEA has said that its knowledge of Iran&#146;s programme is diminishing. We must address this concern and do so now.</p>

The purpose of the relay station was then&#151;and remains&#151;to warn the UK and the US of any missile attack on our countries. What the Government agreed to recently was that the US could use this same satellite data in their missile defence system. The fact that satellite early warning information flows through RAF Menwith Hill has not changed. All that is different is that the US Government are now able to use this early warning information to inform their missile defence systems of possible missile launches from states of concern, and to assist in the interception of these missiles.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a Statement on UK energy policy. &#147;Our strategy, as set out in our Energy White Paper last year, is designed to achieve two objectives: first, to ensure that the UK has secure energy supplies; and, secondly, together with other countries, to tackle the global challenge of climate change.  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_989"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 989</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;The competition for energy resources is increasing. Access to supplies across the world is becoming increasingly politicised. As a result, the cost of energy is rising. Few who have been exposed to the science of climate change now doubt the immediacy of the threat to our planet. As the UK shifts from being a net energy exporter to a net importer, our ability to source a diverse range of secure, competitively priced energy supplies will be one of the most important challenges that we face as a country&#151;affecting our economy, our environment and ultimately our national security. &#147;Our strategy to manage these risks is based on three elements: increasing energy efficiency, helping people and businesses to make a real contribution to solving the challenges we face; using the widest range of cleaner energy sources; and ensuring that the UK is as energy independent of any one supplier, country or technology as possible. Let me touch briefly on each of these. &#147;We have already set out the measures we are taking on energy efficiency. These could result in carbon savings of between 25 million and 42 million tonnes of CO2 by 2020. We will keep these measures under review, going further and faster wherever we can. &#147;We are also planning for the amount of UK electricity supplied from renewable sources to treble by 2015. The Energy Bill, published today, will strengthen the renewables obligation and help speed up the deployment of an even greater share of energy from renewable sources. Offshore wind, wave, and tidal power will all gain from this new approach. &#147;The Government are also committed to funding one of the world&#146;s first commercial-scale demonstrations of carbon capture and storage. CCS is a technology that has the potential to make a critical contribution to tackling climate change. Measures in the Bill will enable this to move this forward. It is vital that, if we are to be as energy independent as possible, we must first continue to press the case for energy market liberalisation in the EU. We must, secondly, look to maximise economic domestic energy production and, finally, ensure that energy companies have the widest range of options open to them when it comes to investment in new, low-carbon power generation.&#147;Over the course of the next two decades we will need to replace a third of the UK&#146;s generating capacity, and by 2050 our electricity will need to be largely low carbon. So, we must be clear about the potential role of nuclear power. In October we concluded a full and extensive consultation across the UK, seeking people&#146;s views on whether new nuclear power should play a continuing role in providing Britain with the energy it needs. Today I am publishing the Government&#146;s response in the form of a White Paper alongside our analysis of the comments we received.&#147;I can confirm today that, having carefully considered the responses, the Government believe that new nuclear power stations should have a role to play in this country&#146;s future energy mix alongside  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_990"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 990</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other low-carbon sources. The view of the Government is that it is in the public interest to allow energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations and that we should therefore take the active steps necessary to facilitate this.&#147;Nuclear power has provided us with safe and secure supplies of electricity for half a century. It is one of the very few proven low-carbon technologies which can provide baseload electricity. Nuclear power currently provides us with around 19 per cent of our electricity.&#147;Nuclear power will help us meet our twin energy challenges: ensuring secure supplies and tackling climate change. First, a continuing role for nuclear power will contribute to the diversity of our energy supplies. Secondly, it will help us meet our emissions reduction targets. Every new nuclear power station will save the same amount of carbon emissions that are generated from around 1 million households. The entire lifecycle emissions of nuclear&#151;that is, from uranium mining through to waste management&#151; are only between 2 per cent and 6 per cent of those from gas for every unit of electricity generated. Thirdly, nuclear power will reduce the costs of meeting our energy goals. Analysis of future gas and carbon price scenarios shows that nuclear is affordable and provides one of the cheapest electricity options available to reduce our carbon emissions. Our energy suppliers recognise this and that&#151;in a world of carbon prices and high fossil fuel prices&#151;nuclear power makes commercial sense.&#147;For those reasons I do not intend to set some sort of artificial cap on the proportion of electricity the UK should be able to generate either from nuclear power or from any other source of low-carbon energy. That would not be consistent with our long-term national interest. Given that nuclear power is a tried and tested, safe and secure form of low-carbon technology, it would be wrong in principle to rule it out now from playing any role in the UK&#146;s energy future.&#147;Not surprisingly, however, some important concerns were expressed during the consultation about nuclear power. These concerns fell into four broad categories: safety and security, waste management, costs, and the impact of nuclear power on investment in alternative low-carbon technologies. &#147;Ensuring the safety and security of new nuclear will remain a top priority. Having reviewed the evidence put forward and the advice of independent regulators, we are confident that we have a robust regulatory framework. The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that our regulatory framework is mature, flexible and transparent, with highly trained and experienced inspectors. But it is right that we should work closely with the regulators to explore ways of enhancing their efficiency in dealing with new nuclear power stations. I am keen to ensure that the UK has the most effective regulatory regime in the world. I believe that it could be a critical differentiator for the UK in securing access to international investment in new nuclear facilities. I have asked Dr Tim Stone to take this work forward  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_991"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 991</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>alongside his continuing work on the financial arrangements regarding new nuclear power stations &#147;During the consultation, many argued that a permanent solution for dealing with existing waste must be developed before new waste is created. Having fully considered the evidence, our conclusion is that geological disposal is both technically possible and the right approach for managing existing and new higher-activity waste. It will be many years before a disposal facility is built. But we are satisfied that interim storage will hold waste from existing and any new power stations safely and securely for as long as is necessary. In addition, before development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, the Government will need to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist or will exist to manage and dispose of the waste they will produce.&#147;The third concern related to cost. It will be for energy companies, not government, to fund, develop and build new nuclear power stations, including meeting the full costs of decommissioning and each operator&#146;s full share of waste management costs. The Bill includes provisions to ensure that. Transparency in the operation of these arrangements will be essential. In order to increase public and industry confidence we will establish a new independent body to advise on the financial arrangements to cover operators&#146; waste and decommissioning costs. The advice of this new body will be made public. &#147;The nuclear White Paper published today sets out a clear timetable for action to enable the building of the first new nuclear power station, which I hope will be completed well before 2020. The Planning Bill will improve the speed and efficiency of the planning system for nationally significant infrastructure, including new nuclear power stations, while giving local people a greater opportunity to have their say. A strategic siting assessment, to be completed by 2009, will help identify the most suitable sites for new build. We expect that applications will focus on areas in the vicinity of existing nuclear facilities. Work is already under way on assessing the safety of the new generation of reactors. Finally, we must work with our EU partners to strengthen the EU Emissions Trading Scheme to give potential investors confidence in a continuing carbon market. We look forward to the Commission&#146;s proposals later this month.&#147;I remain firmly of the view that there should and will be room for all forms of low-carbon power technologies to play a role in helping the UK meet its energy objectives in the future. Nuclear power can be only one aspect of our energy mix. On its own it cannot resolve all of the challenges we face. Meeting these challenges requires the full implementation of our energy and climate change strategy, with nuclear taking its place alongside other low-carbon technologies. &#147;The Energy Bill will ensure that we have a legislative framework enabling all these technologies to make a positive contribution to our future requirements for cleaner, more secure energy. Giving the go-ahead today that new nuclear power should play a role in providing the UK with clean, secure

I therefore invite energy companies to bring forward plans to build and operate new nuclear power stations. Set against the challenges of climate change and security of supply, the evidence in support of new nuclear power stations is compelling. We should positively embrace the opportunity of delivering this important part of our energy policy. I commend the Statement to the House&#148;.

These small steps towards establishing a framework that protects our climate from rising carbon emissions and ensures that this country will not suffer a future energy shortfall are long overdue. If we are to have costly long-term investment, there must be a framework of political stability in which to invest. The private sector should know that any investment in new nuclear power stations on the basis of this policy will be safe under a future Conservative Government. Although I think the noble Lord will agree with me that few in this House anticipate the nightmare of a Liberal Government, I hope we shall hear the same assurance of policy security for investors from the Liberal Benches. They should not take risks with our nation&#146;s energy security.</p>

Can the Minister therefore state confidently that the Government&#146;s policy will now lead to private investment in new nuclear power stations? When does he expect the first nuclear stations to come on stream, and how many existing installations representing what percentage of our energy needs will have been decommissioned by that date?</p>

The Statement is rather unclear on whether companies will be held responsible for all future waste management and disposal, or merely for the current practice of using interim storage until a facility for geological disposal is built. How will the Government protect the taxpayer from becoming responsible for these costs if they are higher than anticipated or if the company should go bankrupt? What price Northern Rock one day being followed by a &#147;Nuclear Rock&#148;? Would the Government intervene in the same way?</p>

<a name="80110-0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="08011060000040">There also appears to be inconsistency between the Government&#146;s statement that nuclear power is a low-carbon source of energy and their continuing insistence that the climate change levy insists that it should deserve a carbon penalty. Can the Minister explain this? Can he also confirm that the Government still have no intention to bolster the EU Emissions Trading Scheme with something more robust?

But I find, yet again, that I am on my own on these Benches regarding scepticism about nuclear power. This attitude is based not on some luddite view of nuclear power but on very real concerns. When it was first introduced we were told that it would be too cheap to meter. The billions of pounds spent on waste management since then leads us to question the claims that nuclear power is the cheap option.</p>

<a name="80110-0008.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="08011060000046">We often ask far too many questions, but I have one specific question which I hope the Minister can answer today. The Statement is not a surprise. We have been waiting for it through the publication of two White Papers. It was heralded in the press not as UK energy policy but the go-ahead for nuclear power stations. Will any subsidy be built into the package for building new nuclear power stations? Will that include setting the carbon cost? That would be a subsidy in itself over the long term&#151;we could be talking about 30 to 50 years. If that were set, and new low-carbon technology was introduced, we would still be paying a rather heavy price for nuclear power.</p>

<a name="80110-0008.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="08011060000047">As everyone has stated, and we recognise, the benefit of nuclear is reduced carbon dioxide emissions. But there is a question mark over the cost, which could cause a problem in the coal and gas industries. We tend to forget in these debates that we rely heavily on coal and gas. As the price of gas goes up, we might well increase the amount of coal we use. Carbon storage and capture will be an expensive technology to develop. If all the money is spent in the nuclear pot it is possible that the Government will take their eye off the ball. I very much hope that carbon storage and capture and the development of clean coal technology is not forgotten.</p>

<a name="80110-0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="08011060000048">The Statement mentioned energy efficiency as a primary goal, which I very much welcome, and the Government&#146;s commitment to renewals. The Statement mentions offshore tidal and wave power, which is very welcome. However, have the Government backed away from fighting the battles for onshore wind energy? It is much cheaper and, in carbon terms, much easier to fix a turbine onshore than out at sea.</p>

<a name="80110-0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="08011060000049">Two other issues arise. One of the issues about which we are particularly concerned is waste. I notice that figures were given for the carbon cost of building a nuclear power station as against gas, but I do not see how they were arrived at. I very much hope that the Minister will put in the Library the document on which they are based because we still do not know what the carbon cost of deep-level storage&#151;which will have to be built and maintained&#151;will be. We are still talking about that being decades into the future. There will be a rather nasty carbon sting in the tail for dealing with waste over many decades.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, asked the valid question whether that included any hidden subsidy. If we work on increasing the price of carbon, that on its own is not a government subsidy but acts to make the nuclear option even more cost-efficient.</p>

We all want a more efficient European Emissions Trading Scheme. It was a British design and drive and it is being bought into, but at nowhere near enough the correct level. It must be bought into and driven forward even more if this nation is to benefit from it. Incidentally, I say as an aside to the noble Baroness that every time I go to Russia I feel proud about the energy equation as regards this nation.

I am very pleased that, before the publication of this White Paper, the difficulties which the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate had with the Treasury were resolved and that a fair number of the new staff will be able to be recruited so that the examination of nuclear reactors will be carried out very rapidly. That is critical to the 2017 target date of which my noble friend spoke. He correctly identified the low emissions from nuclear generation as compared with gas. Could he tell us whether the climate change levy will continue to be imposed on the nuclear industry, given the Government&#146;s now public admission that such a small amount of CO2 comes from the generation of nuclear power, and that this is a burden which the industry should not necessarily have to carry at this time, given the low emissions for which it is responsible?</p>

Does the Minister recall that 28 years ago I announced to the House of Commons a programme of approval of 13 new pressurised water-reactor nuclear power stations, of which only one ever got built, and that was 12 years after my announcement? How will he ensure that the same thing does not happen again and that a slightly better performance occurs? Can he say a little more about what the design that gets the Government&#146;s approval is likely to be, because the key to all this is that it should be a serial system of faster build, with more common systems that are more easily inspected and with safety more guaranteed? What kind of design will the Government choose? Many designs nowadays are very different from the PWRs that I was talking about. How will the Government reach a decision on that, because last time we had a huge battle over which design to go for? We need to know that this time, otherwise nothing will happen.</p>

I recognise that moral and ethical language will deal with matters of balance and risk. The Statement spoke of there being no cap on how much nuclear energy might supply our future energy needs. Do the Government have a working view of the contribution to our future energy supplies that might be supplied by different kinds of provision? Having worked in South Yorkshire, I am very interested in coal. Every interference that one makes in the natural world has losses as well as gains associated with it. Do the Government have a working understanding of how the proportions might work in the future? What is the limit on the nuclear contribution?</p>

Perhaps he could give us a little more confidence that the management of the risk surrounding nuclear waste is under better control in Her Majesty's Government&#146;s thinking and practice.</p>

In March 2008, we will issue a call for the justification applications; that process meets the requirements of EU regulation that new nuclear processes should demonstrate that their benefits outweigh any other possible social, health and ethical detriment. That is taken very seriously by this Government and will be dealt with accordingly. On geological issues, I would like to reassure the right reverend Prelate that I did not use the words, &#147;I think it will be all right&#148;. I do not deal with uncertainty in that way.

However&#151;and I have given the Minister's office notice of this question&#151;is he aware that when Sir John Harman, chairman of the Environment Agency, addressed a nuclear audience shortly before Christmas&#151;the Environment Agency is one of the most significant of the Government&#146;s agencies&#151;he rather startled his audience when he made it clear that the EA will not approve any new nuclear build until the Government have given a long-term commitment to the finance for dealing with nuclear waste? The noble Lord will recognise that that goes way beyond the phrase in the Statement about being satisfied that effective arrangements exist? If the Environment Agency has to be taken seriously, as I think it does, is there not a risk that the timetable for new nuclear build and the timetable for achieving the financial commitment for which it is asking are totally inconsistent?

I have three points on that. There is no point in having a powerful, well recognised, one-of-the-best-ever environment agencies and not expect it to be the custodian of that which it is appointed to look after. Secondly, I think it shared our view. I do not believe that this is inconsistent at all. Basically, it is saying that having a mechanism for the long-term management of radioactive waste is absolutely essential and that it will not allow the private sector to start building or funding that unless it can prove that it has the cash put aside to deal with the waste disposal issue. As we set out in the White Paper, our policy is that before those development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted, we will need to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist or will exist to manage and to dispose of the waste. I know that the noble Lord shares my view of &#147;Come on, get on with it&#148;. It is so important here.

The Statement properly mentions energy efficiency in relation to tackling climate change and everything else. The electricity generating industry itself wastes more energy&#151;which it vents to the atmosphere&#151;than it supplies to its customers. What plans do the Government have to deal with that anomaly?

Recently there appears to have been a good deal of work done on what to do with waste other than bury it. I believed that nuclear waste was exactly that in perpetuity until I met a man in Stoke-on-Trent who bought a large hole and sold its contents of waste three times at a useful profit. Two things seem to have happened. First, scientists have proposed that nuclear waste can be used in future reactors. Indeed, one has gone as far as saying that if the conclusions are correct, Britain could use its nuclear stations throughout this century free of cost in terms of fuel. It is important that the design of the reactors used should fit that bill.</p>

As for the question of a level playing field for the treatment of low-carbon generative capacity from nuclear power and low-carbon generative capacity from wind, tidal, solar or biomass power, I wish people would understood&#151;and I hope Scotland is listening&#151;that even Scotland is not windy 24/7.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="08011060000093">I have been involved in local campaigning and local democracy for about 40 years, which seems a horrific length of time. During that time, the terminology that people use has changed. We now talk about community empowerment and citizen engagement&#151;or, at least, the Government do. Last year, they talked about double devolution, a silly phrase which has gone off to the Foreign Office or somewhere like that. When I started out in local government and local campaigning 40 years ago, most of my colleagues on the council would have referred to it all simply as &#147;a damned nuisance&#148; and seen it as people trying to get involved with things that had nothing to do with them. They should know that these other people were councillors.</p>

<a name="80110-0009.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="08011060000094">However, my first message for the Government is to ask them, please, to start using plain English. Having read the report we are debating today, I had a vision of someone saying to their husband or wife,

We have been quality assured by the national empowerment partnership, and tonight we are embedding our practitioner learning and capturing and sharing it through the national neighbourhood management network&#148;. I hope the idea of all this is not to get people to talk in this way, because they will not. I have a basic principle in life: if people use silly words, they are probably talking a load of nonsense. If the Government want to persuade me that they are not talking nonsense, can they please use decent words? I am not a sceptic about this; I am a huge enthusiast, as I was when the Minister&#146;s political colleagues were very much against it. However, if we are all moving forward and believe that involving residents&#151;which is what I would say&#151;is a good thing and that there ought to be a lot more of it, then let us all work together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="08011060000095">I have been thinking about my credentials for having the gall to stand up and initiate this debate: I was involved in student and youth politics in the 1960s, as no doubt many noble Lords were, because of our generation. I exempt the Ministers on the Government Front Bench, who were probably at primary school at the time from that. There was a feeling in the 1960s that people ought to be a lot more involved and a lot more people got involved. In some cases it meant radical direct action throughout the world; in some cases it meant the growth of amenity groups. In 1970 I had privilege, as chair of the Young Liberals, of moving the community politics motion at the Liberal assembly, committing the Liberal Party to a policy of what we then called&#151;and still call&#151;community politics. It meant bringing together the politics of the street and the politics of the neighbourhood with the politics of elected bodies. This is absolutely crucial to the whole of this debate. If it works properly, what happens in the community and what happens on elected bodies&#151;and now all the local quangos, and so on&#151;have a direct link with each other. This is not always easy but it is very important.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="08011060000096">On Monday evening I was in a slightly different position. I was at a public meeting, attended by around 100 people in the ward I represent on Pendle council, to present two people in the area with the South Valley Masterplan, a regeneration plan for that area. Here was I, who, when I was first elected to the council was with the people, mounting the barricades and assaulting the town hall, now managing public involvement in a very new Labour sort of way. Nevertheless, it was managed consultation that happened very successfully, and always with the understanding that if people do not agree with it, they are willing to say so and campaign against it. We were not storming the town hall, but rather &#147;managing consultation&#148;. In those days, we used to think that there was a real dichotomy between these two approaches, that what some people used to call a patronising attitude to getting people involved was quite different from direct action. That has never been the case. They will always be on a continuum. It is important that when government, of all people, and the state are encouraging people to get involved, they must realise and understand that it cannot all be controlled and managed. Some of it will get very messy.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1004"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 1004</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80110-0010.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="08011060000097">My second message for the Government is that involving people is not always easy or comfortable. Because people will get angry about what is proposed, and feel that the world and the state are against them, they will oppose what is going on. They will still storm the town hall, or whatever other bodies are involved, on occasion. The old attitude was to keep them out&#151;keep them at arm&#146;s length&#151;and it would be okay. The new attitude is to invite them in. But whether you invite them or keep them out, it will not always be comfortable. By all means, we must encourage people to use the available channels and to engage in dialogue; that is the advantage of inviting people in. But there are times when people will get angry, and it will get messy. It is not all working tea parties in the vicarage. It is sometimes a matter of resolving local conflict, which is not always comfortable for people in power at all.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="08011060000098">I remember 1990, when the poll tax came in and I was leader of the council for a couple of years. We had to institute the poll tax. The people wanted us to say that we were not going to send the bills out or take part in this but, as we were running the council, that was an impossible position. People said &#147;okay&#148; in droves; the turnout went up hugely at the election and we were all voted out, and somebody else had to run the poll tax. People have a right to protest and a right to anger. It is not always easy, but you must still do it because it is the right way.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="08011060000099">My third message for the Government is that they should think carefully about what they mean when they use the word &#147;community&#148;. There is a romantic, rosy-eyed notion of community, of tea on the vicarage lawn; I apologise to the right reverend Prelates for these references, but they will know what I mean. At a local level, the community is who lives there; it is everybody. It is not the people who happen to be organised in groups, although they are part of it. It is not national NGOs and their local representatives, although they are part of it. It is everybody and all the organisations. We must always remember this. The Government talks in the local government White Paper of wanting,</p>
<ul><a name="08011060000213">&#147;a voluntary agreement between a local authority and a local community&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011060000204">for local charters. I do not know what they mean by &#147;local community&#148; in that context&#151;as a body that can &#147;voluntarily&#148; enter into an agreement. There is a lot of woolly thinking about it.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="08011060000100">Who gets involved? Well, if there is a major issue, you get hundreds of people involved. We had a big issue where I live about proposals to remove a fire engine last year. A majority in the town signed the petition. Again, in around 1990 or 1991, we were campaigning against the proposals of the then Tory Government to close the local hospital in Colne. It was a huge campaign. We had a public meeting which I chaired, with about 350 to 400 people crammed into the sports hall, where our local MP, John Lee&#151;who is now of course my noble friend Lord Lee of Trafford&#151;came and gave what support he could to the campaign. He did not have much choice, really; he could either stay away or give support. There was huge local anger.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="08011060000101">However, that is not the kind of engagement that the Government are thinking of. That is oppositional; it is campaigning to stop people closing things and doing things, which is what gets people worked up. If you have projects, if you are proposing to spend &#163;5 million in an area&#151;or even &#163;30 million to &#163;40 million over a period in regeneration areas, which is true of some I am involved with&#151;people will get involved; not in huge numbers, but quite a lot will come to exhibitions. A sufficient number will take part in a local group to work with the council, or whatever other authorities, to see it through.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="08011060000102">However, when you get to those who will attend meetings month by month and get involved at that level, particularly if there are no huge projects going on, you really are down to the committed few to keep it going. Are they the community? If so, are they representative? If not, how do you make important decisions about priorities? The Liberal Democrats say that that is where elected councillors come in. You cannot keep them out of the process, because they are elected to mediate between the different demands and views in the community and, ultimately, make choices; not locked away in smoke-filled rooms&#151;as they would not be now&#151;or otherwise, but as part and parcel of community decision-making processes.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="08011060000103">When nothing much is going on, there are people who are dormant but still interested. As a ward councillor, I send out an e-mail newsletter every week or fortnight about everything going on in the ward that I know about&#151;planning applications, items on agendas and so on. Over 100 people now are happy to receive that, and only one person has ever cancelled it. That kind of provision of information to people is good because when something crops up, there are a lot more people who know about it and turn up.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="08011060000104">The Government may want to stimulate a lot of public involvement; they have done one thing recently that will do far more than all this to achieve that; that is, the recent local government finance settlement. This really puts the squeeze on some councils for the first time in some years. There will, for example, be library closures, community centre closures and cuts in local services of all kinds. That will get people going; I am not quite sure that this is the way the Government want to do it.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="08011060000105">I talked about priorities and the importance of councillors, and my noble friends will go into that a bit more.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="08011060000106">When I read the Government&#146;s papers, where are the references to political parties? Which are the bodies that, for all their faults and lack of members nowadays, provide the engine room for activism in the community in so many places? The Government and the people who write all these papers seem to think that political parties can be written out of the equation; they hope that they will go away, leaving nice community involvement and engagement with citizens, without the sort of conflicts, arguments and rows that political parties bring along. I have got news for them: if that is what they think, they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. Political parties, activists and elected representatives are a crucial part of political

They are a crucial part of the way the community works in determining opinions, who turns out to get involved in particular issues&#151;whether it is oppositional or managed&#151;and of course who gets elected to the council.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="08011060000107">My next message for the Government&#151;I think that it is number five, but I have lost count&#151;is that, with regard to involving people or community engagement or whatever it is called, you have got to look at it in all kinds of communities, neighbourhoods and areas. There is a temptation to say that neighbourhood management is a new trendy thing and we will do it in the deprived or disadvantaged areas&#151;what we used to call the poor areas. If you are going to do it, you have to do it everywhere, and this needs resources. The disadvantaged areas are the ones where perhaps there are fewer resources in the community itself, but whether you are talking about add-on projects such as putting in neighbourhood management schemes, or just trying to do things in a more local way in your normal, mainstream services, that still needs extra resources. At a time when the Government are demanding that councils impose 3 per cent annual efficiency cuts, it is very difficult to find those resources. If there is a choice between cutting a service or delivering that service in a different way, most councils will go for not cutting the service&#151;that is just the way it is.</p>

<a name="80110-0010.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="08011060000108">I have used up my time. I wish the Government well. My final message is: do not believe that you can do this top-down; you can&#146;t. Page 29 of the report says,</p>
<ul><a name="08011060000208">&#147;we must increase people&#146;s influence over service provision and local decisions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011060000109">You can&#146;t do that; you can encourage, you can stimulate, you can provide the structures that make it more possible, but when it comes down to it you need people on the ground, politicians and the people who run organisations, who are enthusiastically in favour of it, and who accept&#151;as the Government have to accept&#151;that it will be untidy and messy. The Government can get over that by calling it diversity in practice, but it will still be untidy and messy, and in some places it will not work. Yet where it does work, it is the most fantastic thing in the world. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to the political parties. I joined the Labour Party when I was 16. I attended meetings of other parties. I was the Prime Minister of the Tyneside Youth Parliament for a period. My involvement was all natural: it was there and I participated.

They would not have used a grand word like &#147;participation&#148; or &#147;involvement&#148;, but when they went to their local Co-op store, they knew that it was their Co-op store.

I am told that your Lordships&#146; House is a place of welcome and hospitality, and I have found it so. I come from a rural and a farming background. I am proud to say that my family, despite all the things that have happened in the past few years, are still farming. All my ministry has been spent in small country parishes and I bring that experience to this House. In addition, I have spent 15 years at the National Agricultural Centre and with the Royal Agricultural Society dealing in a sense with the socio-economic issues that underline the report. The diocese I now serve comprises Cambridgeshire and west Norfolk. Ely looks out on some of the most fertile and consequently the most expensive land in England. A third of it is below sea level; part of the diocese is at 25 feet below sea level, so there are issues there that the House could address at some stage.</p>

It said a lot about agriculture, but it was basically a social document and the countries that read it that way&#151;France and Germany particularly&#151;have therefore made great progress in those areas.</p>

In recent years that has been exacerbated by planning policies and social policies based on the concept of city regions, which is an American concept, and central place theory. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, mentions community. &#147;Community&#148; is a central word but it is difficult to define. It can apply equally to the European Community and to a small religious house. A former academic colleague listed 94 definitions of community&#151;that was of undoubted academic interest but not of a great deal of practical help as we looked at the problems of rural areas. In reality, community is known by its absence&#151;we know when it is not present, but it is difficult to define by its presence.</p>

I like the definition of a Fenland parishioner in the area that I now serve. She said that such a settlement has to be large enough for a good deal to be going on and small enough so that she misses none of it. The whole of the eastern region is experiencing extraordinary population growth, the fastest of any part of the country. Cambridgeshire is a region that is growing enormously and many people are responding to the challenges that that throws up.</p>

Whether good or bad local government happens in that area, that is not in a sense the point. The point is the indefinable sense of community in those places, which does not depend on the frequency of rubbish collections or the availability of children&#146;s playgrounds. Once again we can be trapped into believing that what we cannot measure does not exist.</p>

I can tell him that that will come in handy here. His CV lists his non-political career. I have to say that I think that the Church of England manages a fair bit of politics.

Also, more seriously, they have a deep understanding of people&#146;s lives, which can sometimes be missed in the speed of life in London and in Parliament. However much we disparage the ivory tower and say that we get out of it, it can be a problem.

They see it as giving power from central government to a local authority; we understand the formal legislative position, but for us the underlying philosophy is that the power comes from the people within the local authority area as a part of the governance arrangements as well as being its citizens. The language, as I and my noble friend have said, is important.</p>

I am not sure whether the Secretary of State is heading a football or is about to be knocked out by it. I see from the Minister&#146;s face that she thinks that a little more proofreading in its widest sense might not go amiss sometimes. Still on the theme of language, I had thought that the term &#147;citizen&#148; featured nowhere in this paper. However, just before I came to Westminster, I found it in a paragraph about activists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="08011060000135">Whatever the language, it has a hollow ring if it is only words. Local government throughout the country needs to be seen as powerful and local authorities need to be seen as autonomous; if they are not, everything else about empowerment is, at best, on a very insecure base. I am talking about things such as local income tax, ring-fenced grants and so on. Local authorities need to send out the unspoken message that they are open to ideas, to discussion and to involvement. Without this, there is a degree of cynicism that is difficult to overcome. That is not to be taken in any way as opposing the role of the community. I agree with other noble Lords that there is what one might sum up as a question mark over what is meant by community. I particularly liked the notion that one sometimes knows it by its absence. A structure without firm foundations will be very flimsy.</p>

I find that almost unbelievable. So perhaps processes and structures are needed. But I find the whole agenda, as put forward by the Government, too process-driven. The quicker we move from prescribed, discrete procedures to a culture where individuals who are elected&#151;or who, as officers, are appointed&#151;quite naturally involve local people, the better.</p>

In 1983, when my group took over the administration of my local authority, I became chair of the planning committee. We changed the procedures almost overnight to involve those who were affected by planning applications as well as those involved in the whole area of forward planning. I did not at the time recognise how difficult I was making life for the officers by imposing these new ideas on them. Perhaps it is unfair to say &#147;imposing&#148;&#151;they did not resist them.

The chair of the civic forum reminded us that printed communication is on its way to being obsolete and that new media, &#147;used by citizens other than geeks like us&#148;&#151;I quote him&#151;are what one needs to focus on. The website www.theyworkforyou.com facilitates communication, which comes to us as a &#147;letter from your constituent&#148;. I do not know whether this will get me a mention on the website. It has a lot of information and very good links. The e-mails that I get as a Member of the London Assembly, which is London&#146;s strategic government and which has a rather particular role, are almost invariably about things over which the GLA has little influence, let alone direct power. People who are using the facility express their frustration and I feel embarrassed that the answers often have to go back, as nicely and helpfully as possible, saying, &#147;This is not something for us&#148;. The bureaucracy and the demarcations must make citizens&#146; eyes glaze over.

Tony Greaves, as most of us refer to him in our party, was one of the authors of community politics in the 1960s and beyond.

I come from the neighbouring county of Suffolk and I know how difficult it is for rural communities to feel that politicians operating from London really understand their concerns. It seems ironic, incidentally, that a debate on involvement has attracted so few speakers. I found myself asking why this is. I came to the conclusion that the problem is that we are debating a document called <I>The Action Plan for Community Empowerment</I>. I am afraid to say to the Government that the term &#147;action plan&#148; has now become oxymoronic. It usually means that someone has gone away and thought about things and that nothing will be done. Community empowerment is seen by most people as meaningless jargon.</p>

It emphasises what is seen as the divide in thinking between Whitehall and Westminster and the rest of world where we are seen as living in an ivory tower. That is something of a shame because every one of us here is a member of a number of communities. Everyone in the country belongs to a number of communities: where they happen to live, the places where they work, where they worship, or among people who share their interests.</p>

That is where the comments of my noble friend Lord Greaves comments were absolutely right. It is not possible to legislate for that. It is not possible somehow to direct from above or even from a local authority that people must get involved in a particular way. This is something that people will choose to do if they think it is worth while. The question today is how government, central and local, and public bodies should behave and organise themselves in order to encourage the sense of community which already exists and further to encourage the development of community thinking and action where it does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="08011060000150">The right reverend Prelate made a very interesting point when he said that community was often more noticeable in its absence. When I moved to Needham Market in the early 1980s, having spent my life moving around as a forces child and then as a forces wife, I certainly found that the sense of community just hit me because it was something I had never come across before. I found it hugely comforting. Becoming involved in community activities was what led me into politics. So there is a salutary lesson there for anyone. Nevertheless, I think you know community when you see it. It is what makes this sort of debate so difficult. I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Government when they are trying to produce documents such as this, because it is like trying to nail jelly to a wall. I recognise the difficulty but they, in turn, must recognise that there is a danger that in trying to pin too much down, you lose the sense of the very thing you are trying to create.</p>

Much is made of how this country has one of the most flexible job markets in the world. That tends to mean that people move around and are therefore much less rooted. It is much harder to have a sense of community if you think you will be living somewhere for only two or three years and will then move on. The Government will have to think hard about that when it comes to providing new housing. As the right reverend Prelate so rightly said, we can build the houses but we cannot easily build the communities.</p>

A whole industry has developed around the consumerist approach that links service users and their providers, using things such as surveys, feedback and complaint forms. This is relatively recent. There are much better networks now, much better ways in which interest groups organise themselves and have their say. That applies both locally and nationally. When I get a heavy postbag on a particular issue&#151;at the moment it is the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill&#151;I think it is fantastic that people take the time and trouble to put pen to paper or send an e-mail.</p>

A lot of exciting work is going on, and that is very new too. There are also the events that react to specific challenges. My noble friend Lord Greaves and the noble Lord, Lord Graham, talked about how people will come out of the woodwork when something really affects them, such as post office or hospital closures. But the act of voting is still the biggest way in which people are involved in their local community. Despite declining voter turn-out, more people turn out to vote than are involved in other areas. We should never forget that or denigrate the role of local elections.</p>

We on these Benches argue that there is a difficulty when first-past-the-post electoral systems result in fiefdoms, which can result in unresponsive government. The public have reacted by electing far more local authorities which are now in no overall political control, but the Government are making it quite difficult to manage those politically. I do not intend to rerun the debates we had on the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill but there is a danger that the current models imposed on local authorities deny the plurality that the voters have chosen. If they want a council run by a number of political groups, it is the business of Government not to get in the way of the councils running themselves. I genuinely believe that local democracy works best when it is truly local. Evidence from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, among others, has shown that relationships are closer between smaller organisations and communities. The larger organisations become, the harder it is to keep that closeness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="08011060000155">I recognise that there is a difficult balance to be struck as regards obtaining efficiency, economies of scale and capacity for a strategic role. All those tend to gravitate towards larger units, not just for local authorities but for all sorts of other public bodies. Yet we know that the public would rather have a council that is close by, where they feel that they know the people involved, and where they can go to the town hall rather than have a huge modern, PFI-built structure on the edge of town that nobody can get to. Telling them that they can send an e-mail is still not the way to involve many people. We need to do an awful lot more to develop situations that work in particular areas where smaller councils can work together to provide strategic services but still be small enough to keep the local link. At the same time large councils can be helped to develop governance mechanisms that keep them close to the people they represent. The concept that these solutions should be developed locally is key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="08011060000156">As I said, this is not just a local authority problem. I often hear how consolidation in the housing association sector means that housing associations, which are becoming ever larger, are losing much of the local link with the residents that was a key part in the decision to move to a housing association in the first place. It is a great pity if tenants feel that they are losing that involvement.</p>

There is much evidence to show that there is virtually a systemic failure to bring the results of complaints and consultation exercises into decision-making. That has led to real cynicism about local governance. People will not get involved if they think that it will not make any difference. That has been exacerbated by the huge number of local bodies which now operate. Most areas have a real alphabet soup of public bodies providing services, giving grants and performing other functions. All that makes it very difficult for citizens to work their way through the system.</p>

<a name="80110-0011.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="08011060000158">I know that the Government have rather belatedly recognised that and by forming local strategic partnerships are making an attempt to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. However, there are dangers in that. There is a danger of having too much closed door decision-making. There may be more people behind the closed door but it may still be a closed door. Taxpayers&#146; money is involved here. If we are to ensure that people do not become cynical where taxpayers&#146; money is being spent, they need to be able to see what is happening. I have seen two reports recently from local press organisations, which say they believe that under new executive arrangements local councils are much less transparent than they used to be. The press feel that they are not able to do the job they used to do in reporting to the citizens in their areas.</p>

<a name="80110-0011.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="08011060000159">It seems to us that council leadership is absolutely essential because when it comes to the crunch they are the only people who can be booted out. They are the only people who can be held accountable by the local population. There is a major challenge as regards how we ensure that these networks are genuinely open to everyone. We have to accept that many people will choose never to get involved. Rowntree estimates that about 50 per cent of the population in a given area are not involved and do not want to be, and we have to accept that. However, that still leaves a lot of scope for work. As my noble friend Lady Hamwee, said, the methods we use to consult, the location and design of buildings, and whether people are contactable by e-mail are not rocket science but they are very important in terms of whether people feel there is a point in getting involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="08011060000160">But ultimately the key to this is that central government have to deal with the paradox that on the one hand they seek to maintain central control, particularly financial, but at the same time they put duties on local authorities to consult residents and users. If community involvement is to be genuine, local bodies must have genuine autonomy. They need to be free from targets, ring-fenced grants, inspections, public service agreements, capping and the whole centralist paraphernalia. Until they are genuinely autonomous and can respond to the communities, Government face an uphill struggle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="08011060000162">I, too, welcome the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ely. I am a fellow East Anglian, born, bred and raised in East Anglia. As he is from Ely, he may think that Essex is not a part of East Anglia&#151;it is a rather urban type of existence there&#151;but I assure him that I have a great deal in common with him in what he was saying. I thought his comments on the need to develop community in relation to new developments, particularly large-scale ones, were interesting and helpful.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="08011060000163">All of us who have been involved in this for a long time&#151;I cannot begin to approach the depth of experience of the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton&#151;have different perspectives on the subject. Perhaps I might be allowed a couple of reminiscences to show how hot community involvement can be. I well remember an occasion when we were consulting on education reorganisation, which, curiously enough, was required by Harold Wilson&#146;s Government back in the late 1960s. We, a Conservative education authority, proposed to a district in a Labour authority a very Labour form of reorganisation. It was a new town where the population had stopped growing. All of a sudden, the school populations began to drop and something had to be done, but we did not like the idea of closing schools. I shall not bore the House with the detail, but we held a series of meetings in the town. One night, six of us went to chair the meetings and about 400 or 500 people attended each one. That is real community involvement. People felt passionate about the issue, which was exacerbated for political reasons. Another point you need to bear in mind on community involvement is whom you are talking to. In that instance, we were Conservatives and they were socialists, but they would have fought us whatever we proposed. That is the way life is sometimes.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="08011060000164">Another example of real empowerment arose in a different town, where there was a similar series of meetings. The one that I chaired was going extremely well. There were about 600 people in the school sports hall on a bitterly cold night. The meeting could have gone on all night, but after an hour and a half the school caretaker, a very wise man, simply turned off the heating. That is real empowerment. The meeting came to a sensible conclusion and closed at a reasonable hour. That is community involvement.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="08011060000165">We should recognise that this has gone on over a long time. Of course, its nature has changed, but to have community involvement you need an issue. The idea that people will keep coming out to chew the fat over minor changes in their community on a monthly or even a quarterly basis is just unreal. They simply will not. There are too many other distractions in life nowadays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="08011060000166">I am afraid that my view is that community interest has diminished. The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, talked about community leadership and accountability. Not least of the difficulties that we have in dealing with this

It did not matter whether it was a county, district or parish council; their powers were defined. They had an annual budget that was in their absolute control and the result was that, when a particular issue arose, the community knew precisely whom to go to and who was responsible.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="08011060000167">I talked to my local county council before this debate, which said that it is now subject to approximately 200 separate targets or standards set by central government or often arising from European initiatives, especially on the environment. Councils must follow set rules. Then there is the financial aspect. Because of the changes in local finance arrangements over the years, the vast proportion of the money comes from central government, which has a dramatic effect on how rates move. A shift in local government resources up or down is greatly multiplied at the ratepayer level. That is the reality of life and it diminishes the authority of members of the councils in the eyes of the public. There is no longer the clarity of responsibility that used to exist.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="08011060000168">I accept that it is necessary to have clearly defined standards on the environment, but the micromanagement of the economy of local authorities has not helped their standing, although they can take decisions that matter&#151;I pay tribute to those who take on that responsibility&#151;and they do an extremely good job in increasingly difficult circumstances. We need to recognise the enormous contribution that local authorities make to British society, which benefits hugely from the voluntary sector&#151;in this sense, local government is a voluntary sector&#151;where people do everything they possibly can, generally successfully, to make the system work effectively in the interests of their community. I pay serious tribute to the people who do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="08011060000169">I do not think that there will ever be an ideal situation&#151;a sort of Utopia or community where everybody feels properly involved in everything. Society moves on. We are having a good debate this afternoon, but if I may be allowed to say it&#151;this is not meant to be an acid comment, as I am one of them&#151;we are a group of relatively aged people. I suspect that if we talked to the young they would think that we were having a wonderful waffle about something that does not really matter. If we want to communicate with them, we probably need to do it on the internet, which leads us into the business of community petitions and so on, in which some people will get interested.</p>

One of the issues with which we should concern ourselves relates to&#151;I will not say the alienation of the younger generation, because that implies antagonism&#151;the fact that, in my experience, younger generations are reluctant to get involved in public life in the way that was quite usual when I started.</p>

That is immensely sad. I do not know what we are going to do about that. It is an issue that has nothing to do with politics and something to do with the way we lead our lives.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="08011060000172">The uncertainty introduced by increasing central government intervention in local government has made matters worse. Another aspect that still causes me some concern, inevitably, is that for 40 years there has been no sense of constitutional stability for local government to rely on. Forty years covers a great many Governments of different political persuasions, so this is not a party-political issue. The structure of local government has not been stable for that length of time and is still not stable. There are still rumbles around the country over whether you should have this sort of organisation or that sort of organisation and so on. Everybody feels this uncertainty. We have a regional structure that was first to be made democratic and now is not to be. The regional assemblies are to go altogether and we will have regional development agencies. They, of course, have taken some authority away from county councils and, to some degree, unitary authorities. We are still in a state of flux.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="08011060000173">If I have a final message, it is that my contacts across the spectrum of local government all say, &#147;Please, if we could just leave things alone for a few years, we might be able to make them work&#148;. That will be real community government, because people will know where they stand. You cannot expect good communities&#151; I go back to the words of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ely&#151;to come together and work together in a really effective way without some degree of stability. That is a particular problem when we are developing new communities and we have to face it. People need stability if they are to be able to work together.</p>

There is no one in this House who could have opened this debate or steered it implicitly like the noble Lord, for all the reasons colleagues on his Benches have made clear. The noble Lord has written a book; we are still leafing through the index to some extent. I am grateful for the breadth of his introduction because we have had a very thoughtful debate, as much about the context in which we conduct community policies as the policies themselves.</p>

The right reverend Prelate, having chosen to join us, has added lustre to the company. It was extremely significant that he spoke from his experience as somebody who knows&#151;and, indeed, has written widely about&#151;the rural community. I hope I can give him every assurance that the rural community is important to everything we say in the document and our policies. How could it be otherwise? The right reverend Prelate

There is some excellent social enterprise work being done by the Ferry Project in Wisbech and the Huntingdonshire Youth Bank, which puts money directly into the hands of young people for them to decide how to spend it. That is the sort of example which might reassure the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, about young people&#146;s involvement in a range of voluntary organisations and their willingness to take responsibility and power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="08011060000176">I am grateful for the support I detected for the action plan. I hope to prove that it is both a plan and full of action which will be taken. I very much agree with much of what has been said this afternoon. Noble Lords are absolutely right in their critique of language; the language in this field is very difficult indeed. I agree that &#147;community empowerment&#148; is a clumsy term. I wish there was something that we could all agree on which would mean everything that we would want it to mean. It is difficult to find a word that does that. We talk about community involvement and influence. Wherever possible, we should always use the simplest and most direct and common language. We really must address this, and I promise to do so. It is quite a well known term but we will go on looking for words which mean &#147;enabling the people to become involved and influence the services and places they live in the best possible way&#148;. That is ultimately what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="08011060000177">Making this connection with the wider community will be a defining mark of this Government, making going beyond the town hall a clear priority and making practical propositions. That is one of the things that make it different and new. We are looking at a set of practical propositions in our action plan. I would not say that they are processes; they are new tools. Some are not that new, because they have been used and developed by the best councils, but bringing them together in a strategy plan is new.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="08011060000178">We have heard different versions of the personal journeys that noble Lords have made this afternoon, including, I am pleased to say, from my noble friend Lord Graham. They have been reflected by the Government&#146;s journey because things have changed from the days of mass protests, when getting involved meant going to a meeting. It is not like that any more and we must recognise and address that. Since 2000, we have been engaged on a genuine journey of devolution which started with Scotland and Wales and ended up before Christmas, via the local government White Paper and the <I>Governance of Britain </I>Green Paper, with a concordat between central and local government which consolidated that relationship. It was very seriously negotiated and not something where it was said &#147;Let&#146;s do that because it&#146;ll look good&#148; at all. It said, for the first time, that local and central government have a responsibility to use tax payers&#146; money well, devolve power and engage and empower communities and individual citizens at local and national levels in debate, decision making, and shaping and delivering services. That is quite simple language.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1022"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 1022</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80110-0012.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="08011060000179">Behind and underneath all that is a set of problems which community engagement is designed to help us solve. Among them are the self-evident problems that noble Lords have addressed today in many different ways: the challenge of building trust and coherence in a complex, diverse and fragmented society, and in rural communities where isolation is often visible and yet invisible when one thinks about young people, for example. People who engage and are active in their communities build up what we call &#147;social capital&#148;, enabling them to build communities, connect, and do and change things together.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="08011060000180">Secondly, there is the challenge of the democratic deficit. There is low participation in all forms of elections. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, talked about the ageing of the councillors; the average is 58.3 years, and only 3.5 per cent of councillors are under 30. One of the paradoxes is that there is no shortage of interest in how local government spends its money or provides services. There is evidence to suggest that the action plan and its actions can be made successful because people want to be informed and involved. Some 71 per cent of non-voters said they were likely to get involved in a process where they decided how and where local money is spent, and 80 per cent of people agree that they would engage more if they had been aware of the opportunity to do so, and given help and advice. Yes, we have that hierarchy where 15 per cent are very active and 15 per cent do not know or want to be involved. Yet there is, as the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, said, great potential for bringing in the community bystanders, not giving them tasks but enabling them to discover what they can do to change their communities.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="08011060000181">This is about designing, managing and changing policies and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, moving towards a shared understanding of where the problems are and so where the solutions are. One positive thing that takes us away from this suggestion that people will get involved only when they want to change or stop something is our experience in New Deal for Communities or our neighbourhood management. Ordinary people with skills they did not even know they had took on the responsibility for changing their communities, and have done so. We have seen, in those deprived and difficult communities, progress in the improvement of school standards, in the reduction of crime and in the improvement of housing and the environment. This has changed people&#146;s perceptions about the places in which they live. That is positive community involvement.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="08011060000182">I am sure the right reverend Prelate was right when he said that we recognise community when it is not there, but people I see when going to these communities are also very clear about what is changing and what is good about where they live. That is what we want to be able to spread. I note the assertion of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that nothing here is new. What is new about how we have approached this is that, first, involving people in helping find the solutions is now essential to what the Government are trying to do and the way they are trying to do it. I give all credit to the Secretary of State for making this a personal and political priority. It is certainly central to my department in the way we are trying to transform communities  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1023"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 1023</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the way we provide housing and new communities. The right reverend Prelate was right; of course we must not just build houses, and we do not intend to. It is a challenge to build communities where they do not exist and to change communities that do. Yet it is community planning&#151;master-planning with the community resource and infrastructure at its heart&#151;that will help us get from the beginning a sense of what the community wants. That is what we are trying to do.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="08011060000183">The second difference is that it is about direct levers. I will come on to illustrate that with a few examples. Thirdly, it is different because it is about the whole of Government. This is not something that the department which is called &#147;Communities&#148; has to deal with alone. We have to move this out across Whitehall. For example, in the youth action plan, the emphasis is put on young people making changes and giving them money as well as power to determine the sorts of facilities they want in their communities. There is the involvement of children in the children plan. The LINKs network in health is another radical change, going beyond the usual suspects to determine what is best in terms of social care. There is a sea change in the way the Government are drawing on these resources&#151;because that is what they are.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="08011060000184">The action plan is ambitious; it is a major plan. It starts with the need for cultural change, the duty to involve a radical step which requires local authorities to show that they have involved the community. We recently published draft statutory guidance on both that and local strategic partnerships, and community strategies in relation to that. We are now looking for the best ways of doing that. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, referred to the 200 targets that are involved in many local authorities&#146; decisions at the moment. There used to be 1,200 targets and we have made a quite significant change there. We will be consulting on draft regulations soon and guidance on the duty in the Sustainable Communities Act. But we in the department are also wrestling with the problem of the particular form of communities. I absolutely take the point that there are many different definitions of community, as there are many different types of communities&#151;whether ethnic communities, communities of interest, or whatever.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="08011060000185">We are dealing with problems of community cohesion: the need to find ways to promote the sort of social engagement that enables the building of trust in communities which are very diverse. Our Connecting Communities fund is making that a reality by supporting the work of minority ethnic groups through community networks; for example, helping them to run citizens&#146; days so that they get to know each other.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="08011060000186">On housing and planning, two Bills are coming forward from another place very shortly. The Housing Bill will give tenants and residents more power to shape their lives and their housing conditions. The Planning Bill, contrary to popular mythology, is creating more opportunity at three different stages of the planning process to involve people in what is happening in their communities. That is about creating different cultures and opening doors.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para24">

That is why we announced 10 pilot areas in July and a further 12 last month, because we are ambitious for every local authority in the country to offer that within five years. I can say to the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, that those are not just words; this is real difference. It will work and it will happen, because people want it.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="08011060000189">We talked also about the need to improve services. You can do that in two ways&#151;we have chosen two. Through local charters, which are more strategic, we want councils to work more visibly with the community as a whole. On the question raised by the noble Lord about what constitutes a community in that sense, it can be a community organisation or an alliance of community organisations. That will be determined locally. We are issuing guidance across the country in March for local authorities wanting to develop charters. Then there are petitions. I heard what the noble Baroness said, but she will know that we are building on the Councillors&#146; Commission. I am sure that the consultative process will throw up many ideas and comments on that. We will publish responses on both those issues later this year, and we will draft legislation if necessary.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="08011060000190">All that will change, strengthen and galvanise local democracy, which is what it is intended to do. We also need to tackle the malaise in local government: the failures represented by ageing structures and the unattractiveness of a proposition that used to be so much connected with civic pride. That is where the Roberts commission has fitted in. We are now looking in detail at its recommendations, which are many and various, and will respond to it. What it says about local government is also being reflected in the work being done by the Darzi commission and the Flanagan review of the police force. How do we bring in more people, how do we get them to take responsibility for the things that really affect and harm their lives?</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="08011060000191">We cannot do any of that unless we provide support mechanisms. I have a bit of jargon here. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, mentioned the network of empowering authorities, which is what it is. It is a core of 80 local authorities which will be the trailblazers for good practice. They will work together to spread the message: this is how things can change and work. We need those people to help us do that. They will not listen to us, but they will listen to local authorities who have done it for themselves. Alongside that we will have a national partnership of all those bodies which bring together ideas&#151;the IDeA, the LGA, the Urban Forum&#151;giving serious purpose to what will

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="08011060000192">My noble friend asked how you measure success. That is a very important question. Public Service Agreement No. 21 seeks to build more cohesive, active and empowered communities. We will not only be seeking to meet that target; we are also finding new ways of measuring participation, both active and passive. We are doing a citizenship survey, for example, to look at everything from school governorship to who and how many sign local petitions. Through the national census of local authority councillors, we will be measuring the profile of councillors. Noble Lords are also right to ask about resources. These are not simply words; they are not even simply good ideas. There will be investment in this&#151;&#163;35 million has been committed to underpin the action plan.</p>

<a name="80110-0012.htm_para30">
<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="08011060000193">Having gone through rather rapidly and superficially what is in this plan and what it signifies, I hope noble Lords agree that what is different is that there are new opportunities. There is a new seriousness, a new centrality of purpose. There are ways of enthusing people, young and old, in these programmes and of holding out a better future. There is connectivity between the range of things that local government can do and what the community wants to do for itself. We can open doors. It is uncomfortable but we have to face those realities. If we have the principles and some of the processes right, and the ambition, we can actually do it. As for making community a reality, to return to where the right reverend Prelate started, if we can recognise in five years&#146; time a community by what it has rather than by what it has lost, we will be on the way to making genuine change.</p>

While welcoming the official dialogue, which commenced in 1997&#151;eight years after the Tiananmen Square massacre&#151;and which seeks to deepen an understanding of human rights issues on both sides, I want to ask the Government what benchmarks they use to assess the success of that approach, and whether they see this year as a unique opportunity to deepen an awareness of the centrality of human rights to China&#146;s relationship with the rest

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="08011067000005">I also want to flag up a number of specific concerns, and I am grateful to all noble Lords who are to speak later and who will enlarge on these points and raise others. Let me begin with the use of the death penalty. It is estimated that each year some 8,000 executions take place in China. Last June, the state media suggested that there had been,</p>
<ul><a name="08011067000146">&#147;fewer executions after legal reforms&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011067000120">Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether we have been able to assess the veracity of that claim. For instance, are appeals against the death penalty being held in open court and have we made progress in calling for national data on the use of the death penalty to be collated and published?</p>

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="08011067000006">Disturbingly, the death penalty is used for 68 different offences in China, including non-violent crimes such as embezzlement and drugs-related offences. In July last, Zhang Ning, former chief accountant of the railway bureau in Lanzhou city, Gansu province, was sentenced to death after soliciting bribes and using public funds in failed investments. Later that month, Zheng Xiaoyu, former director of the State Food and Drug Administration, was executed after conviction for accepting bribes.</p>

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="08011067000007">Other aspects of the judicial system also give cause for concern. Detention without trial and the use of &#147;re-education through labour" is widely used. In the run-up to the Olympics, it is reported that the Beijing city authorities have used a &#147;strike hard&#148; campaign of detention to crack down on groups such as beggars, vagrants and unlawful taxi drivers. &#147;Re-education through labour&#148; and the use of detention as a punishment without trial is a flagrant violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed and has declared its intention to ratify.</p>

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="08011067000008">I hope that the Government will tell us what progress is being made on ratification and on other outstanding undertakings, such as implementation of the United Nations convention against torture and on issues such as freedom of expression.</p>

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="08011067000009">In 2001, the authorities declared that there would be complete media freedom for the Olympic Games; namely, that 30,000 foreign journalists will be able to report without restriction, which is welcome. But how does that compare with the treatment of China&#146;s own journalists? Amnesty says that one reporter, Lan Chengzhang, was beaten to death last year and journalists who then reported his case in the journal <I>Democracy and Legal Times</I> were dismissed. In July, the <I>China Development Brief </I>was banned.</p>

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="08011067000010">Meanwhile, internet censorship has intensified, with websites regularly closed down. It is estimated that there could be 187 million internet search users by the close of this year. What a tragedy that Microsoft, Google and Yahoo have all collaborated in the censoring of the web. Microsoft blocks words such as &#147;freedom&#148;, &#147;democracy&#148; and &#147;demonstration&#148;, while Yahoo deplorably decided to provide to the state information about Shi Tao, a journalist with <I>Contemporary Business News</I> in Hunan province.

In the long term, trying to erect a great firewall and a great wall of the airwaves will not serve China&#146;s interests. Unsurprisingly, human rights activities fare no better than those of journalists. In July last, the death was reported of Chen Xiaoming, a Shanghai activist, who was reportedly stripped naked, physically abused, held at a secret location, denied family access, and when released was barely alive, dying one month later of a massive haemorrhage.</p>

China is the only country in the world where it is illegal to have a brother or a sister. Female foeticide has led to a population imbalance of 117 men to every 100 women, and that is leading to catastrophic social consequences.</p>

I wonder what the Minister can tell us about Chen&#146;s current position. I hope that he will also tell the House what proportion of our continued financial support for the United Nations population fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation is channelled to the Chinese Population Association, the arm of the state responsible for those policies. In 2006-07 DfID gave &#163;25 million to the UNFPA and &#163;7.6 million to the IPPF.</p>

Millions of underground Christians, Catholic and Protestant, have also faced persecution for their beliefs. An article in this week&#146;s <I>Tablet</I> says that up to a dozen Catholic bishops remain incarcerated&#151;under house arrest, in police custody or in hiding. Forty of China&#146;s 100 Catholic dioceses have no bishop and the Holy See remains unrecognised.

In addition, Tian Mingwei and Su Dean, two prominent Protestant leaders of one of China&#146;s largest house church networks, are currently being detained by local police in Jiuquan City, Gansu province, arrested on 20 December 2007.

Their arrest comes just two days after President Hu Jintao presented and reiterated a policy of religious freedom at a session of the politburo of the Communist Party focusing on religion. While such statements are welcomed, they must be weighed by the realities experienced on the ground by China&#146;s religious believers&#148;.</p>

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="08011067000018">We cannot and should not ignore such realities. As China flexes its economic muscle and enjoys unprecedented economic growth, there needs to be a commensurate change in the way it dispenses justice and deals with human rights. Change at home will influence its actions overseas and within the region&#151;in its relations with Tibet and Taiwan, and in the way it deals with issues such as the repatriation of North Korean refugees. I particularly welcome its helpful role, and that of our own Government, in the recent case of Yoo Sang-joon, who was due to be repatriated to North Korea where he would have faced execution. Similarly, China could win widespread acclaim if it used its influence to put pressure on Burma to recognise and free Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="08011067000019">Elsewhere in the world, China has begun to take more account of international opinion, as its foreign policy in North Korea and Sudan has revealed, and it could also exercise great influence in other parts of Africa, especially Zimbabwe.</p>

In a brilliant speech, he has highlighted many of the appalling human rights abuses perpetrated by the People&#146;s Republic of China, and your Lordships will find that there are many more examples described on the Amnesty International website. I intend to concentrate on another aspect of China&#146;s human rights record in my speech&#151;the treatment of the 23 million citizens of its neighbouring country, Taiwan. In doing so, I declare an interest as co-chairman of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group and as a visitor to that country on a number of occasions.</p>

<a name="80110-0013.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="08011067000022">Taiwanese human rights are being threatened in a number of ways. For example, there are around 1,000 missiles on the coast of China aimed directly at the heart of Taiwan. The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs in another place published an excellent report on east Asia in August 2006 that dealt with this subject. At paragraph 173, the committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"><a name="08011067000139">&#147;We conclude that the Chinese military build-up across the Taiwan Straits threatens peace and stability in East Asia ... We further conclude that the growth of democracy in Taiwan is of the greatest importance, both for the island itself and for the population of greater China, since it demonstrates incontrovertibly that Chinese people can develop democratic institutions and thrive under them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011067000123">The PRC has backed up its threat of force with the passing of a so-called anti-secession law, which purports to give China the right to intervene militarily to force the reunification of Taiwan with the mainland. There are other equally unsubtle attacks on the human rights of the people of Taiwan. China has campaigned, so far successfully, to ensure Taiwan&#146;s exclusion from world bodies such as the United Nations and the World Health Organisation. It demands that other countries deny Taiwan recognition and seeks to humiliate Taiwanese public figures by pressuring Governments around the world not to permit the fundamental rights of travel and free association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="08011067000023">This might not matter so much if China was the only country to behave like that towards Taiwan, but sadly that is not the case, as we all know. Unfortunately, Her Majesty&#146;s Government appear as enthusiastic as any in support of the so-called One China policy. You get the flavour of this when you read the opening words of the FCO&#146;s country brief on Taiwan on its website:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"><a name="08011067000140">&#147;The United Kingdom acknowledges the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of China and recognises the Chinese Government as the sole legal government of China.

In terms of human rights, there was little to choose between them. Both operated a one-party dictatorship&#151;parliamentary democracy was non-existent&#151;and both

In his letter to me and to the co-chairman of the all-party Taiwan group, Sir Nicholas Winterton MP, my noble friend described Taiwan as,</p>
<ul><a name="08011067000148">&#147;a major Asian economy and vibrant democracy, and an important trade and investment partner for the UK. There are flourishing links in a wide range of areas, including business, education and culture. We wish to see these links continue to develop&#148;.</ul>

President Ahtisaari says that the new Kosovan constitution must be drafted and adopted by Kosovans and that Kosovo must have its own flag, seal and anthem, and the right to negotiate and conclude international agreements, including the right to seek membership of international organisations. My two questions are simple. First, if we are right to support Kosovan independence from Serbia, why do we refuse to support Taiwanese independence from China, based on similar principles? Secondly, what more must Taiwan do to demonstrate its credentials as a democratic state and as a friend of the United Kingdom?</p>

China never engaged in the slave trade and has no colonial past; on the contrary, it supported liberation movements, if only initially to counter Soviet influence. It has a pragmatic and non-conditional approach to investment and aid on the basis of equal to equal. It does not bother with human rights. African observers such as Moeletsi Mbeki are well aware that China deals with political leaders and is not interested in governance, investing where the need for its expanding industrial power can be met in oil, cobalt, precious metals, woods and other things. It creates some of the infrastructure that many countries need&#151;mines, dams, electrical power&#151;often bringing in Chinese to do the work rather than providing local employment. It accepts and uses the almost universal corruption that obtains among African leaders, and is not unknown in China, and has no tradition of deference to human rights.</p>

In earlier times the Chinese, building the pipeline to the Red Sea, were, like the Sudanese Government, wholly unconcerned by the displacement of thousands. They shared the views of, for instance, the Sudanese Government that any civil resistance to work conditions in Chinese enterprises must expect to be met with force, as it would have been in China. Equally, the threat to the environment from illegal logging and fishing does not concern them; the choice of dam sites on the Zambezi is determined by the economic and not by the environmental or human factors. We should be ready to help to recover for any free Zimbabwe Government that may eventually emerge any major assets that have been arbitrarily ceded to Chinese interests by ZANU-PF Ministers without due process.</p>

The Sino-African partnership in the UN is becoming a powerful factor in determining international policy, not only in Africa.

HMG should not be afraid to attack corruption among African leaders, to refuse to support such men with unaccountable budgets from DfID or to allow China&#146;s appalling record to pass unnoticed. Not least, HMG should be restoring our diplomatic presence, which was withdrawn lately from some African countries. Men and women who understand and respect African thinking, including tribalism and African history, are far more valuable conduits to civil society than NGOs, however well meaning, the UN or the Word Bank. The Chinese are on the ground and we have to face that. I hope that our people will know enough not to say, &#147;Kenya and Pakistan both have a heritage as British colonies&#148;. Pakistan was created by partition at the behest of Nehru and Jinnah in the last days of the British Raj, which was administered by the Indian Political Service. It was never a colony.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="08011067000035">I will end with one anecdote. In the last Zambian elections, someone who was canvassing against the Government was rightly extremely angry about the flooding of the country with cheap Chinese goods and much more about the conditions in the copper mines, where people were being brutally treated. When he was enlarging on this, the Chinese ambassador suggested that any more of this and China would withdraw its support if he were to be elected. I suppose that that is a very practical approach, but it is not one that one can regard with any kind of sympathy. I very much hope that HMG will fight in every possible way Chinese breaches of human rights. However, I recognise that China is a large, powerful and great country and we shall have to have very effective means of bringing our own views to bear on it. Personally, I think that China&#146;s own interests will eventually move in that direction, but I think that that will be a long time coming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="08011067000037">I visited Shanghai for the first time last November. I had been to China a good number of times but never to Shanghai. Like many people, including many noble Lords who have been to Shanghai, I was startled by the city&#146;s exuberance and the sheer momentum of what is going on there. It is very striking.</p>

<a name="80110-0014.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="08011067000038">I was, incidentally, pleased to see that the Bund on the riverfront is now protected. It gives the city, despite the skyscrapers, a really important and distinctive visual character. It also says something quite important about the international nature of Shanghai. I feel that there may be something in the Chinese scene whereby Shanghai plays a role slightly akin to that of St Petersburg in Russia. It is the international opening and a very important city in that context. It is certainly an important prism through which to view some of the issues in this debate on, &#147;China&#146;s role in promoting and respecting human rights&#148;. Why? Shanghai demonstrates China&#146;s determination to make capitalism work for it. We may find that a strange and contradictory concept but it is the reality. The Chinese are not playing with capitalism; they want it to work and they believe that it is the essential method by which China&#146;s living standards will be raised. Secondly, it shows China&#146;s clear demonstration intention, Shanghai being such an international city, to be massively active as an investor, importer and exporter in global markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="08011067000039">Why are these factors so crucial for human rights and developments in human rights? It is because they are the motors of change, and change is what we need to see in Chinese civil society. We should never underestimate the rapidity of change. I was in Shanghai to lecture at the Shanghai International Studies University, which is one of the focus points in China for the acquisition of foreign languages. I would remind your Lordships that some 300 million people are studying English in China. The reason for that focus on the English language&#151;which of course carries many values of civil society within the language&#151;is their determination to succeed individually and collectively as part of a globalised economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="08011067000040">As for internal change and human rights in China, I think there has been one reference so far in the debate to China&#146;s membership of the WTO, which started in 2001&#151;not all that long ago. Part of China&#146;s commitment in its acquisition of WTO membership was a commitment to,</p>

<p><a name="08011067000041">It is important, in seeing where we go from this point, to understand the extent to which China&#146;s commercial and entrepreneurial ambition has as its concomitant a recognition of the need to create a civil society and a law-based society.

The point has already been vividly and powerfully made that China plays an increasingly important role as an investor in construction and an importer of raw materials. The figures are quite extraordinary. China is doubling its imports of minerals, oil and energy year on year. That has a paradoxical impact on us: whereas cheap products from China are, in price terms, deflationary in the West, the import of raw materials by China is now a very important inflationary force within the western economies.</p>

The Uighurs have stronger ethnic and historic links with their ex-Soviet neighbours and since 1949 there has been discrimination against them in every sphere: in employment, education, religion, even in marriage.

The Uighur diaspora is now widespread. Many have fled across neighbouring borders, although there have been cases of refugees sent back from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Some migrate as far as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, or seek asylum in Sweden and the US. Twenty-three Uighurs from Pakistan ended up in Guantanamo.

While we recognise and celebrate the advances that China is making as an economic superpower, we must continue to assess and question China's role in promoting and respecting human rights, which we cannot ignore, even more so in light of its economic success. China has taken some steps in advancing its promotion of human rights, but there is no denying that China needs to go further in this area. I hope that the Minister will answer the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on whether the Chinese Government have indicated when it may ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Like my noble friend Lady Park of Monmouth, I would like to direct part of my speech to China's efforts in Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="08011067000059">China has been a key supporter of Robert Mugabe, a man who has sparked political fury across the globe with his most questionable leadership in Zimbabwe. It has been only a few months since China dropped assistance to the Mugabe regime, but we are aware that it is still assisting with humanitarian aid, which remains a positive step, especially with China expressing its desire to work more closely with the international community.</p>

<a name="80110-0014.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="08011067000060">It was widely reported that, in the Minister's discussions with China last year, China expressed a wish to work more closely with the international community to bring peace to Darfur, particularly as previously it had been seen not to acknowledge the heartless policies of the Sudanese Government, who had continued to ignore the basic human rights of large parts of the Sudanese population. It appears that China is beginning to take its relationship with the African countries and with the international community more seriously; in particular, China has recognised that Zimbabwe is an out-of-control, failed state. In 2006, the GDP growth for China was 10.7 per cent, which has fuelled a rapid growth in tracking sources of oil in major oil-producing countries which pose high risks to inward investors, particularly when the rest of the world is reluctant to engage in contracts due to the challenging positions facing them when they choose to invest, particularly in Africa.</p>

<a name="80110-0014.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="08011067000061">China's investment in Sudan, Nigeria, Angola and the Republic of Congo, to name but a few, is, as reported, the reason for China&#146;s 40 per cent total growth in the demand for oil, with figures from reports claiming that Chinese companies had invested $175 million in the first 10 months of 2005 in African countries. Figures have suggested that China is taking up to 64 per cent of Sudan&#146;s oil exports, and we must remember that Sudan remains one of the world&#146;s poorest countries. While China continues to export oil out of Africa, the people of Africa remain poor, with the majority of Africans in abject poverty, corruption and suffering severe violations of their human rights.</p>

<a name="80110-0014.htm_para28">
<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="08011067000062">It is only right that we continue to monitor and assess the role that China is playing in Africa. It has been estimated that by 2045 China will depend on imported oil for 45 per cent of its energy needs. To ease the effect such trading has on Africa, experts have said that China has an aid-for-oil strategy, and with such limited time I feel that this is a debate to be had in its own right.</p>

<a name="80110-0014.htm_para29">
<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="08011067000063">As we see China striking deals with countries and Governments from across the globe, it is important that as an international leader it is aware of the destruction and violation of the human rights of the people in those countries where arms are traded in exchange for good oil prices. Equipping countries such as the Sudan, Zimbabwe and Nigeria, China is gaining strong political allies, succeeding in fulfilling political goals, but diverting attention from not addressing its own poor human rights record.</p>

The Africans are mainly cut out of jobs as China underbids local firms, but it can be argued that, where most global powers have not taken to being more practical in their help to rebuild many of the African countries, China has cashed in on such opportunities.</p>

<a name="80110-0014.htm_para31">
<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="08011067000065">The issue of the rights of people in China has been a long-standing debate but, with the successful bidding for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, the eyes of the world are even more on China. I have recently read that the authorities have given permission to the police to hold and detain dozens of activists, outspoken intellectuals and human rights lawyers, including the arrest of Hu Jia&#151;as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich&#151;reportedly one of the biggest targets for the authorities, as it was said that he had gathered and distributed information on the Government&#146;s human rights abuse. Is the Minister aware of such actions?</p>

<a name="80110-0014.htm_para32">
<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="08011067000066">When China won the bid to host the Games in 2001, it made a pledge to the world that it would take steps to improve its human rights record. One of the human rights issues that has come to the fore is the abuse of media freedom. On the rebuilding programmes going on in the run-up to the Games, it has been reported and seen that workers are being cheated out of wages and are working under dangerous conditions with no access to medical and accident insurance. With much redevelopment taking place, many local residents have been forced to move from their homes without compensation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="08011067000067">In conclusion, while we see that China is making huge leaps in the global economy and positive impacts in Africa, it is important to assess China&#146;s role in promoting and respecting its own human rights record. With the Olympic Games taking place in Beijing we can see that China must play an active part in aiding its own people and serving them with the freedoms that they should be enjoying while the rest of the world comes to its door to celebrate the Games. Its relationship with Africa may be of economic fruitfulness, but we must not be blinded by the human rights violations that are still taking place within a rapidly expanding power.</p>

Coming near the end of the debate, there is no need to raise more individual questions of abuses of human rights in China. There are plenty of examples and I am sure that they are real ones.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="08011067000069">It is interesting to realise that recently at the Communist Party Congress at the end of October last year, the President of China, Hu Jintao, said that it was necessary to,</p>

<p><a name="08011067000070">One can question what that means in practice, but can one imagine 20 years ago the President of China saying that this should be an objective? Here, surely, is something that we can build on.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="08011067000071">The other part of the context, I suggest, is the massive internal development of China. The noble Lord, Lord Watson, referred very movingly to what Shanghai looks like. The same is true of Beijing and Guangzhou, or Canton. There is massive development. What we hear much less about is the enormous disparity of wealth between the countryside and the cities. Something like 50 per cent of China&#146;s wealth is in the control of something like 10 per cent of the population. Virtually all those people live in the cities. The influx of people from the countryside to the cities is absolutely enormous. It is estimated that there are something like 200 million migrant workers in the cities of China at the moment and that they will continue to move into the cities at a rate of 15 million per year, probably for the next 20 years. The conclusion is that governing China is no easy task for anybody.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="08011067000072">Other noble Lords have referred to another part of the context: the enormous economic growth of China over the past few years and its impact on China&#146;s role in the world. China is already the fourth largest economy in the world and the figures for 2007 will probably show China overtaking the UK to become the third largest. Inevitably, this dramatically affects China&#146;s position in the world and its relationship with other countries, including the UK. Recently, the very effective Chinese ambassador to London, Madame Fu Ying, came to Cambridge to address members of the university. She made a point of saying that the world tended to see China as an elephant, while those involved in formulating Chinese policies tended to see it as a mouse. The reason for this is that while the world sees China as huge, powerful and significant, the policymakers in China see instead all the problems that they face. I would not dare to pick certain animals from the Chinese zodiac, particularly not the next one on the calendar, which might be misunderstood, but a tiger is a better animal to choose than either an elephant or a mouse.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="08011067000073">The really important point is that now, inevitably, China is being drawn into discussion of key world issues in a way that has not been true in the past. Previously, China has been able to say that it does not involve itself in the internal affairs of other countries. That is no longer possible. As other noble Lords have said, China already plays a significant role and, in many places, a very positive role. Examples include North Korea and Iran on nuclear matters, and also Burma, to some extent. There is huge involvement in Africa. It must surely be our objective, picking up on what noble Lords have said, to make that as positive as possible. China is also involved in UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="08011067000074">In this context, we already have a widely based dialogue with China. That is something on which we can build. It is in that forum that one can and should raise the question of human rights as something that is important for its own sake and important for the economic development of China. Doing it in a much broader context means that one does not run into the

Put into a wider context it can be dealt with in a different way.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="08011067000075">To pick up on another point from the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, China has made enormous strides in the development of its legal system over the past 20 years. Of course, there is still a long way to go. The Chinese leaders recognise that. At the Communist Party Congress last October, President Hu Jintao spoke of the importance of the rule of law as &#147;a fundamental principle&#148;. We in the UK have helped in the past with the training of Chinese lawyers and judges. A lot of this has been done through the British Council. Some of it, interestingly, has been done in Scotland, because the Roman law basis of the Scottish legal system is often easier for the Chinese to latch onto than the common law tradition in England. A lot has been done, and I am sure that a lot more could be done.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="08011067000076">In conclusion, I ask the Minister, first, to tell us something about the wider context of our discussions with China on a broad range of international issues and how the human rights issue could be inserted into them, and, secondly, what the British Government think that they can go on doing to help the Chinese to help themselves to develop a sound rule of law, both for China&#146;s own sake and because that is, after all, a key element in helping to improve a record of human rights.</p>

I declare my interests as chairman of the British Olympic Association, a director of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and a member of the Olympic board for the Olympics to be held here in London in 2012. The subject of my speech will come as little surprise to noble Lords this evening. I have also sustained a strong personal interest in foreign affairs and human rights, two subjects which dominated the years during which I had the honour and good fortune to sit on the Front Bench as senior foreign affairs spokesman for my party, a humble predecessor to the eminent current incumbent, my noble friend Lord Howell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="08011067000078">Many noble Lords have referred to the problematic nature of China&#146;s human rights record and, indeed, that of a number of other countries in the region. Noble Lords have referred to breaches in human rights which are clearly unacceptable in the 21st century. Every part of the international community must strive to do what it can to move the issue forward.

However, neither the

Expectations of an Olympics-led metamorphosis are simply unrealistic. Real change requires consolidation of the position of China's domestic reformers and a wider public recognition of human rights. It would not be unusual for this to take many more years&#151;in effect, another generation. Indeed, one of the major challenges will be how the momentum for change will be sustained after the curtain comes down on the Games in Beijing. Nor can, or should, the International Olympic Committee be expected to solve a problem to which the Governments of the international community have yet to find an answer.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="08011067000080">At the same time, it would be wrong to underestimate the growing national influence of sport and the power of the Olympic movement. For just as China's human rights record fits uneasily with the Olympic ideals, so too does the idea that sport can harbour prejudice, geographical or otherwise. The goal of Olympism is to spread fundamental human values as widely as possible and not to confine them exclusively to the western world, as we tended to do in the 20th century. Sport is about humanity.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="08011067000081">An argument for why the 2008 Summer Olympics should be held in Beijing is that sport in itself is a force for good. It is a mass phenomenon which gives enjoyment to hundreds of millions of people every week. We have gone far beyond the principle of the value of sport as simply entertainment. That has been recognised, not least in the 1978 International Charter of Physical Education and Sport, which places the development of physical education and sport at the service of human progress. Sport has a role to play in society. At all levels, it is influential and pervasive. By their very nature, sport and physical education are about participation, inclusion and a sense of belonging. Sport, as a universal language, can help to promote peace, tolerance, reconciliation and understanding. It cuts across lines of class, nationhood, ethnicity and culture that might otherwise divide, and it is an exceptional vehicle for bringing people together, bridging differences and promoting communication and understanding.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="08011067000082">For example, sport has helped reinitiate dialogue where other channels have struggled. A tradition of such sports diplomacy has certainly played its part in Asia. North and South Korea promoted reconciliation by merging their athletes into a common team for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Table tennis set the stage for the resumption of diplomatic ties between China and the United States in 1971. Elsewhere, Israeli and Palestinian children regularly come together to play soccer or basketball. If anyone doubted the extraordinary power of sport, they would have to look no further than last year&#146;s Asian Football Cup. In Iraq, riven by sectarian violence and turmoil, there are few rays of hope. Yet Shia, Sunni and Kurdish players made up the Iraqi team and, putting aside the differences that separate them in their own country, they came together as one team to win the Asian Football Cup. The uplift to the Iraqi people as a result of that victory of their national team stands as a testament to what sport can do to bring people together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="08011067000083">Despite this evidence, we have heard some calls for a boycott of the Games, not least from Edward Macmillan-Scott, a member of my own party in the European Parliament. I recognise that boycotts can in some cases be successful, but not in this case. As the noble Lord, Lord Watson, rightly argued, China is at an important stage in its development. As a nation, it will also play a key role in all of our futures. We need to help open up China to the rest of the world, to integrate and to cultivate relationships, to shine a spotlight, as the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, has done today, on the issues which concern us, and to work together to encourage resolutions. It is incumbent on all of us involved with the Olympic movement to play our role in this. It is also incumbent on those involved with the IOC fully to engage with all the issues of a host nation in order to ensure that the principles of Olympism and the Olympic ideals are promulgated as effectively and as widely as possible. Human rights, educational programmes and environmental matters are all on the agenda of those whose lives are impacted by sport, and indeed the IOC. As I was leaving the IOC headquarters in Lausanne only last month, I was passed by three members representing a human rights group, drawn from a demonstration outside, who were welcomed into discussion with IOC executives.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="08011067000084">We should not forget the progress which has been made since Beijing was awarded the Games, a direct consequence of the strength of the sports movement to which I have referred. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, acknowledged in his speech, foreign journalists are, for the first time, welcomed without restriction. Amnesty International has recognised that positive steps have been taken in relation to the death penalty and to police brutality, while rightly continuing to focus on cases of human rights violations which have never before in history been under such a strong global spotlight of media, political and public attention&#151;and never would have been had the Games gone elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="08011067000085">In conclusion, the IOC has created a serious momentum for change by deciding to stage the Olympic Games in Beijing, a momentum that could generate pressure on the Chinese regime to change its behaviour and, at the very least, accelerate the process of instituting long-term reforms. Amidst concerns that this will not pay off, it is worth remembering that there would not have been the recent Chinese promises to improve human rights and press freedoms that we have heard about, fulfilled or not, without the Beijing Olympics. Beijing 2008 has pushed China&#146;s human rights record to the top of the international agenda for the next eight months. The challenge for politicians, human rights groups, the Chinese Government and the IOC is to work together to make the wisest use of this opportunity, to ensure that fundamental human rights are treated with a new-found respect in China. This is, after all, a fundamental goal of the Olympic movement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="08011067000087">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, said in the debate on the gracious Speech last November that China&#146;s huge and continuing economic success is by no means the only reason why its presence on the world stage is so important. He drew attention to the remarkable success of our agreement with China on Hong Kong as an indication of China&#146;s reliability as a partner in international agreements, to China&#146;s support for UNSCR 1769 on Darfur and to the visit by the UN special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, to Burma in October, as examples of China&#146;s increasing involvement in the solution of major problems on the UN&#146;s humanitarian and peacekeeping agendas. As has also been mentioned, the return of North Korea to the six-party talks on non-proliferation just after that debate was also attributed largely to Chinese diplomacy. China&#146;s involvement in key world issues was underlined again today by the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Tillyorn.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="08011067000088">It is common ground that in a few years China not only will have become the greatest economic power in the world but may also have assumed a much greater share of responsibility for upholding standards of governance, human rights and the rule of law that hitherto have been led by the West, through the motors of change referred to by my noble friend. It will be natural for China to develop those standards within its own borders and to promote them internationally, if only for reasons of self-interest. Several noble Lords mentioned Zimbabwe. The massive Chinese investment there and in other countries in Africa can be protected only if it is embedded in ordinary societies where people have rights protected by the Government and the rule of law. It is welcome that China has signed up to the six major human rights treaties&#151;although it has still to ratify the ICCPR&#151;and has thus acknowledged them as the yardsticks that need to be applied both at home and abroad.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="08011067000089">Where China falls short of complying with those obligations domestically, it is not very likely that it will promote them abroad. Amnesty International has provided us with a useful checklist. There is some progress. As has been mentioned, fewer death penalties are being imposed. Some restrictions on foreign journalists were lifted at the start of 2007, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, mentioned, but Reporters Without Borders says that since then it has received 180 reports of threats, physical violence, harassment, destruction of equipment, interrogation and visa refusals. In the run-up to the Olympic Games, that simply will not do, nor will the jamming of the BBC&#146;s Mandarin broadcast, which has also been mentioned. I should like to know what the Minister thinks we can do about that before the Olympic Games begin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="08011067000091">I suggest that there should be a single web portal that gives access to all the information available on the dialogues&#151;ours, those of the European Union, those of the Americans, and so on&#151;with links not only to the related material on Foreign Office websites but to the site of the reports of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, pointing the way to better co-ordination than we have at the moment on those processes. I know that there are periodic meetings of the dialogue partners, but one would like to see how that works and how the special procedures are fed into those discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="08011067000092">Let me give an example. The UN Rapporteur for Religious Freedom visited China in 1994 and made a series of recommendations, which could be used as the benchmarks proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, to measure the achievements of the dialogues. The FCO report says that no progress has been made on religious freedom, a key issue that was apparently raised without results at the EU-China dialogue last October. We have asked the Chinese to confirm when the UN rapporteur would be allowed to make a visit to follow up the 1994 recommendations and the Minister could perhaps say whether any answer to that has been received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="08011067000093">The issues of the gratuitous prohibition of the Falun Gong and the ill treatment of its adherents, as well as the relentless persecution of monks and nuns in Tibet, are taken up by Ministers, I know, at every opportunity and one hopes that these matters will be raised at the dialogue. The talks between the Chinese Government and representatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama are useful but, since the sixth round last July, the ball has been in the Chinese court to name the date and place for the next meeting. Meanwhile, the railway link to Lhasa has stimulated even higher rates of Chinese emigration, accelerating and undermining Tibetan cultural and spiritual identity, and, as the noble Lord knows, last September a regulation was passed providing that all lamas have to be approved by the Chinese authorities. If Beijing is playing for time, expecting that in a few years it will have extinguished Tibetan Buddhism, it is making a mistake, because the Dalai Lama is the spiritual head of a belief system that has a growing number of followers all over the world. This is the point where domestic human rights intercept with China&#146;s foreign policy, as obviously China is not going to be tough on the Burmese junta over the killings and arrests of monks and the closure of monasteries during the recent uprising when similar violations have been perpetrated in Tibet.</p>

For instance, the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, played a major part in preparing for the successful transfer of sovereignty in Hong Kong and probably knows more than almost anyone in this House or elsewhere about dealing with the Chinese people and their aspirations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="08011067000096">The conundrum about Britain and China is easily summed up. We want a strong relationship with China and all its peoples but we do not like some of the brutal methods employed in China today. The facts stare us in the face that China now already produces 16 per cent of the world&#146;s gross domestic product. That figure is measured in purchasing power parity terms and it is heading much higher. Last year China exported over $1 trillion of goods to the western world. We have a dilemma between what we like and do not like, and we try to bridge the gap by hoping that economic freedom will eventually lead to political freedom; by hoping that opening to world trade will lead to higher standards; by arguing, as my noble friend Lord Moynihan did with great eloquence and expertise, that sport and the Olympic Games&#146; spotlight will bring liberalisation, as I believe it may well do; and by hoping that the information revolution and the world wide web will mean less state dominance and more power dispersal from the centre. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, began by reminding us, that is going rather slowly when all the major search engines are collaborating with the repressive instincts in the Chinese Government. Above all we hope that China will change in line with the general patterns of global development, and it probably will, although in ways and patterns which will continue to baffle western political and economic theorists and not fit in with the kind of models and theories with which we are familiar in the western world.</p>

<a name="80110-0015.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="08011067000097">On the good side it needs to be said that although there are many aspects we thoroughly dislike, let us at least remember&#151;and we have been reminded in this debate&#151;that the Chinese Government are free of some of our own flaws and weaknesses in the West, such as the idiocies of multiculturalism and the fallacies in some of our aid policies, and that they have lifted 400 million people out of poverty through sheer enterprise and energy, leaving hundreds of millions more, as the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, reminded us, still in the countryside and crowding into the towns. Nevertheless, this is progress and it cannot be denied.</p>

Last year, sales to China increased by 50 per cent, which is evidence that something&#151;maybe not the right thing&#151;is certainly going on in that market, a market that we have to be in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="08011067000099">Of course, we do not want just markets from China, but responsibility and a measured weight in world affairs. We need China to be a force for stability in Africa, in central Asia, in Iran and in the Middle East. We want, indeed advise, those in China who will listen to us to adopt a less confrontational and more embracing approach to Taiwan, as the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, rightly reminded us. The idea that it will embrace the future Taiwan by firing rockets at it and mobilising military forces on the mainland is completely the wrong approach.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="08011067000100">I was especially struck too by the comments made by my noble friend Lady Park, which are always deeply perceptive. She is right to say that we must make sure that in Africa human rights are upheld, and that we point out to both the Chinese and the African people the benefits of pursuing the rule of law and upholding human rights. But we have to face a fact, which was encapsulated the other day in the rather disastrous EU-Africa meeting in Lisbon when one of the African leaders said, &#147;It is all very well lecturing us on human rights, but the plain fact is that you can buy two Chinese cars for one European car&#148;. That is the hard currency of the situation. If China can bring immediate, in-the-pocket benefits, it will prove to be a very attractive visitor and is beginning to exert an enormous influence, so that everywhere one goes in Africa now one sees signs of buildings and infrastructure labelled with Chinese symbols. That is what we are up against.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="08011067000101">My right honourable friend David Cameron, the leader of my party, was in Chongqing recently, where he made a very interesting comment at the university, which I have no hesitation in repeating. Addressing a Chinese audience, he said:</p>
<ul>

<p><a name="08011067000130">as we know,</p>
<ul><a name="08011067000154">&#147;and ten per cent of it comes from Sudan. So China has a direct national interest in working for stability in Sudan, and an end to the killings in Darfur&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011067000131">He went on to point out that:</p>

<p><a name="08011067000132">is not worse, but a more &#147;sustainable and brighter&#148; place for the future, as my noble friend Lady Verma rightly emphasised. He also pointed out that China should play a really responsible part in helping to,</p>
<ul><a name="08011067000155">&#147;resolve the Iranian nuclear crisis, because the proliferation of nuclear material endangers lives in Nanjing as much as it does in New York&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08011067000135">That is the language of talking direct to Chinese interests and Chinese realism, which is beginning to have some effect, as many of those participating in this debate have rightly said.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="08011067000102">In the end, the message we need to send to China&#151;not as lecturers from some superior moral position but as practical friends who want China to succeed and prosper&#151;is that more humane practices and a much deeper respect for human rights will benefit the Chinese people, as the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, rightly indicated, and will enable China to play its full, rightful and responsible role in world affairs in the 21st<sup></sup>century.

His interest in the subject reflects his overall commitment to human rights, for which I think we all commend him.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="08011067000104">This has been a typically interesting and thoughtful debate in which we all to a greater or lesser extent share the arguments made by the noble Lords, Lord Watson and Lord Wilson. Having come to China first as an expert on development rather than on human rights, I have always had to take into account the fact that China ranks in about the middle of the list in the UNDP Human Development Report. Although it scores poorly on the political criteria, it continues to score way above its per capita income level in terms of the economic and social criteria because of the improvements in life that it has created by lifting so many hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Yet if one looks at the more purely political league tables of human rights freedoms and political freedoms more generally&#151;that of Reporters Without Borders, which has been mentioned, or of Freedom House&#151;one finds China near the bottom of the list. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to this dilemma. We are in a sense investing in the idea that if China continues to enjoy strong economic progress, it will translate into greater political liberalisation.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="08011067000105">For those who make that case, such as on the Olympics, there is a precedent. I would argue that China&#146;s accession to the World Trade Organisation was a step change in many areas of internal freedom and in the introduction of at least pluralistic economic competitiveness into the Chinese economy. We hope, similarly, that the hosting of the Olympics will be another step change; not a temporary aberration where freedom is granted and then taken away but a process of locking in a greater degree of press and other freedoms.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="08011067000106">Similarly for those of us who believe that the way forward on human rights is through engagement with China and through China&#146;s economic and social success, we also make the case about the need to think of the alternative. If disengagement led to lower growth rates in China, think of the appalling challenges that it would pose to such a large country, with such rising aspirations and expectations among its people for a better life. After all, China comprises between one-fifth and one-sixth of the world&#146;s population, so its fortunes  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1049"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 1049</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>impact directly on all of us, not just because of the trade and consumer goods that it provides us but because China&#146;s environmental performance, its role as a consumer of the world&#146;s natural resources and its role in global security are of direct interest to us. We require a partnership and a dialogue to help China manage its way through these daunting challenges of development and modernisation in a way that improves human rights as well as its performance on the other criteria. I would certainly make the case&#151;I did not hear that much dissent from it in the debate&#151;that however one balances the disappointing human rights record against the successes in other areas, the only way forward is engagement.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="08011067000107">China&#146;s stability is vitally important both for us and for global growth more generally. President Hu is committed to doing more to address the growing disparities affecting his country, and that is a commitment we wholeheartedly welcome. It has a value in terms of China&#146;s record on economic and social rights that we sometimes underestimate. After all, there are two covenants on human rights; there is not only the civil and political covenant, but also the social and economic one. Since the reforms of 1978, China has lifted perhaps as many as 500 million people out of poverty. We need to applaud that and work to see how we can build further on it.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="08011067000108">We want China to be a stable power so that it can play an increasing role in the global political system. That is because with the role comes the responsibilities associated with being a global stakeholder, as Bob Zoellick, president of the World Bank, has described it. Through exercising its influence responsibly, China can be a real force for good from Darfur to Kosovo, Iran to North Korea, and Burma to Afghanistan. Indeed, there has been some limited&#151;I acknowledge that&#151;progress on this. For example, China is now one of the largest contributors of personnel to UN peacekeeping operations of any P5 member. Chinese engineers are working in the Middle East, as well as a battalion of engineers embarked for Darfur. More recently, China voted in favour of important UN Security Council resolutions and supported what was for it difficult statements on issues such as Darfur and Burma, and as has been said, China facilitated the visit of the UN envoy to Burma last year.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="08011067000109">Further, while I acknowledge that there are two points of view on this, China&#146;s role in Africa is nevertheless very significant. At the time of my visit to Beijing last summer, in conversation with me the envoy to Africa announced that indeed China would now limit its support to Zimbabwe to humanitarian assistance and that it recognised that it was no longer a plausible development partner. On Darfur, it has been China&#146;s pressure which, while at times perhaps it was not as strong as we would have wished, none the less allowed us last July to pass a Security Council resolution at 15 votes to zero in order to bring forward the deployment of UNAMID and see the beginnings of political negotiations between the two sides.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="08011067000110">Finally, I turn to the issue of China&#146;s investment in the infrastructure of Africa. Speaking as an old development man, while I recognise that the Chinese  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1050"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column 1050</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are like a new donor who needs to learn how the issues of environmental and social standards as well as good governance are critical to development outcomes, nevertheless for Africa, which for years was asking us for investment into the critical infrastructure of roads and power to allow it to compete in the global economy, it was China which heard that call. I regret that we in the West did not come forward with similar amounts of development assistance. So, yes, we can make the case for the ways in which the Chinese can improve how they deliver that assistance, but we should not fall into the trap of looking, in this case, an aid gift horse in the mouth.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="08011067000111">Domestically, we believe that China could do more progressively to build a stronger rule of law, much greater freedom of information and association, and, over time, we hope, a pluralistic political system. That is critical if China is to equip itself with the checks and balances needed to let the pressure out of the steam cooker of dealing with public discontent. If people are not to riot and protest then, as we have seen in country after country, they must be granted the means of expressing themselves peacefully in politics. So we will go on pressing for a trajectory of Chinese reforms that do not cover only economic and social issues, but touch also on the political. It is against that backdrop that I would like to turn to the specific human rights issues raised today. Obviously it will not be possible to deal with every case, so I shall be happy to come back to noble Lords after the debate who want more information on particular cases.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="08011067000112">First, let us acknowledge that ordinary Chinese people are now at much greater liberty to choose where they live and work and have greater rights to travel abroad. With this greater openness comes a greater exposure to other people&#146;s ideas and cultures. China&#146;s burgeoning economy offers them new choices and opportunities.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="08011067000113">Institutional progress is often ignored, but there are developments in China&#146;s legislative framework to provide greater protection for the rights of its citizens. The new labour law, which came into force on 1 January, is a good example. Of course there are difficulties of full implementation in a country the size of China, where there are still restrictions on some forms of public organisation. Nevertheless, on issue after issue, we are seeing greater recourse to legal remedies, a greater demand by the Government for improvements in how the judiciary operates and greater use by citizens of legal redress when they feel that their rights have been abused. On the rule of law, we consider that the use of house arrest, of re-education through labour and of extrajudicial forms of detention remain serious problems and we continue to urge the Chinese to be more transparent. But we also see progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="08011067000114">Freedom of the media is still a significant problem. The new media regulations, put in place in January 2007, provide greater freedom for foreign journalists to travel around the country, but they are due to expire in October, after the Olympics, and do not, as has been pointed out, apply to domestic journalists. As has been said, the BBC Mandarin service is being

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="08011067000115">We are all aware of the difficult issues around Tibet. The death penalty in China has also been mentioned and, while its use seems to be declining, we still lack sufficiently reliable data to be confident of how far the number of executions has really fallen. Freedom of religion has properly been mentioned by many noble Lords today and we share the great concern about it.</p>

<a name="80110-0016.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="08011067000116">On the one-child policy, when I heard the noble Lord refer to the fact that China is the only country where by law you cannot have a brother or sister, I thought that my squabbling children would all apply to move there. But behind the policy lies a profound and dangerous social situation. The consequences for family life and the structure of the country were by no means fully understood when the policy was adopted. I fear that we will live with the consequences for some time. Let me assure the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that moneys given to UNFPA are not used for coercive family planning; there has been much insistence by UNFPA that its moneys are used for policies that do not breach human rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="08011067000117">Specific cases were mentioned. I visited China last August and, again, I can say that the cases of Chen Guangchen and that of his wife, Yuan Weijing, who at that time had just been stopped from travelling, have been raised by me and by others. The case of the children of Rebiya Kadeer has been raised. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary discussed human rights with his Chinese counterpart during the latter&#146;s visit here in December. He again raised Chen Guangchen&#146;s case, as well as those of Gao Zhisheng

We are disappointed that the Chinese Government remain reluctant to commit to a timetable for ratification and we urge them to do so. It has been noted that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister will visit China later this month. He, too, will raise the issue of human rights and, shortly after his visit, we will hold the 16th round of the UK-China human rights dialogue, which will look in great depth at progress and at the challenges ahead. There is, as has been mentioned, a similar European Union dialogue in which we also participate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="08011067000119">In closing, I acknowledge that the Prime Minister will raise lots of other things in addition to human rights. He will raise our growing links in the financial, commercial, environmental, political, research, cultural and sporting areas. We host the Olympics in sequence with each other, and we will have a lot to learn from each other. We hope to be a kind of financial back office for China as its role in the world grows. We hope to partner with China to find solutions to its environmental difficulties. We have made great progress in that. The dialogue with China is rich and important and it must continue on all fronts, but it is critical that central to it&#151;and something that we are never embarrassed about raising&#151;is the role of human rights in China&#146;s development.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000009">The noble Lord said: We return to this Bill and all its works, having had the chance to reflect during Christmas and new year. It was helpful that last evening when I went, unusually for me, to a reception that the mutuals put on with the Building Societies Association in Portcullis House and then to a reception held by the British Bankers&#146; Association. It was useful to meet one or two people who had an interest in this Bill.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011068000010">This Amendment No. 34 brings us back to the crunch of what an account is. The amendment states that an account is,</p>
<ul><a name="08011068000397">&#147;any account maintained by a bank or building society since the inception&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000339">so there is no doubt&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08011068000398">&#147;of such a bank or building society whether or not an account is still maintained in the name of the original depositor&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000340">What we do not know is what has happened over the years. If we take a view that the banks and building societies were inaugurated some 150 or 200 years ago, the idea of dormancy and what might happen to dormant accounts has been interesting people for perhaps only 10, 15 or 20 years, but did not exercise minds in earlier times. Therefore it would not surprise me if a bank or building society in earlier times had said, &#147;Well, it looks as if these people are not going to turn up. We have had a bit of a bad year. We will write this money off to profit&#148;. Indeed, in terms of a bank, it could have been subsumed in that which has ultimately been paid as a dividend. We do not know that and I do not know whether anyone does.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08011068000011">However, it is important to make it clear that we are not talking about something that has happened only in the past year or two, but that if these sums have been built up over many years they are still in play as far as this Bill is concerned in terms of dormancy and being available for distribution in the way that is intended.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000012">Since we last met, it is interesting that Amendment No. 42, in the Minister&#146;s name, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011068000399">&#147;an account is to be treated as remaining open where it is closed otherwise than on ... instructions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000341">He is getting somewhere near to me, except that I think that my amendment is more clear and straightforward. Speaking is sometimes effective by putting these matters on record. The British Bankers&#146; Association put out a few sheets the other day on which it states that the banks have said all along that they will participate voluntarily, provided that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011068000400">&#147;the scheme was based on a definition that focused on genuinely lost monies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000342">I think that my amendment is helpful by talking about definition; but, even more helpfully, the BBA states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011068000359">&#147;It includes accounts dating back to when the financial institution first opened and includes accounts originated in banks and building societies that have since been subsumed in today&#146;s bank and building societies&#148;.</p>

I hope he recognised that he was getting a favourable response from all sides. He is right that the government amendment helps matters, as he would see it, to move a little closer to his position and, as we would see it, to make clear the provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08011068000014">The noble Lord&#146;s amendment is not necessary. I hear what he says about historical accounts. However, Clause 1 applies to historical accounts where a bank or building society transfers to an authorised reclaim fund the balance of a customer&#146;s dormant account, and it is clear that, provided the customer is able to show that he has entitlement over the account as the proper claimant, the money will be paid to him regardless of the fact that so far as concerns the institution there may have been historical issues or changes relating to the account.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08011068000015">The account may not be in the original account holder&#146;s name because of the factors identified by the noble Lord, but he is right&#151;he read out the relevant passage&#151;that the banks and building societies are participating in a voluntary scheme, and they are participating on very clear principles. The objective is to ensure that account holders are reunited as far as possible with money that is properly theirs. An account will become dormant only after the 15-year period, subject to the safeguards in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08011068000016">I recognise the noble Lord&#146;s anxieties, but I do not think that his amendment advances the cause significantly. If a financial institution has a combined historical dormant account for its own operational reasons, that does not prevent a balance owing to a customer either being reclaimed by that customer if he is able to establish entitlement or going into the scheme.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para9">

He kindly referred to Amendment No. 42, so he recognises that we are making our position clearer, but I assure him that his amendment is not necessary and would not add to the security that he seeks regarding the accuracy of the definition of dormant accounts.</p>

We have received a lot of paperwork recently, and are still receiving it, on the subject of &#147;reuniting&#148;, and it is right and proper that that reuniting endeavour takes place, but three things can happen. First, money can be reunited. Secondly, money that goes to the reclaim fund can ultimately go to a good cause. However, I am concerned with the third area, whereby money does not go to the reclaim fund because it was written off to a suspense account by the bank in 1950 or was written off to profit in 1935 or whatever. If we are talking about a level playing field, we have to be absolutely clear about what is in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08011068000019">I could understand if the Minister said that anything before 1918 or 1945 or whatever date was being written off. That is why I said in the first place that every account that has ever existed should be included. If it is really dormant and cannot be united, it should get through to the reclaim fund. I am concerned that there should not be a situation where a bank or building society says, &#147;We wrote it all off in the old days. We have had some since about 1970, but anything before that has been forgotten and we are not bothering about it&#148;. That is the problem. If there is a level playing field, there must be that clarity. That is why we need an amendment of this nature.</p>

At our last Sitting, I tabled Amendments Nos. 33 and 35 to Clause 9, which were intended to tease out the meaning of the drafting. In the event, the 7.30 pm Grand Committee curtain came down before we were able to complete our discussions and I promised the Minister that I would try to find a way of bringing back the points to continue them. Since we were in the middle of our discussions of Clause 9, I was able to continue our debate under the simple device of clause stand part.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08011068000025">I will remind the Minister what I asked on our last Committee day because that was some time ago. I first probed what was meant in subsection (1) of Clause 9 about an account which &#147;consisted only of money&#148;. I pointed out that accounts always consisted of money because that is how accounts are expressed.  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC332"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column GC332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I asked the Minister to explain what subsection (1) was intended to include or exclude and I hope that he can give some examples so that the Committee can be clear about what is intended.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08011068000026">Secondly, I probed why subsection (2) restricted accounts to those which are part of a bank's &#147;activity of accepting deposits&#148;. I asked how that applied to accounts that arrived in the bank through other financial services. I cited the specific example of a self-invested pension plan, which includes a bank account. How is a customer to know whether his account falls within subsection (2)? Again, I asked the Minister to give some examples of what is intended to be included or excluded by virtue of subsection (2) to bring the policy intent behind Clause 9 to life.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08011068000027">In Committee, the Minister replied that the Government wanted to restrict this Bill to ordinary current and deposit accounts. He said a lot of other things as well but they were not relevant to the issues that I raised. In particular, he did not respond to the questions that I raised in respect of subsections (1) and (2) and did not give any examples to clarify why, if the Government intended to restrict this Bill to current and deposit accounts, the Bill does not simply say that it should be so restricted, with appropriate definitions. I tabled the clause-stand-part objection to enable the Minister to reply to the points that we did not fully get a chance to explore in December and to gain greater enlightenment of the Government's intention behind Clause 9.</p>

I hope that I am better equipped today to respond to the points that she made. Perhaps a little refreshment on the issues after the new year is appropriate. This is a voluntary scheme; the product of the Government working with the bank and building society sector to produce a scheme based on dormant bank and building society accounts.</p>
<h5><a name="08011068000411">2.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08011068000029">The noble Baroness asked on a previous occasion in Committee, and has done so again today, why the Bill defines &#147;account&#148; as it does. There is no formal definition of &#147;account&#148; in common use. The Bill is therefore obliged to define eligible accounts and does so by insisting that they must consist of cash and must relate to the bank or building society&#146;s activity of accepting deposits. The noble Baroness asked why the &#147;accounts&#148; must consist only of cash. She is well qualified to recognise that a whole range of assets and financial products is held in accounts with banks and building societies. ISAs, for example, consist of stocks and shares, as well as cash. The Government&#146;s intention is for the dormant accounts scheme to be based only on accounts containing cash, because it is a voluntary scheme and we want to make the demands on bank and building societies as simple as possible so that we can achieve the goal that they share with us. The Bill facilitates a scheme which addresses the relevant legal and accounting issues for cash deposits. We would be obliged to make different provisions if other types of investment, such as shares, were to be transferred into the proposed reclaim fund.</p>




<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC333"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column GC333</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08011068000030">Subsection (2) restricts the scheme to accounts relating to an institution&#146;s activity of accepting deposits. This focuses the proposed scheme on ordinary current or savings accounts and excludes those from which payments are made in relation, for example, to insurance policies or mortgages obtained through the bank or the building society. The provision would include any current account opened by a bank or building society as part of its deposit-taking activities where those accounts facilitate another financial approach; for example, a self-invested personal pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08011068000031">If we were to open more widely the definition of &#147;account&#148;, we might need to take account of a whole range of fresh definitions. The Bill must define the assets caught by the scheme, because the scheme will not function unless people are clear about it. Simply removing the provisions from the Bill would not protect consumers&#151;very far from it. A definition of &#147;dormant&#148; based on customer-initiated transactions makes sense for current or savings accounts, but may not make sense for accounts opened in relation to the provision of other products such as insurance policies. We would therefore be obliged to address that problem.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08011068000032">Similarly, the definition of &#147;balance&#148; would scarcely be appropriate for describing the customer&#146;s entitlement in relation to other financial products involving investments. I recognise that the noble Baroness has a point: the Bill looks narrowly defined and with a certain degree of crudity. We are all aware of the much more sophisticated financial transactions in which ordinary members of the public are so frequently involved in these changing times. However, the scheme has to be clear. The banks and building societies must know what their operations involve. That is why we talk in terms of cash and money, and do not seek to open up the wider assets which customers might deposit with banks and which raise challenging issues. The essence of the Bill is to launch a scheme with a maximum amount of clarity and simplicity.</p>

He underlined that the Government have not chosen a direct form of drafting&#151;which is to define current and deposit accounts&#151;but an indirect form designed to ensure that the Bill does not catch anything other than bank and building society accounts. We debated that during our first day in Committee, as the Minister is aware, and most of us are dissatisfied with the scope of the Bill, but if the Minister is insistent that it should be narrowly defined, Clause 9 achieves that effect. That does not mean that we are happy with the outcome, but he has better explained the intent behind Clause 9.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="08011068000038">Amendment No. 36 adds a new subsection after Clause 10(1) which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011068000362">&#147;An account cannot be treated as dormant until the bank or building society in question has written to the holder of the account indicating the consequences for the account under this Act&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000344">As I understand it, the British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association have agreed that the <I>Banking Code</I> will in future agree text that incorporates a requirement for banks and building societies to write to account holders when they subscribe to the dormant accounts schemes and to remind account holders every three years. The code will also state that the unclaimed assets scheme will apply after 15 years. We support that, but the <I>Banking Code</I> is a voluntary code, and not all banks and building societies subscribe to it&#151;we covered that during the first two days in Committee. While the code is extremely helpful, it has no direct bearing on the definition of a dormant account for the purposes of the Bill. My amendment simply makes it clear that communication is a legal prerequisite before an account can be declared dormant and transferred to the reclaim fund.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08011068000039">My amendment thus works with the grain of the agreement of the BBA and the BSA, but makes clear in the legislation what we understand to be the intent behind their approach to the dormant accounts scheme. It would apply to all banks and building societies, whether or not they subscribe to the code or operate it properly having subscribed to it. I hope that the Minister will welcome the amendment, which is aimed at consumer protection. I beg to move.</p>

Given that we have a voluntary scheme in prospect&#151;until we can change it on Report&#151;if the BBA supports the substance of the amendment, it is difficult to see why it should not be put in the Bill to reassure everybody. There is no issue of principle in any of the actors in this saga around this, so why not put it in the Bill and be done with it?</p>

They understand the anxieties of the House that maximum steps should be taken to make customers aware of their assets and the implications of the scheme.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08011068000043">In real terms, account holders will not feel any difference from this legislation with regard to their accounts. They are active in pursuing their interests with regard to their accounts; the only time when they are affected is if an account is defined as dormant. We hope that the cases when reclaim occurs will be few and far between; that is the purpose of the publicity that the banks are undertaking.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000044">The parts of the scheme dealing with reunification and customer notification are not a matter for the Government or for legislation, but I assure the Committee that the Government were at pains to emphasise to the interests concerned that such a scheme would not work to public satisfaction unless significant efforts were made on the process of reunion between the customer and their account, when the account has fallen into abeyance. We have had proof over the past two months of the work that has been done in this area, including later this month the launch of the one-stop shop for the customers searching for their lost accounts, which will enable them to initiate a free search covering banks, building societies and national savings via a single application.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para30">
<p><a name="08011068000045">We are satisfied that significant efforts are being made with regard to this aspect of the scheme. In keeping with the voluntary concept of the scheme, we do not propose to put in legislation demands on the institutions about how they should increase awareness. They have agreed to notify account holders generally of the scheme&#146;s introduction&#151;that is, all customers&#151;and its implications for them. When account holders are in active contact with their bank, notification will go through the existing channels, with the existing literature. If an account has been inactive for 15 years and the institution is not confident that it has the account holder&#146;s current address, it is not likely to be very productive for the bank or building society to write to an address that has produced no response for that length of time.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para31">
<p><a name="08011068000046">It is already usual practice for banks and building societies to write to customers whose accounts have been inactive over a much shorter period than the 15 years envisaged in the legislation. That is set out in the 10 pledges leaflets issued by the British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association. If the institution receives no response, the account is treated differently from other live accounts. For example, the banks and building societies no longer send statements to an address when it is clearly proving to be unproductive.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0001.htm_para32">
<p><a name="08011068000047">Therefore, a further requirement for a written notification after 15 years is likely to prove of benefit only to fraudsters engaged in identity theft. It would be burdensome on the institution, likely to produce

For that reason, the banks and building societies will instead continue their current practice of attempting to contact lost customers at a much earlier stage than 15 years and publish their policies on how they will determine their accounts eligible for the scheme at that 15 year stage.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000048">We have already had evidence of the work being done by the banks and building societies with regard to the scheme.

The Government did not want to place demands on the institutions, but that is approaching the issue from the wrong end. This is about protecting the interests of the individual account holders. As the banks and building societies say that writing to those holding accounts is something they would do routinely, it seems to me perfectly reasonable to say that that should form part of the definition.</p>

I am not convinced that it is a sufficient answer, although clearly there is a risk to banks and building societies being required to do what they say they are going to do to ensure that account holders are informed about their account and the effect of the Act. People do not want to get into reclaim situations: they want to know that their accounts continue to exist. I do not regard the Minister&#146;s response as satisfactory. However, as this and a number of other amendments are probing, I will withdraw them today and will consider whether, in the light of other answers I receive, the Bill overall is satisfactory in this regard.

No-mail accounts and fixed-term accounts which have not reached their maturity date are excluded from the definition. That is because the aim is to cover accounts that are genuinely dormant. It is difficult to know whether in those two instances customers have forgotten about their accounts or not.</p>

It would seem, therefore, that he is content for the bank or building society to contact account holders. If that is the case, unlike no-mail accounts, which are excluded, institutions would be able to use their usual processes to contact the account holder to establish dormancy. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000061">The current definition excludes fixed-term accounts, not to be used on a regular basis, and no-mail accounts where it can be difficult for an institution to establish dormancy.

If she had such bank accounts in her name, would the banks under this definition be able to treat them as dormant? I suspect that they could. If she was not able to instruct any transactions within the terms of subsection (1)&#151;and I rather doubt she would have instructed the bank not to communicate within the terms of subsection (2)&#151;technically there is the potential for dormancy to arise.

My experience is that the banks increasingly feel unable to exercise discretion and are bound by rigid rules for fear of litigation of various kinds. The obvious example is that as a result of the money-laundering regulations, even where you are a customer of the bank and the bank knows everything it can about your circumstances, if you wish to change accounts or add your signature to another account at the same bank, you have to go through the same procedure as if you were a complete stranger.</p>

That is what the Bill is all about. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, for giving a fascinating illustration of a potential bank account. On the blessed day when Aung San Suu Kyi becomes free, it would be a pretty dim bank that was not able to respond to her claims upon resources which she might have lodged in the United Kingdom. </p>

<a name="80110-gc0002.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08011068000072">Let us remember where we are starting from: these are the minimum bases for an account being dormant; the bank is involved in judgment on other matters.

It is quite clear from the <I>B</I><I>anking </I><I>C</I><I>ode</I><I></I>that banks will err on the side of protecting the customer&#151;that is their obligation&#151;and the account holder still has the right to claim even when a transfer to the reclaim fund has occurred.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000073">I hope I have been able to respond positively enough to this probing amendment to reassure the noble Baroness. At the root of this and other anxieties about how far we should go on definitions, the concept behind the Bill is not to impose the money-laundering regulatory definitions to which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, referred; this is an attempt to get the co-operation of the banking and building society institutions in a flexible scheme with the minimum amount of statutory constraint.</p>

Members of the Committee may think that that sounds fanciful, that if they reflect on the strange way in which families sometimes behave, they will see that it has a ring of truth. The joint account that was described to me is held in the name of two people who are related but who for deep and inscrutable family reasons do not communicate with each other. One of the family members absolutely refuses to discuss any transactions on the account and so the money sits there, as it has done for many years, accumulating interest, but being put to no other purpose.</p>

This is another interesting illustration, which I will probably need to reflect on, as will my officials. However, she will recognise that banks are not totally unfamiliar with the complexities that can arise from joint accounts, some of which need multiple signatures. A submission by an individual who is a joint account holder may not as defined in the Bill protect the account from going into dormancy, but it is a relevant transaction. If an account holder writes to the bank, it is certainly a communication with the bank that falls outside the definition of dormancy for which we are searching, which is the bank having an understanding that there is no person with interest&#151;I am using interest in the general sense&#151;in the account at all.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000097">I emphasise to the noble Baroness that I can see how complex things can become, but the claim upon the moneys in the account still obtains, even if the resources go to the reclaim fund.

<p><a name="08011068000098">I recognise the issue that the noble Baroness raised, but if we tried to cover every eventuality in the definition of dormancy&#151;we have been fairly productive this afternoon, but I have not the slightest doubt that many other illustrations could be brought to our attention&#151;the Bill would have very extensive categorisations about dormancy. We think that because dormancy merely relates to the transfer of resources, not the ending of entitlement, we can defend the definition in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000100">The Minister&#146;s fallback is that they can get their money back in due course. I do not think that is an adequate answer because people do not want to see their moneys temporarily confiscated so that they have to go through the reclaim procedure for accounts that they know about. What is missing from the Bill is something that would go beyond this rule base because, as we explored earlier, it does not require the banks to take account of other knowledge, which could come in a number of different ways, that puts them on notice that the account is not regarded by the account holder, or somebody who could be the account holder, as dormant. What will happen is that computer programs will be written to sweep all these accounts into the reclaim fund. There will not be individual judgments on individual accounts; a series of algorithms will produce the answer. Individuals who have spoken to me are rather aggrieved that an algorithm could sweep an account that has not been touched for a number of years for the reasons that I explained into the reclaim fund. The current definition is flawed to the extent that it will allow an algorithm approach without requiring the bank to take account of knowledge of any other facts. I may well want to return to this issue at the next stage, unless the Minister wants to say anything else at this stage.</p>

They are minimalist definitions. The bank can follow its normal procedures for reaching a judgment on whether an account is dormant in the circumstances that the noble Baroness identified. She said that if the other person survived or relented on his obduracy in his obstruction of the account and sought to activate it, it might take some time to reclaim it from the fund. By definition, time has already elapsed, otherwise the abuse would not be as the noble Baroness defined it, with two account holders who cannot agree to activate an account at any stage. I take it that that is not meant to happen over a very short period of time but over a considerable period of time.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08011068000102">Secondly, I maintain again that the banks can take this matter into account if the other joint account holder makes a submission to the bank. I know that that does not fall within the law. We have not tried to construct the law with a precise, exclusive definition of dormancy because, if we sought to do so, we would have a Bill as long as some of our greatest pieces of legislation. The banks are intending to operate this scheme in a manner consistent with the <I>B</I><I>anking </I><I>C</I><I>ode</I>, under which they are used to having to exercise judgment on issues of flexibility. The noble Baroness gave the example of a joint account holder making a submission and illustrating why he could not get access to the account or effect it in any way, shape or form, although he had an interest in it, but it would be a very odd banking judgment if that was regarded as not being a declaration of activity.</p>

On the whole, I do not believe that people would want their accounts to be swept into the reclaim fund, as that would push them into a reuniting situation. As we discussed during our previous day in Committee, the reclaim fund may well run out of money for various reasons and it will probably have a lower covenant value than the major commercial banks. Therefore, there is no reason why an account holder should be forced to have his money temporarily confiscated through this legislation, which is drafted from the perspective of the banks rather than that of account holders. As I said, we will return to this matter on Report but, for today, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The assets&#151;the money represented by the accounts&#151;are owned by the account holders, but the Bill does not allow an account holder to say that he does not want his money to be swept into the reclaim fund for onward transmission to the Big Lottery Fund. It seems to me that it is a very basic property right for an account holder to say that he does not want his account to be part of this scheme.</p>

There will be others who simply will not like the idea that the banks can hand over their accounts to someone over whom they have no control or influence.

If the banks and building societies went down that route they would unwind the consensus on which this Bill is apparently built and would deserve whatever government action was decided to be taken in response. But I do not believe that, in practice, banks would seek to exploit an exemption of that nature, as provided for by my amendment.

It has much the same purpose as Amendment No. 37 that I withdrew, but provides much more comprehensive protection to the account holder as well as being more neatly drafted. This amendment is much easier to comprehend for anyone studying the Act. It is particularly important that we should pursue this, because on closer reading government Amendment No. 42 does not provide the degree of protection that I had first imagined and I apologise for having eulogised so much an hour ago. I know that the noble Baroness says that this is a probing amendment, but I hope that at the next stage it will be a non-probing amendment to be pursued with the utmost vigour&#151;unless, of course, the Minister sees fit to accept its obvious merits today and save us all a great deal of trouble.</p>

Let me emphasise that I would have thought that the fact that the specification that this account was to be defined as non-dormant was something that the bank would take into account. We are indicating that in a number of other areas the bank is motivated by the scheme to seek to ensure that assets are reclaimed by the holders. If a bank receives a straightforward instruction that an account is not to be directed towards the dormant category and taken into the reclaim fund, it is obviously part of banking practice. If that action were taken after the account had been opened, I cannot think of anything that is likely to render the bank more liable to criticism than the straightforward instruction that, even in 15 years&#146; time or beyond, the account is to be defined as non-dormant. There has been an instruction to the bank.</p>

For example, if a bank account holder says, &#147;I don&#146;t want to be part of this scheme&#148;, he should not be. I am glad that the Minister agreed with that but it is not what the Bill says.

However, this is a voluntary scheme. The banks and building societies have given pledges about how they intend it to operate and they have been clear about how they intend to treat dormant accounts. Not being able to contact an account holder can be an indication of dormancy.

First, as I said to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, we are seeking to make sure that there are no undue obstructions on resources being made available to the scheme through the technical operations of banks. That is the purpose of the amendment. In response to the noble Baroness, the issue that I addressed was: if the account was transferred into the reclaim fund and the claimant appeared with a properly attested claim after the money was gone, of course the available resources would include the account and proper interest that might have accrued. It looks as if I am not answering the noble Baroness&#146;s direct question, so I will draw a line and give her a chance to press me further.</p>

The noble Lord has put himself in the skin of the charities&#151;the good causes&#151;and wants to make sure that the maximum amount under the terms of the Bill gets into the reclaim fund and moves on via the Big Lottery Fund and so on. This definition makes sure that if an account is not technically closed, it can still be treated as a dormant account. What the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, asked in his important intervention was whether there was a distinction between an account that was closed and put in suspense, which is a conventional way of coming out of the active treatment of an account, and accounts that have been treated as extinct in an accounting sense, transferred out of suspense and sort of lost sight of in today&#146;s accounting records. You could not look at those records and see the account because, in the past, it was transferred to profit. I think that the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, was: are we going to get those accounts or not as part of the reclaim fund activity?</p>

We are talking about the identification of the account; what has happened to the money is secondary, even if it has been paid out in profits and dividends, it can still be hauled back again. There can be a contra item to transfer it back. Are we saying that the accounts have effectively been written off and the name has gone, the money has been transferred and that there is no way in which to identify the account on future? If that is the case, the holder is never going to see that money again.</p>

I am trying to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on this: we are not seeing this money swallowed&#151;which is the anxiety expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, too. Such accounts are eligible for the scheme and the money goes into the scheme, and the recipients at the other end&#151;and this is the first time this afternoon that we have addressed such individuals or organisations&#151;will be the beneficiaries of these resources, because they will be within the scheme. But in response to the anxiety about the definition of dormancy, which we have discussed for the past hour or so, I can say that there is potential for a claim from the original depositor or their successors, if it can be attested to subsequently.</p>

Let us assume that one of our great-great-grandfathers opened an account in 1850 and that he put in &#163;100. I do not believe that if you go back to that bank or building society and say that you are the great-great-grandson, it is going to say, &#147;Ah, yes&#151;we&#146;ve got it in the old ledger, in the safe&#148;. I believe that some time between 1850 and now it has either gone to profit or suspense. The point is whether that money is going to get to the good causes&#151;because it is clear that it will not get anywhere else. It will stay with the bank unless it gets to the good causes, as I do not believe that after all this time anyone is going to knock on the door for the money.</p>

If the noble Lord talks about historical records in those terms, I will have difficulty in responding to him. He will recognise that what is being transferred into this scheme are accounts that have been extant but have not been active over the past 15 years. If he is asking whether banks are going back into their historical records since their foundation, I think that that would be a somewhat unreasonable request. The banks are addressing themselves to those accounts that are extant with them and which have not been activated over the past 15 years. Those resources are going into the scheme. I shall have to write to the noble Lord about how far banks are going to go back into their historical records on claims, but it is obvious that if there is a claim on a bank, it can always be sustained as long as the law will establish that. Nineteenth century money is as eligible for the scheme as 20th or, in 15 years&#146; time, 21st century money. As the noble Lord is not acting as the claimant but on behalf of the potential recipients, I can give him the positive answer that the scheme will benefit from all such resources.</p>

As we have argued for a good part of this afternoon, the Government&#146;s perspective is that the framework of the scheme must have the minimum of prescription.

<p><a name="08011068000152">The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 44 seeks to add another power for the Treasury in relation to the Clause 10 definitions of &#147;dormancy&#148;. It would allow the Treasury to reduce the period of inactivity, if I can use that shorthand, before which an account can be treated as dormant, which is currently set at 15 years in Clause 10(1). The order referred to in the amendment would be subject to the affirmative procedure because it would represent a significant change to the scheme set out in the Bill and would need to be given proper scrutiny in Parliament.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0004.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011068000153">The Treasury Select Committee in another place considered this issue in some detail and concluded that the period should be 10 years. It is difficult to be sure whether 15 years or 10 years is the right period, but a period of operating the scheme would allow more information to be gathered about the impact of time on dormancy. Of the other countries that have a dormant account scheme, only Ireland uses a period as long as 15 years. The Select Committee pointed out that that is an incomplete comparator because of the narrow definition used in Ireland. Switzerland uses 10 years; Australia, 7 years; New Zealand, 6 years; and US states use between 3 and 5 years. So there is clearly no magic in 15 years.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0004.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08011068000154">The UK evidence to the Select Committee was mixed. The Building Societies Association regards accounts as &#147;lost&#148; after three years and for internal purposes the Select Committee was told that banks use around six years. But the British Bankers&#146; Association said in its evidence to the committee that 15 years should be used because at that point,</p>
<ul><a name="08011068000405">&#147;it can be concluded with reasonable certainty that we have passed an 80/20 threshold in terms of lost monies expected to be reclaimed&#148;.</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011068000376">&#147;As you move down the maturity scale, you rapidly reach the point at which transfers from the balance sheet would be accompanied by a shift in the lost/reclaim ratio towards 50/50% and beyond&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000350">I believe this means that, at present, after 15 years only 20 per cent of accounts are likely to be reclaimed, while at 10 years the likelihood is that 50 per cent will be. I have no reason to doubt the BBA&#146;s analysis at present, but there is no reason to believe that those relationships would hold true over time. Indeed, as greater efforts are made to make customers aware of the existence of their accounts in accordance with the <I>Banking Code</I>, it may be that the 80:20 ratio is reached earlier. Greater opportunities for reuniting, via the facilities that are now available and still being developed, will also tend to shift the curve.</p>

Fifteen years is not an unreasonable point at which to start, because as the BBA and the noble Baroness have said, one does not want to get to the point where one is transferring a large amount of money to the reclaim fund and a large proportion of it is coming back. That makes unnecessary work and effort, and almost brings the scheme into disrepute. If starting off at 10 years meant that 50 per cent of the money that went into the reclaim fund was being withdrawn, that would be unsatisfactory. The BBA suggests that 15 years will take us towards the 80:20 split, which seems a sensible target, but, as the noble Baroness said, we cannot be sure, and other countries clearly manage with a significantly shorter period than 15 years. The proposal in the amendment initially to stick with 15 years, see how it works and then change it if we find that we can beneficially do so seems to be a sensible way forward.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, kindly argued my case by representing the two positions in respect of 10 years and 15 years. She was right that the Select Committee was presented with figures by the British Bankers&#146; Association which showed that 80 per cent of the accounts are generally lost and not reclaimed&#151;20 per cent might still be so. Our judgment on the basis of that is that more resources become available to the scheme the fewer the reclaim cases that have to be handled, for the obvious reason that the costs involved in that exercise are just a straight loss to the scheme. One cannot of course argue with certainty about the change between 15 years and 10 years, but it seems reasonable to judge that, after 10 years, many more accounts would be subject to reclaim, with all the costs involved. Our concern is to ensure that the greatest amount of resources is devoted not to dealing with reclaim and the costs involved in that area, but to the scheme.</p>

That is why the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment. We do not think that the shorter definition would generate more assets for distribution in the long term. That is why the 15-year period is in the Bill.</p>

I do not think that the committee carried out any independent analysis of the impact of maturity or lapse of time on dormancy. However, that was not my point. It is not fruitful to get into the question whether 15 years is better than 10 years&#151;we will accept the judgment that 15 years is right for now. </p>

<p><a name="08011068000160">The point of the amendment was that over time we can reasonably anticipate that the conclusion that 15 years was the right figure would not necessarily hold over time. It is entirely plausible, for the reasons that I outlined earlier, that that figure might come down. The British Bankers&#146; Association did not portray it as one of the universal truths of banking that it existed for all time or was likely to do so; it merely presented it as a figure based on current circumstances. The point of the amendment is to allow for flexibility to be built in so that the reclaim fund, which will have access to all this information and be able to track patterns of reuniting&#151;because that information will not just be held in the banks&#151;will be able to advise the Treasury on those patterns.

<p><a name="08011068000173">There should be no need for the confidential customer information to be transferred routinely to the reclaim fund. The Government recognise that there may be exceptional circumstances in which a customer is unable to seek repayment from their bank or building society and the claim may need to be handled directly by the reclaim fund, which would then require access to information. Nevertheless, it is envisaged that this would operate only where claims need to be properly verified in order to enable the reclaim fund to fulfil its function to repay the customer. The amendment would enable a bank or building society to share with the reclaim fund confidential information that is not directly related to customer repayments. We do not think that is necessary. We do not foresee circumstances, apart from those I have identified, where the reclaim fund may require confidential information. We want as far as possible to restrict the flow of information to just that consideration. I hope the noble Baroness will recognise our concerns in this respect.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000179">The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 46 takes us out of the detail about how the dormant accounts scheme will operate into slightly wider territory. It inserts a new clause after Clause 12 and gives power to the Information Commissioner to assess any aspects of the way in which the reclaim fund holds, uses, discloses or shares information. The reclaim fund will be subject to the Data Protection Act, but the powers of the Information Commissioner under that Act are severely limited. We have debated this topic in the context of other Bills over the past year, notably the Statistics and Registration Service Bill and the Serious Crime Bill. In each instance, the Government resisted amendments to give the Information Commissioner further powers which, in the light of recent developments in the way in which Government bodies have been handling personal data, might not have looked the right approach. That is why I am pursuing this issue again.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08011068000180">Under Section 57 of the Data Protection Act 1998, the Information Commissioner can assess the processing of personal data if, and only if, the data controller consents to the assessment. Otherwise his powers are limited to cases where a request comes from the person affected by the processing of the personal data. It will too often be the case that individuals are unaware of the correct processing of their data. Under EU law, the Information Commissioner should be able to initiate his own investigations, but the Data Protection Act does not give him that power. The reclaim fund may hold personal information about large numbers of individuals. While the banks will act as agents of the reclaim fund when claims for repayments are made, it would be surprising if the reclaim fund had no personal information because it could not function without it, if only to deal with appeals and other matters. We have seen from the recent cases at HMRC

So there is a risk that organisations cannot be fully trusted. The Government have announced some changes to the Information Commissioner&#146;s powers, certainly in relation to government departments, although it is not clear how the broader case of the Information Commissioner&#146;s powers will develop. We have heard from some interested parties who are in touch with the Ministry of Justice that the prospects for real reform outside the narrow area of spot checks of government departments are not encouraging.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0005.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08011068000181">The Information Commissioner himself made it clear to the Justice Committee in another place that he wants significant new powers and duties. We have an opportunity in the Bill to make a modest start. Unfortunately, the scope of the Bill would not allow us to draft it for all the banks handling personal information relating to dormant accounts, but we can at least attach it to the reclaim fund, so I seek to take this modest legislative opportunity to improve the Information Commissioner's powers in ways that have been demonstrated over recent weeks to be absolutely necessary.

The amendment would go further than the Data Protection Act 1998 to allow the Information Commissioner to exercise powers in relation to any information held by the reclaim fund, and not only personal data. Of course, the role of the Information Commissioner and the whole question of data protection has been an issue of lively public interest in recent months. As the Committee will be aware, the Prime Minister announced on 21 November that the Government would give the Information Commissioner the power to carry out spot-check inspections of government departments. Further, he asked Richard Thomas and Dr Mark Walport, as part of their review, to look at the Information Commissioner's powers of assessment to see whether there was scope for extending them.</p>

In moving Amendment No. 47, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 in this group. The amendments home in on Clause 13, which deals with disclosure in directors&#146; reports. The clause is narrowly drawn so that it applies only to the disclosure by banks if they are taking part in a Clause 2 scheme&#151;it will apply only to those banks with balance sheets below &#163;7 billion which have chosen to take part in the alternative distribution scheme.</p>

In relation to information released by the reclaim fund under Schedule 1, I have already said that transparency should be an important element of this scheme. In that instance, I

<p><a name="08011068000193">I have not yet drafted an amendment which requires large building societies to make disclosures comparable to those in Amendment No. 47. That was an omission on my part.

There are several reasons for believing that it makes sense for the public to be able to see how much money individual banks and building societies are passing across to the reclaim fund. First, as we were discussing earlier, in theory the banks will go back into the mists of time to identify orphaned and unclaimed assets to include in the scheme. If one bank is successful and assiduous in doing that and another bank is lax, a figure will help to draw that out. Equally, if one bank spends a lot of time and effort reuniting customers with their money and therefore pays across less to the reclaim scheme, that will also be apparent from having this kind of information available. The ability to compare the performance of banks and building societies via this information being in the public domain could be a good and effective way of putting pressure on them to use maximum efforts to reunite people with their money and to ensure that they are putting into the scheme all suitable assets.</p>

We agree that information on how much banks and building societies transfer to the reclaim fund under Clause 1 should be disclosed and that building societies participating in the option for smaller institutions should be required to include in their annual reports the details of charities to which they have transferred dormant account money. We do not consider the amendments necessary, however. Under the provisions made by Schedule 1, the reclaim fund itself will publish information on how much money it receives from each individual institution, whether it is a large bank or a large building society.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000197">The comparison&#151;the competition as the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, described it&#151;will be found in looking at what the reclaim fund publishes as information. It will be collected as a single source by the reclaim fund and we believe that that is the most transparent way of ensuring that people can access it and make comparisons. We do not feel that it is necessary to add to the Bill the provision for large banks&#151;or even large building societies, should there be a forthcoming amendment at some future date.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000198">The disclosure requirement in relation to small, locally based building societies participating in the scheme can already be imposed and will be imposed by the Treasury through an amendment to the relevant building society account regulations. I understand that the general principle is that when a regulation-making power exists, as it does for building societies, under which the relevant provisions can be made, it is normal practice for that power to be used rather than making new provision in primary legislation. That is why, as far as smaller building societies are concerned, Amendment No. 49 is not necessary because we will do what it proposes under regulation.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0005.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08011068000199">The Treasury intends to amend the relevant regulations dealing with building society accounts and reports that are made under the Building Societies Act 1997. Therefore, we do not believe that the amendments are necessary. I can see that the next question will be why the Bill includes provision imposing disclosure requirements for smaller banks as opposed to smaller building societies. That is because the relevant regulation-making powers lie with the Secretary of State under the Companies Act 2006, rather than being exercised by the Treasury. It was thought that, on balance, it would be better to include in the Bill a position for small banks, but I am telling the Committee that small building societies will be covered by regulation.</p>

If you compared one set of accounts for one year with another, you could see whether charitable contributions had been cut as contributions to the reclaim fund went up. If the reclaim fund is to publish this information, will it be done in the form of a league table? We are talking about percentages rather than bald figures, because the contribution to the reclaim fund vis- -vis the total number of assets that that bank or building society manages is the relevant figure.

It can be summed up by saying that the Treasury does not trust any other department to use statutory instrument powers properly so it will include them in its legislation. It is rather incongruous for the Treasury to use its powers but for another bit of government not to be trusted. That does not say much for joined-up government.

I do not think that it is an either/or situation where either the reclaim fund or the banks are disclosing; there is a perfectly legitimate case for both to disclose. When we debated the requirement in Schedule 1 for the reclaim fund to disclose amounts, the Government resisted, on entirely spurious grounds of administrative complexity, the requirement for the reclaim fund to say which banks had not contributed to the reclaim fund and which had not transferred  any money to the reclaim fund under the terms of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000204">It is entirely legitimate for us to look to the banks to make disclosures about how much they have paid, and whether or not they have paid, because there is a focus on a bank when it produces its annual report and accounts. My noble friend Lord Hamilton referred to the comparison that can rightly be made between the amounts that the banks devote to charitable funds and activities, which are required to be disclosed, and the amounts transferred to the reclaim fund because there may well be trends which do not reflect well on the banks over time. We hope that will not be the case, but at least it is the right place for that disclosure to be made.</p>

As the Bill is drafted, the reclaim fund has only partial transparency and the complementary bank-specific disclosure still remains an entirely valid and appropriate way for banks to disclose their participation in this voluntary scheme. If it were a compulsory scheme, I would not be suggesting this because there would be mechanisms to ensure that the right amounts were being transferred. However, because it is a voluntary scheme, we want transparency to act as an underpinning to voluntarism. We are seeking transparency and I am disappointed with the Minister&#146;s response.

<p><a name="08011068000215">The experience of schemes outside the UK is that large sums are available. Let us judge the scheme on how well it does. Hence, the report required by this amendment focuses on the amounts that have been released and those that still could be released, as well as on the arrangements for reuniting and reclaiming. I do not believe that that will impose onerous requirements on the Treasury, as it should be monitoring these matters in any event.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000216">A published report, as required by my amendment, will allow an opportunity for public debate about the way forward if improvements are required. It might show that the scheme is a rip-roaring success and that nothing needs to be changed. That would be a cause of great celebration. However, I am sure that the Treasury would then be very eager to get the good news out. If there are matters that need to be improved to maximise the potential of the scheme or minimise the unintended consequences of the way in which the scheme has been set up, that too should have public focus. I hope that the Minister will see that the amendment is intended to help to focus on the ongoing operation of the scheme. I beg to move.</p>

The legislation enables a voluntary dormant account scheme for the participating institutions to be set up. The responsibility for managing those assets will lie with a reclaim fund run by the private sector. The scheme will be highly transparent; the fund will publish the amount of money that flows into the scheme, so it will be public knowledge. It will publish the amount that is repaid to consumers, so it will also be made public. Reuniting customers with their accounts will be the responsibility of the bank and building society sector, which is committed to supporting the scheme

Nor are we proposing to publish information about the reuniting work that the sector has pledged to do. We think it sensible that responsibility for that and for work to improve those arrangements lies with the banking sector. I know that that is not an answer that will appeal to those who supported the amendment, but it is important that the reclaim fund and the banking sector in their respective ways look after their own responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08011068000234">The logic of the Government&#146;s approach, with them having said that it is a voluntary scheme and accepted that it is money that the banking sector holds, is to say to the banking sector, &#147;We agree that this is a voluntary scheme. You will voluntarily put the money into the reclaim fund and, then, as it is money from you, why don&#146;t you decide how you are going to spend it? You can spend it along the lines that you currently spend funds in your charitable activities and, in respect of the some of the building societies, that will happen anyway&#148;. There would have been logic in that, and we would have had a much shorter Bill.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011068000235">As Ministers are aware, we on these Benches have from the start suggested that the scheme should not be voluntary, but statutory, and should cover all banks and building societies. Therefore, the logic is that we want to have a say in how the money is spent. We are, as it happens, being given that chance, because the Government want the best of both worlds: they want the banks to sort out the difficult issues around raising the money and administering it, but they want to get the benefit of how it is spent. I am sure that we can imagine the Prime Minister joyously opening a series of youth clubs up and down the country that have been funded from this scheme.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000236">The two amendments in this group seek to tease out the Government&#146;s priorities about how the money will be spent. Although, to a certain extent, it is prescriptive, to another extent it is pretty unclear. Clause 15(1), for example, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011068000406">&#147;the Big Lottery Fund shall distribute dormant account money for meeting expenditure that has a social or environmental purpose&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000351">Yet, in Clause 17, which deals with how the money will be spent, no environmental purpose is included.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08011068000237">Turning to my second amendment in this group, in Clause 17 we also see the interesting insertion of the word &#147;or&#148; between paragraphs (a) and (b) and paragraph (c) in subsection (1) which define the three different areas in which it is proposed that the money should be spent. To a casual reader, that would mean that the money was either to be spent on youth provision and financial literacy or that it was to be made available to a social investment wholesaler. I suspect that that is not what the Government mean at all. I think that they mean that it will be distributed to a combination of those three channels. However, we would welcome some clarification from Ministers as  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC368"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column GC368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to why the word &#147;or&#148; appears there and whether what they have in mind is a simplistic reading of the Bill whereby the money will be distributed to one or the other.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08011068000238">I should also welcome Ministers&#146; views on an expansion of the point that I have just raised. What are their priorities regarding the three strands, assuming that they mean that the three strands should all receive a degree of funding? Do they have it in mind to divvy up the money three ways equally or do they intend to divide it in another way? Of course, how the money is spent may depend on how much money there is. This will be the subject of debate when we come to a later amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, in which he says that a social investment wholesaler must take priority by being given the first &#163;250 million of the scheme. However, taking the figures produced by the BBA, we may well find that only &#163;250 million is available in total, and in that case priorities will presumably be rather different than if &#163;2 billion were available. Therefore, it would be useful to know whether the Government agree with the estimate of the amount of money that will be available.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08011068000239">The next question, which we will be debating in later amendments, is how the money can best be used. By that, I mean where the money can have most effect. It seems to me that, although we have accepted from the start that all these three strands are very important and that they are, quite properly, areas which might benefit from the fund, on closer examination the third area is the one where the money can have the biggest impact, not least because there are already so many other programmes which help young people and help financial literacy and financial information. For example, in December I was intrigued to see that the Government produced their financial inclusion action plan, which proposes that &#163;130 million should be spent on access to financial services and financial literacy over the period 2008-11. However, it seems to me that the need in relation to the social investment wholesaler and the fund&#146;s ability to have an impact are arguably greater than elsewhere. All those involved in the social investment movement believe that a government commitment to a social investment wholesaler would generate significant funds from elsewhere, which is unlikely to be the case under the other two strands. There is also now a pent-up demand in the social enterprise sector for funding, and increased support across all parties&#151;and certainly within government&#151;for social entrepreneurs to play a bigger part across the whole raft of activity, not least in the provision of public services.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000240">At the beginning of the week I was privileged to be present at a reception held by the All-Party Social Enterprise Group. This was attended by social entrepreneur ambassadors from across the country who had been identified by the Social Enterprise Coalition, and during the course of the evening I was able to talk to them about what they were doing. Like many Members of the Committee, no doubt, I go to a lot of receptions, quite a few of which are fairly dreary events, particularly at the end of the evening when one is looking at one&#146;s watch and hoping to get

<p><a name="08011068000241">I was impressed by the range of activities in which these entrepreneurs are involved. They are doing the things that we as a society want done, often in the areas of health, education and other aspects of public provision. In my view&#151;I have not had time yet to discuss this in any great detail with my colleagues, either here or in another place, although I have no reason to think that they will disagree&#151;this third strand should get priority within the Bill. I have no idea what the Government&#146;s view is at this stage. As we begin to discuss the distribution process, I hope the Minister can lay out the Government&#146;s thinking on how they see the three different elements they have identified being funded and what are going to be their priorities.

<p><a name="08011068000353">I am sure the Minister will accept that that comma is quite significant. It could mean that we will use unclaimed assets from dormant bank accounts to build new youth centres, and then we will spend a quite separate &#163;670 million on youth.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000244">I believe the &#163;670 million is spread over three years and that quite a lot of that money has already been allocated by the Government. However, the significant question is exactly how much has been allocated out of unclaimed assets for youth. I do not expect an answer now but if the Minister could find out for me for when we meet again next Tuesday I would be grateful.

<p><a name="08011068000246">My noble friend Lord Hamilton asked about youth. An announcement was made only recently by Mr Balls on how much money will be spent on youth. Was he counting on cash from some of the unclaimed assets, or was he saying that it was government spending? It certainly appeared to be spending by the Government as opposed to spending unclaimed assets, which after all are not government money. The whole point of the Bill is that money should be made available to projects to which the Government are not committed, and where government funds would not be appropriate. We will seek to clarify that matter. I hope that the Minister will make a start when he speaks.</p>

If confidence in the fund is to be built, the money needs to be used in a way which has a distinctive flavour and achieves something which will not be achieved by other means. My heart sank a little when we spoke of building youth centres. Those of us in the faith communities and the churches have been involved in work with young people for a long time. Buildings are important, and churches sometimes struggle with that, but it is the relationships and the quality of the work that are really important. We must be focused.</p>

If we are going to use the fund for young people&#151;I am very supportive of that idea&#151;we must do some careful thinking so that the way in which the fund is used is innovative.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000252">I have an extended question about the Big Lottery Fund and why it is selected as it is in Clause 15(1). At Second Reading I raised some of the management issues facing the board of the Big Lottery Fund, as it shrinks in size&#151;which it is undoubtedly bound to do because of the Olympics. It is in a state of constant flux and change, dropping some 19 programmes and starting up some 24. It is the heir to two lottery funds, one at least leaving behind it an unsatisfactory performance in the Government&#146;s view, and to a third temporary fund&#151;the Millennium Fund&#151;which ran its course, also not without leaving problems behind. It is unwise to rely on Big, which has yet to establish a track record or any clear identity in the minds of the public, in contrast to the heritage, sport and arts funds. Indeed, Big may fail in its purpose, and it is an extraordinary proposal that it should become the monopoly distributor of 90 per cent of dormant moneys.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08011068000253">Unfortunately, it is clear that the Government wish to control as much of the third sector as they can, which is surely out of order in this instance. As it is set out in the Bill, private moneys are to be exclusively distributed by a public sector body that is closely controlled to deliver a social engineering agenda. Its approach to additionality is defined by saying,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011068000408">&#147;Lottery funding is distinct from Government expenditure and adds value. Although it does not substitute for Exchequer funding, where appropriate it complements Government and other programmes, policies and funding&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011068000354">In other parts of the document it is absolutely clear that Big sees its duty as delivering government themes and outcomes.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08011068000254">Surely the choice of potential distributors needs to be widened. There is no case for a Big monopoly. It is not as if there are no other older and better established institutions. To cite but one, there is the Charities Aid Foundation. Nor would it be difficult to find other candidates to come forward and gain the Secretary of State&#146;s support to be nominated as distributors.</p>

We have certainly changed gear; it always adds a certain liveliness to proceedings when we discuss spending. We shall discuss these issues for a little while yet.

I say &#147;dreaded&#148; because for those noble Lords who were not present when we discussed the lottery several years ago&#151;and I exclude the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, who was present at the debates&#151;we had endless discussions on the issue of additionality.

It is very important that we should, which is why we propose to set up the machinery in this way to guarantee that. Those are the principles under which the Big Lottery Fund has been obliged to operate since its inauguration under the lottery legislation.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08011068000259">The second point that the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, raised was about how much we are going to spend. We are pretty vague on how much we are going to get in, and particularly before the end of 2009. The Committee will recall that at Second Reading we had a range of estimates about how much might be made available. I cannot give the noble Lord the figures, but I can assure him that they are quite separate from the &#163;670 million to which the Prime Minister referred.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para27">
<p><a name="08011068000260">The right reverend Prelate made quite clear that we need a process of expenditure, on youth facilities in particular, that has imagination, enterprise and locality. There is a range of potential solutions to problems, some of which are idiosyncratic, but others are more general. Nevertheless, problems are addressed differently in different localities. I heard what the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, said about the Big Lottery Fund. He was eloquent during the processes that established it, and I know he has scrutinised its operations closely. I hope I shall allay some of his greater anxieties on that score, and I shall come to that in a moment.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para28">
<p><a name="08011068000261">However, he will recognise that an advantage of the Big Lottery Fund as a distributor is that it meets the right reverend Prelate&#146;s concern that the distributor should be seen to be active in every nook and cranny of our country and in all the component parts of the United Kingdom. There are very few organisations that have that range and capacity. That is why we identified the Big Lottery Fund as the appropriate distributor. It could not have carried out the work that it has done over recent years without being subject to criticism. One cannot be involved in the distribution of the kind of resources it commands without critics&#151;not least those who, disappointed by the decisions, are, by definition, critics&#151;because they rightly hold their causes dear. There always will be criticism of and challenges to the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para29">
<p><a name="08011068000262">I want to emphasise to the Committee that the choice of the Big Lottery Fund is directed towards the effectiveness with which we can reach right across the country. It has headquarters in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and a great deal of devolved regional representation.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000263">Over this period of time it has also gained extensive experience of the third sector and public sector delivery partners, ranging from large-scale national charities through to local grass roots community groups. I take on board the point made by the right reverend Prelate on how we serve the youth of the nation. I do not think that anyone would gainsay that it is an enormous challenge for everyone in the community. It will need local and selective understanding of the problems and the allocation of resources accordingly.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0006.htm_para31">
<p><a name="08011068000264">On social and environmental purposes, we have identified youth services and increasing financial capability as priorities. In this day and age, we are all shocked when we see the level of financial illiteracy in circumstances where a great many clear and key family decisions depend upon an understanding of how to manage budgets and, where appropriate, savings. We are aware that this has not been a feature of British education in past years. Changes are now affecting education and, although our children are getting greater access to such education, we have an adult population which has in the past had limited exposure to these issues. So there is a great deal to be done there. The third issue is that of social investment in environmental objectives.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000265">At this stage, I am not able to give the reassurance that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, seeks. I am not sure there is anyone, either in government or on the planet, who would totally reassure him about the effectiveness of the Big Lottery Fund. However, it is a significant feature in the landscape, particularly for the third sector. The distribution of lottery funds is a complicated job which is subject to significant convulsions, if I can use that word in a neutral sense&#151;I am talking about the changes which have been effected in regard to the resources made available to it by recent decisions&#151;but it is difficult to identify any other organisation which could meet the necessary range of selectiveness and awareness of local situations.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000266">The effect of the second amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, would be to remove the flexibility to spend on one or more of the three areas; it would require some spending on all three areas. Spending will of course occur on all three areas over a period of time but at this stage we do not know the level of available resources. There will be a question of priorities and all we are ensuring within the framework of the Bill is maximum flexibility with regard to expenditure.

In addition, throughout our exchanges on the lottery, we invited all those who were worried about additionality to furnish the Government with a clear, legal, enforceable and operable definition of additionality.

I am no clearer than I was at the beginning about how the Government view the three purposes. I am also slightly unclear about the extent to which the Government envisage that they will, or can, direct the Big Lottery Fund in terms of making payments within the three heads. Clause 21 states that a direction may,</p>

None the less, I would have hoped, even at this stage, that the Government might be able to give a slightly more clear indication of where their priorities lie.

I am sure that the Minister will claim that the other lottery distributors are not so well placed to distribute money to organisations promoting the three favoured recipients. That is probably true; it is only the Big Lottery Fund that has such a wide remit, and, frankly, such unclear purposes that it can spend the money in a way that will complement government spending so conveniently. However, there is a later amendment in my name that will go further on additionality, on which the Minister said he had such robust views, so I shall save some of my remarks for then.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000278">Can the Minister give us an assurance that none of this money will be given by the Big Lottery Fund to projects that would or could have received lottery funding prior to the raid this year? If he cannot, will he admit that dormant accounts are essentially being used to fund the Olympics, via the circuitous route of what is meant to be an independent body&#151;the Big Lottery Fund? Of course, he cannot. Not only does the Big Lottery Fund regularly give lottery money to local authorities, publicly funded schools, NHS-funded hospitals and other responsibilities of our public sector, it will clearly continue this practice with the dormant account money. Large sections of this Bill are lifted directly from the National Lottery Act 2006. Most of Clause 15, large amounts of Clause 16 and most of Clause 21, not to mention Schedule 3, are identical and there is much more that is very similar&#151;so much for this money being entirely separate from lottery money.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0007.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08011068000279">I can think of numerous ways that the sports, arts and heritage distributor funds could spend this money in line with the Government&#146;s three concerns&#151;particularly those of young people. Does the Minister really believe that the millions of pounds taken from the sport distributors to spend on the Olympics will benefit young people more than the grassroots recipients of the money originally? I declare an interest as chairman of the National Playing Fields Association. Does the Minister not think that at least some of the dormant account money could be well spent on sport facilities and opportunities for young people? Or do the Government intend that the Big Lottery Fund should extend its remit even wider into areas that are presently served by other bodies, such as Sport England and various other sporting organisations?

Maybe we shall debate that another time. Plenty of organisations are well experienced in dealing with the issues of education and the problems

However, as a second-best solution, it is certainly a great improvement on giving Big a monopoly. The other three funds receive 16 and two-thirds of the money. That would achieve a halving of the moneys available. The other three have advantages over Big. What they are supposed to do is much clearer to the public. Everybody is pretty clear what heritage, sports and arts mean. There is no uncertainty&#151;all three have identities and, I guess, board minutes in which they dissent from some sort of message that they have received from the department. I challenge the Minister to produce a single minute of Big&#146;s board meetings in which it has dissented from the logic of the general policy directions given to it by the DCMS.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0007.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08011068000281">My point is that Big is an arm of government and we should be in no doubt of that. It does not have any realistic independence. The chairman and chief executive write a joint report and there is not a single personal note in that joint report, which is very poor governance. The chairman is supposed to be independent of the chief executive when he writes reports and put his own personal view on paper. It does not happen in Big. The other three do that because they have been established longer and are not the heirs to the mixture that Big represents. They have a personality, an identity and stand up for themselves. Therefore, if at least half the money were to go to them, it would be a great improvement on the whole lot going to Big. I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000283">These amendments would subsume the use of the unclaimed assets and resources within the general National Lottery scheme. We think that it is better, clearer, more effective and more answerable to the nation that Big should take responsibility for distribution, but with an entirely separate accounting and reporting procedure on its work with regard to these assets. That is the principle behind the Bill and we want these unclaimed assets to be entirely separate from other operations of the lottery distributors. We are insisting upon mechanisms within Big that guarantee that.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000284">The background is that these resources represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity which we need to make the most of.

I hear what the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, said in his criticisms of Big. Some of them could be voiced against anyone with the challenging position that confronts the work of Big&#151;particularly as we are still looking at a body that

Nevertheless, it is clearly the most effective body for distribution, against a background where it will, as the legislation indicates, have responsibility for a separate fund for the discrete purposes of youth services&#146; financial capability, inclusion and social investment, which will differ from other work.</p>

It gives out all the wrong signals about its work. It will work within a framework&#151;it already works within the framework of the localities that it serves. The devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will determine their own spending priorities within the general framework.

<p><a name="08011068000286">I am mindful of the fact that among Big&#146;s potential disadvantages is the diversion of funds to the 2012 Olympics, to which the noble Lord, Lord Howard, referred. As we have made clear, the Olympics is exactly the kind of objective for which the National Lottery was conceived. It is a major national project of great significance to the whole nation. I cannot think of anything that fits that definition more accurately than the Olympic Games. However, I assure the Committee that challenges to Big&#146;s decisions of allocation to the Olympics will have absolutely nothing to do with the resources that we are discussing in the framework of the Bill. Big will account for those resources entirely separately from its other operations. They will not be linked to the Olympics in any way. The dormant accounts will be managed by Big as an entirely separate and distinct fund, with separate spending areas, financial management and accounting arrangements. Schedule 3 sets out that the fund must prepare a statement of accounts and an annual report related to the distribution of dormant account money that are separate from those covering lottery resources, so that they are transparent.</p>

If we want the fund to be used comfortably for some of the innovative work that I am aware is being done among young people in places such as Brixton, it would help to deal with the issue of the name. &#147;Reawakened&#148; has certain religious tones that warm my heart, but whether it is right or not, there is some anxiety in the Committee about the word &#147;Big&#148;. In some quarters, the word &#147;lottery&#148; might raise some anxieties, so if it could be tackled, it would be a good thing.</p>

This small amendment is designed to probe a matter that the Big Lottery Fund appears to have noticed may cause some conflicts of interest. The Big Lottery Fund Second Reading brief highlighted the important issues of accountability and transparency. From what has been heard from Her Majesty&#146;s Government over the spending of the dormant accounts assets, that money will be going to similar organisations to support similar projects to those which money from the lottery currently supports and which it will continue to support.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0007.htm_para26">
<p><a name="08011068000302">The National Lottery Act 2006 made it clear that publicising how this money is spent is a matter of some importance, not only to reassure people that the money they spend goes to worthy clauses but also to ensure that people are aware that the funding for prominent and popular projects around them comes from non-governmental sources. These issues will be equally important for dormant account money. Reassuring people that their money is being well spent is slightly less important since, I hope, the banks will have taken every step possible to ensure that no one has any claim on the money, but there will still be public concern that it is not wasted. It is still important that the public do not confuse projects that are financed by the Government and projects that are financed by this scheme. How does the Minister

The Big Lottery Fund quite rightly sees it as necessary to keep the identification completely separate, but how will that be done? I hope the Minister will be able to come forward with some ideas on this matter. It is of great concern to many people, not least my noble friend Lord Hamilton of Epsom, that this money is spent in a way that will produce the most long-term benefit. A most effective safeguard against money being frittered away would be more rigorous public scrutiny of the projects the Government and the Big Lottery Fund consider it should be spent on.</p>

I asked him how much and he said, &#147;We think about &#163;1,500&#148;. It is not difficult to breathe in north Yorkshire and there is plenty of space, but the particular space concerned is a plot of land that were the foundations&#151;and there were very few of them&#151;of a 1920s village hall made of wood and corrugated iron, which became unsafe. The right reverend Prelate will be pleased to hear that we are using the church instead of the village hall because the church is not fully used the whole time.</p>

By my calculation, if that had been given to me to make into a vegetable garden, I could probably have done it in about 100 hours if I were about 20 years younger than I am&#151;and I will bet that about 100 hours are spent assessing whether to give us a grant of &#163;1,500 for a wild flower garden that within two years would otherwise be invaded by nettles.

You can do with it what you will, as the Minister told us earlier. We have had those fights and they are not important; the important thing was to have the Big Lottery Fund in the Government&#146;s hand so that from time to time they could change what it did without anybody understanding why they had come to that decision. That is why the website is so important.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000307">Ring-fencing the money from dormant bank accounts is no problem to the Big Lottery Fund. Having been the chief executive of the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which distributed money all over the third world, I am perfectly well aware of how you deal with that&#151;you just ring-fence it. But that does not mean to say that you are not doing within the ring-fenced piece exactly what you might be doing within the other piece. There is no reason why you should not do what you want, some of it here and some of it there. Transparency is argued, but my response would be that it is much more like a Kafka novel than it is like transparency.</p>

All those who have spoken in this debate have emphasised the need for that, and that is what these amendments are about.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08011068000309">Even if I had not seen who was to move Amendment No. 54, after reading it I was pretty sure that it would be the noble Lord, Lord Shutt. Who else but him could think of the title &#147;The Reawakened Fund&#148; in the context of the Bill? I express agreement, if I may, not with the name itself but with what the right reverend Prelate said&#151;as usual, his choice of words was spot on. However, we support the tenor of what the noble Lord says and how he argues his case. </p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08011068000310">It is important to ensure that the process of distributing unclaimed assets is publicised in a manner that reflects the exciting opportunity here. It is also important to ensure that investments are presented in a suitably distinctive way, reflecting the once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a lasting difference in communities across our country. We believe that Big has done that in respect of some of its other activities. Therefore, I want the noble Lord to understand that we agree entirely with the sentiment, and I am sure that there is no disagreement in the Committee in that regard. However, we think that we can achieve the desired effect without necessarily amending the Bill. There is nothing to stop us referring to unclaimed assets by a distinctive title but, just as the right reverend Prelate said a few minutes ago, we are not certain that we are prepared to settle now on the expression dreamt up by the noble Lord. We think that it is a good try but even he may think that this is not the best description. Perhaps we can consider his suggestion along with others, or perhaps the noble Lord will come up with other suggestions. I think that he understands the spirit on which my reply is based&#151;we like the idea but we are not sure that that is the right title.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08011068000311">So far as concerns the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, again, we take his point. It is a probing amendment about publicity regarding the money that will come from the dormant funds. Our view is that dormant account funds are the public&#146;s money, and it is therefore of paramount importance that we achieve the transparency and clarity that he seeks in relation to where the money goes and who benefits. We would go so far as to say  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC382"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column GC382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that accountability is the key. It is important that people are able to understand and recognise the effective use of the funds in communities across the country. Effective reporting will reinforce such transparency if the public are to support and have confidence in this worthwhile scheme.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08011068000312">Concerns were expressed at Second Reading about the need for dormant money to be treated and accounted separately from lottery money. Indeed, I think that that is what the noble Lord is seeking in his probing amendment, and we agree with him. The Big Lottery Fund has been very clear. It will publicise, brand, report and account for dormant accounts funding separately from lottery funding, and we understand why it is important that it should do that in this case.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000318">The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 57, I will also speak to related Amendments Nos. 58, 59 and 63 in this group. These are probing amendments to Clauses 15 and 16 designed to tease out exactly how dormant account money is to be calculated and distributed. This is not particularly easy territory even for accountants so I apologise in advance if this is difficult to follow.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08011068000319">Amendment No. 57 paves the way for Amendments Nos. 58 and 59 and amends Clause 15. The definition of &#147;dormant account money&#148; in Clause 15 is important because it drives the &#147;apportionable income&#148; of the Big Lottery Fund as set out in Clause 16 and hence how much can be distributed under Clauses 17 to 20 to the various countries for good causes. The definition of &#147;dormant account money&#148; in Clause 15(2) starts with the amounts transferred by the reclaim fund. That is not difficult. Then it moves on and &#147;includes the proceeds&#148; of money, which is invested either under the National Lottery Act or under this Bill. I believe that this concept of including proceeds is a problem because it focuses on the return from an investment but ignores the initial investment.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08011068000320">For example, if the Big Lottery Fund receives &#163;1,000 from the reclaim fund and invests &#163;300, it has &#163;700 left in cash in its bank account. That is what is  


<notus-date day="10" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC383"><b>10 Jan 2008 : Column GC383</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>available to pass to distribution bodies. There are no proceeds from investment because it is simply invested money, so Clause 15(2) says that the amount of dormant account money is &#163;1,000&#151;the amount received from the reclaim fund&#151;which has to be apportioned under Clause 16. But that cannot be right because there is only &#163;700 in the bank ready for distribution.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08011068000321">The effect of my Amendments Nos. 57 and 58 would be that, first, you deduct any money which is invested and then add the proceeds from those investments, including interest. I have drafted that in for the sake of completeness as &#147;proceeds&#148; is rather a vague word. It would then work out that the dormant account money in the year of cash outflows for investment would reduce the money before it became apportionable income. In my example that would be &#163;700 because it would have reduced by the amount invested.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08011068000322">Amendment No. 59 also picks up another anomaly in the calculation of dormant account money. Let us suppose that the Big Lottery Fund has made a loan of &#163;100 when it distributed some money in year one. In year five, the money is paid back in full but with a return, probably interest, of &#163;25, so that &#163;125 actually flows back to the fund. That extra &#163;25 is not within the definition of dormant account money in Clause 15(2) because it is neither money received from the reclaim fund nor the proceeds of specified types of investment in Clause 15(2), and it does not appear to be dealt with in any other way. My Amendment No. 59 says that the excess over the amount originally loaned or granted is added to the dormant account income.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08011068000323">That just leaves making sure that the capital amount of any loan or grant, when it is repaid, is treated correctly. The Bill appears to be silent on that, too.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08011068000324">The &#163;100 in my previous example, when it flows back as a repayment, appears in a form of limbo. My Amendment No. 63 tackles this by saying that the amount repaid up to the amount of the original grant or loan is not treated as apportionable income and is available for expenditure only on the category of income from which it was first made. I am not sure that the wording precisely achieves this, but the intention is that if a loan or grant was made from money for meeting English expenditure, it should continue to be treated in that way, so that, if my &#163;100 was a loan to an English youth facility, on repayment it would be recycled within the English expenditure category and would hence be eligible for meeting further English expenditure, not treated as part of the apportionable income whereby other countries got a bit of it.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08011068000325">I hope that the Minister has followed those points. The amendments are offered in a spirit of seeking to make the Bill work properly in practice. I beg to move. </p>

I hope that we can give her some kind of answer to her specific examples, but if we cannot, we will go away and think carefully about what she said, because this is an important point. Whether she is right&#151;which she undoubtedly thinks she is&#151;or not, it is necessary that we do some more thinking about the accountancy points that she raises. Let me do my best.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para16">
<p><a name="08011068000327">Her first amendment appears to be aimed at ensuring that any sums of money generated through the investment of reclaimed fund money, either by Big or by its agent under Clause 24 on investment provision, including interest repaid to Big under the terms of a loan, are available for distribution in addition to the money originally transferred from the reclaim fund. I hope that I can reassure the noble Baroness that these changes are not necessary to the drafting of the Bill as it stands. It goes without saying that we accept and agree with the spirit of her amendments and that the proceeds of any investment of unclaimed assets in the reclaim fund should be recycled back into money available for distribution.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08011068000328">We believe that the Bill already delivers this by way of the definition of dormant accounts money in Clause 15&#151;the very passage that she referred to. The principal from the reclaim fund plus the proceeds of that sum are invested either in Big or by its agent under the Clause 25 provision. The second amendment goes with the first. We do not think that the third amendment is necessary; it is concerned to ensure that where Big has loaned money and received the principal back with interest, all of the money goes back into the dormant account pot. That money is within the definition, too.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08011068000329">The final amendment seeks to ensure that where Big has made a loan, rather than a grant, when the loan is repaid an amount equivalent to the original payment is recycled back into the spending area where the loan was originally made. We do not believe it is appropriate to set a requirement like this in the legislation. The detailed approach to distributing unclaimed assets is yet to be developed and we are obviously going to draw on a wide range of evidence in developing it to inform our directions to Big.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08011068000330">We can conceive of a position where the relative weight of spending on the various priorities would change over time for wholly appropriate reasons, perhaps, because some priorities involve more concentrated up-front investment in facilities, while others relating more to the provision of services and advice are more ongoing in nature. Therefore, we would not want Big necessarily to be barred from recycling most of the receipts of a repaid loan that was made to support one purpose in the past to help meet the funding requirements of another priority, if that was more pressing at the time. We would not want to be tied down by the legislation to the approach which the noble Baroness put forward in her amendment.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08011068000331">While distribution through loans may be appropriate in some circumstances, which is why it is in the Bill&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and other noble Lords will be interested in social enterprises, for example, because they have indicated that they prefer

We would not expect it to be the predominant means of funding and large sums of money therefore to flow back into loans.</p>

<a name="80110-gc0008.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08011068000332">We do not envisage Big investing other than to manage money not yet needed for distribution. Investment plus proceeds will be made available when needed for distribution. As far as grants made and repaid are concerned, money will go back into the general pot for the country for which the money is to be distributed. I assure the Committee that English money will stay in England.</p>

<p><a name="08011068000333">I am conscious that my answer has not dealt with the detailed points that the noble Baroness made, which is why I said at the outset that we would like to consider in more detail why she thinks that the present wording is unsatisfactory and whether we might come back with a form a words that is more in line, if not exactly in line, with her amendments. That can be usefully done between now and Report. We are trying to get to the same point; it is just a question of what wording is appropriate.

Following the Communication Hub relocation in 2006 to RAF Leeming instead of RAF Scampton the decision regarding the future basing of ASACS units needed to be reconsidered.

<a name="80110-wms0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"><a name="08011054000037">Today we are publishing <I>Think Family: Improving the L</I><I>ife </I><I>C</I><I>hances of </I><I>F</I><I>amilies at </I><I>R</I><I>isk</I>. This forms the next stage of the Families at Risk Review led by the Social Exclusion Task Force and follows on from the publication of <I>Reaching Out: Think Family</I> in June 2007.</p>

<a name="80110-wms0001.htm_para26">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"><a name="08011054000038"><I>Think Family</I> argues that excellent children's services, and excellent adults&#146; services, are not enough in isolation. To transform life chances and break the cycle of disadvantage, services must go further. Today&#146;s report builds on the review&#146;s earlier analytical work by setting out a vision of an integrated system that &#147;thinks family&#148; at every level. The goal is to extend the logic of integration behind <I>Every Child Matters</I> beyond children&#146;s services to include adults&#146; services and promote collaboration and co-ordination around the needs of the family.</p>

<a name="80110-wms0001.htm_para27">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"><a name="08011054000039">There are four key principles that underpin a system that &#147;thinks family&#148;. First, there is no &#147;wrong door&#148; to effective support, and contact with any service opens a door into a system of joined-up support. Secondly, services take a &#147;whole family&#148; approach, responding to clients as family members and supporting parental responsibilities. Thirdly, professionals start with a family&#146;s strengths and build on a family's capacity to take responsibility for their own lives. Fourthly, the system provides support tailored to need.</p>

<a name="80110-wms0001.htm_para28">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"><a name="08011054000040">The system design is based upon findings from extensive research and consultation with practitioners, local policy makers and families themselves. To take this vision forward DCSF has launched an invitation to local authorities to apply to become one of the  &#163;13 million family pathfinders set out in <I>Think Family</I> and the Children's Plan. The family pathfinders will improve service delivery to families at risk through change at all levels of the system; from strategy and governance through to the delivery of front-line services. The pathfinders will build on the learning from innovative family-based services such as the family intervention projects. Working alongside the network of local authorities involved in the Narrowing the Gap project, these pathfinders will help to generate learning about how local areas can transform outcomes by &#147;thinking family&#148;. An additional &#163;3 million will be made available over the next three years for extended family pathfinders which will also look in depth at how better forms of support can be built around families in which children are taking on caring responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80110-wms0001.htm_para29">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"><a name="08011054000041">The family pathfinders will sit at the heart of a wider process of learning shared between central and local government, practitioners and families themselves to help drive change in every local area.</p>

Because the plan is long-term in nature, it is not considered conducive to its operation to allow plants whose operators exercise that option to be withdrawn from it at any time. Furthermore, even if a participating plant closes, it is necessary for its previous participation in it to remain recorded in the plan.

The housing Green Paper published in July 2007 set out how we intend to eliminate poor development over time. We consider that expert advice on schemes at the pre-planning stage can play an important role in driving better standards, and we currently fund the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) to provide a free service that reviews significant schemes at national level. CABE is also providing support for the establishment of design review panels at regional level.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_105"><a name="08011053000232">As announced in the housing Green Paper, the Government are commissioning a light-touch review of CABE. This review will consider how its programmes can strategically inform and support both its sponsor departments' priorities most effectively, including maximising its contribution to good design as we expand housing growth. This will include consideration of how we can maximise the effectiveness of its design review function.</p>
