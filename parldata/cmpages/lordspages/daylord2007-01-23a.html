The capital construction costs for the redevelopment of the Crown Courts at Isleworth remain in the region of &#163;18.2 million, at 2006 prices. In addition to the capital construction costs, further costs will be incurred, such as DCA professional adviser fees, the project team costs and the non-capital element of the fit-out costs, including loose furniture, IT services and library books, as identified in my Written Ministerial Statement on 17 October 2006. Spend to date on both projects has been &#163;5.9 million capital and &#163;1.8 million resource. I will provide further information on reaching closure with the preferred bidders, which are Kier Group plc for the Middlesex Guildhall and Geoffrey Osborne Building Limited for Isleworth.

Instead of seeking to redebate an issue on which Parliament has made a firm decision, we should work together to get the best possible Supreme Court. As for the costs, civil litigation charges fees and some of those fees will contribute to part of the costs.</p>

While I have no doubt that Feilden and Mawson will handle the brief with appropriate sensitivity if the project goes ahead, what assurance can my noble and learned friend give that the quality of what is installed will be as fine as the quality of what is removed?</p>

Before the local authority gave planning permission it was extremely concerned that appropriate homes should be found for the exquisite court furniture. That has been done&#151;and only once it had been done was final planning permission given.</p>

Parliament, having heard all of these issues, concluded that we should have a Supreme Court. The reason why it is worth having a Supreme Court is that there should be a separate and identifiable court at the apex of the judicial system and that we should separate the legislature from the courts.</p>

We are developing a regulatory regime for carbon capture and storage in the UK. In the Pre-Budget Report, the Government undertook to consider the cost-effectiveness of CCS demonstration.

Does it not therefore follow that measures to bring about the collection and storage of carbon should be introduced urgently? Furthermore, is the noble Lord aware that a number of firms have expressed an interest in building commercial plants using this system&#151;which has been fully developed at the experimental stage? Can he give us an assurance that the Government will give them every possible support in so doing?</p>

On his general position, the noble Lord is absolutely right: coal will play a very important part in electricity generation worldwide, particularly in China and India. There are opportunities which we are looking at closely. If we are successful in developing clean coal and carbon storage in this country, we may be able to make progress on behalf of both the Chinese and the Indians to mutual advantage.

Will the Minister comment in more detail on the prospect of underground gasification, which many in County Durham believe would offer a cleaner and more efficient long-term&#151;albeit expensive in the short term&#151;energy alternative? Does he agree that this would reduce the proverbial silliness of importing coal to Newcastle&#151;nearly 50 million tonnes per year&#151;and also give new hope to communities that are still suffering the effects of the 1980s?

How much are the Government prepared to spend on, for instance, making sure that footpaths are signposted and that many of them are available throughout the year, perhaps by building better surfaces? How can that be offset against higher spending in the Department of Health? If this calculation has not been done, is it not about time that it was?</p>

Governments can commit the countryside to be available to the nation, as we did with the right to roam in the Act that we passed a few years ago.

Of course, we have to use political mechanisms to try to bring about a ceasefire, and that is what we are seeking to do. In addition, the talks last year in Addis Ababa resulted in the international community mapping out a way forward, including the need not only for a ceasefire but for a renewed political process and a hybrid AU/UN peacekeeping force. That is now being put in place but movement on it is slow. The issue of President Bashir and the African Union is a matter for the African Union. However, we have drawn to the AU&#146;s attention&#151;we went through the same debate last year&#151;the importance of ensuring that whoever leads the African Union can command the respect of the international community.</p>

They say that, without decisive intervention, the humanitarian situation will be irreversibly jeopardised. They point out that access has already been compromised and is worse than at any time since April 2004, and that in the past six months 400 aid workers have been forced to relocate 31 times. Does the Leader of the House not agree that, along with the 4 million people who are now being denied access and the 400,000 who have died in Darfur, a principal casualty has been the Security Council, as its credibility and authority have been eroded by our failure to take decisive action?</p>

I have had a word with the noble Lord. Thank you very much. Amendment No. 139F would subsume Amendment No. 52 because it is applicable only to directions from the LSB under Clause 31. The situation has changed overnight. My noble friend Lord Kingsland raised the issue of judicial review at Second Reading but there was no response to his question.

<p><a name="07012339000212"></a>At 10 o'clock it was accepted that the LSB was subject to judicial review, a concession for which I am indeed grateful, so I scrapped my speaking notes. Today, therefore, the question that arises is whether that concession should be in the Bill. Should it be in Amendment No. 139F or Amendment No. 65 or in neither? I am not speaking to the amendment, but merely referring to the dilemma. We now have to address that issue. If that is so, in what form should that amendment be?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07012339000082"></a>This is not just a situation in which we can sit back and rely on Pepper v Hart, which is a source of last relief. As appears from yesterday&#146;s debate on the framework within which the LSB operates, it is not at all clear and clarity is highly relevant to judicial review. We must therefore consider, in summary, what we are dealing with. Today, we are in effect dealing with a continuation of what happened yesterday. It was proposed that the structure of the Bill should define the perimeter within which the LSB should exercise its discretion; that the integrity of the approved regulators be acknowledged in the Bill; and that the quality and standards of legal services be maintained, as set by self-regulation, and recognised in the Bill. It was also proposed that a fair balance between the interests of the consumer and the approved regulator be assured; that the LSB should only intervene on the complaint of the consumer after notice has been given to the approved regulator to enable representation; that some acceptable means to that end should be devised; and that the conflict between the regulatory objectives was to be resolved proportionately, taking into account all such obligations of like importance on a balance, if fine, to be tipped in favour of public interest, as spoken to on Clause 1.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07012339000083"></a>That could be achieved by a series of piecemeal amendments, or by a trigger clause in primary legislation, requiring the Secretary of State to introduce regulations enabling him to issue and require a code of practice, having full legal efficacy in the civil field, as spoken to by Lord Denning, Lord Elwyn-Jones and Lord Henderson of Brompton, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, and other noble Lords in a short debate on 15 January 1986, cols. 1075 to 1104. Such a code could assimilate merely procedural provisions without eroding or overloading the structure of the primary legislation.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07012339000084"></a>I do not know how this is to be resolved. It could be a &#147;multi-approach&#148;: some of the procedural provisions could be dealt with in the code, having legal effect; some provisions would essentially have to remain in the Bill. I cannot entertain how that should be done; in fact, I do not know. It is a difficult matter to resolve, but I do know that it must be done.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07012339000085"></a>If the Government were to accept Amendment No. 65, then, subject to the advice of my noble friends Lord Kingsland and Lord Hunt of Wirral, one would have to consider whether these judicial review amendments would be required in the amended Bill, or whether they would be otiose, as the principle would have been accepted.</p>

I have the greatest possible respect for him, and I have disagreed with him on too many occasions. With respect, the noble Lord seems to be unaware that consumer interests can be contrary to public interests and that if they are, as was explained by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, they must be subservient to the public interest. That is the first concept that I ask the noble Lord to consider. The noble Lord does not seem to be aware that it is in

I hope that, as chairman of the National Consumer Council, the noble Lord will accept that what he said about limiting the potential for intervention cannot and does not affect judgment on the gravity of a complaint from the council about the conduct of the Law Society, which is only one of the approved regulators. I say nothing about the Bar Council because I have too close an interest to declare. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, entertains a serious misconception.

The amendment, to which I readily put my name, provides for one means of challenge, but the Joint Committee was greatly exercised by the fact that the Bill provides restricted rights of statutory appeal. Paragraph 186 of the Joint Committee&#146;s report states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07012339000221"></a>&#147;Other than in one case, the draft Bill provides no right of appeal against the decisions of the LSB ... In short, an approved regulator has a statutory route of appeal against the imposition of financial penalties, but no access to judicial review. If any other sanction is imposed, there is no statutory right of appeal, but the decision of the LSB may be subject to judicial review&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012339000088"></a>I find this very confusing.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07012339000089"></a>Many of the witnesses who gave evidence were concerned about the restricted rights of statutory appeal. The Government, in their response, rejected the recommendation at paragraph 191 of the report where the Joint Committee stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07012339000222"></a>&#147;We support the recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution on this issue and we recommend that the draft Bill be amended to include a right of appeal to the High Court against regulatory decisions by the Legal Services Board. In line with existing practice, this right to appeal to the High Court should require the permission of a judge&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012339000213"></a>We will, of course, be debating this issue in other groups of amendments.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07012339000090"></a>Turning to judicial review, there have been a number of interesting cases&#151;I see some very wise judicial minds present in the Chamber who have much more knowledge than I&#151;and in the case of R v Ministry of Defence ex p Smith [1966] the then Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, referred to the courts seeking to fill a vacuum. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07012339000223"></a>&#147;To avoid a vacuum in which the citizen would be left without protection against a misuse of executive powers the courts have had no option but to occupy the dead ground in a manner, and in areas of public life, which could not have been foreseen 30 years ago. For myself, I am quite satisfied that this unprecedented judicial role has been greatly to the public benefit&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012339000214"></a>I find that fascinating.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para14"></a>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="07012339000224"></a>&#147;Absent a written constitution much sensitivity is required of the parliamentarian, administrator and judge if the delicate balance of the unwritten rules evolved (I believe successfully) in recent years is not to be disturbed, and all the recent advances undone ... But the boundaries remain; they are of crucial significance to our private and public lives; and the courts should I believe make sure that they are not overstepped&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012339000092"></a>Do we believe that it is right to leave this &#147;dead ground&#148; dead? I think the Minister owes the Committee an explanation of the Government&#146;s view of judicial review.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07012339000093"></a>The Government&#146;s consultation paper <I>Access to Justice with Conditional Fees, </I>published in March 1998, was a disaster if ever there was one because no proper research was carried out into conditional fees; there were no pilot schemes or anything of that kind. However, it stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07012339000225"></a>&#147;The Government believes that the ability to challenge the acts or omissions of public authorities is a necessary check on the use of the power of the State and a positive encouragement to maintain high standards in public administration or by public bodies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012339000215"></a>So, in a way, judicial review is where the judiciary has had to assume the constitutional responsibility of curbing power. Speaking on behalf of the Joint Committee and its unanimous recommendation, I would far prefer that the Bill clearly set out exactly what rights the approved regulator has so far as appeal is concerned. That is why I await with great interest what I hope will be a positive response to the amendment from the Minister.</p>

<a name="70123-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07012339000095"></a>Broadly, the Bill spells out three powers for the Legal Services Board: to give directions, to issue censures and to impose financial penalties. It is perhaps slightly remarkable that such detailed attention is given to the issue of how there may be an appeal against financial penalties but not to appeals against public censure or directions, which may be challengeable in the public interest. The question is very simple: why the distinction?</p>

We shall come to it in a different guise when we come to Amendment No. 56 and the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart. It is all about the question of appeal, whether in the form of a straightforward appeal to the High Court, as we find in Amendment No. 56, or of judicial review. It comes down to a principle that I think the Government would readily accept, that no body that exercises power ought to exercise it in the absence of review to the courts or some superior appellate body. That is a very important constitutional principle; otherwise the power is potentially unfettered.</p>

Whether they would be entitled to appeal if the directions were not against them is a more difficult question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07012339000098"></a>In this probing amendment, as my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway&#151;to whom I am greatly indebted for raising the matter&#151;said at the outset, one is interested to hear how the Government and the Minister approach the matter. I would hope, as I say, that their approach fully recognised the principle of some form of effective appeal, and gave us some guidance on how they think that can best be dealt with, not just in the comparatively focused&#151;and, to that extent, comparatively narrow&#151;way that which to be covered by the Bill as presently drafted, but in terms of how we should end up.</p>

I recognise the importance of having a judicial review safeguard which can take wider issues into account, including different interpretations of the public interest in these matters. I will, however, be opposing Amendment No. 56. The Government need to make it clear that judicial review would, in certain circumstances at least, be available in this area, as they attempted to do earlier, but that detailed appeal structures, particularly in areas of relatively minor sanctions, would not be appropriate.</p>

This issue arose with the use of the phrase &#147;raising the threshold&#148; on the Liberal Democrat Benches regarding when the LSB could intervene. That was in the context of the concept that the LSB&#146;s function was to respond to a complaint, particularly from the institution of which the noble Lord is chairman, but not, so to speak, to intervene otherwise within the general province of the regulators. I think that the noble Lord objected to that limitation on the grounds he gave, which I hope he now understands were perhaps not well conceived.</p>

I object to a series of amendments that seem to be proposed in this Committee which would somehow hobble the Legal Services Board, leaving it a toothless tiger, if I can mix my minor veterinary operation metaphors.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07012339000102"></a>I accept, however&#151;I think that I made this clear last night&#151;that the ideal position is that the Legal Services Board would be a light-touch regulator, intervening very rarely. But it is a supervisory board, and in any supervisory situation, whether in the workplace or in structures of institutions, the secret of being a good supervisor is to tread softly and carry a big stick which you occasionally show but, if possible, never use. It seems that the same relationship exists  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1010"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1010</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between the LSB and the front-line regulators. It has to have theoretically strong powers to enable the Law Society, in particular, to raise its game in fear of those deterrents; but the objective of the whole structure is that it would not have to use it very often, if at all, once the Law Society had raised its game.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07012339000107"></a>I join all noble Lords who have congratulated my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway on introducing this intriguing probing amendment. In a way, the debate that my noble friend has engendered has anticipated about seven or eight detailed amendments which deal individually with Clauses 31 to 40. But I have concluded that it is helpful to try and grapple with the central issue that lies behind these amendments at this juncture.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07012339000108"></a>Ideally, what the Government ought to have done for Clauses 31 to 40 and perhaps beyond, too, would have been to provide a general right of appeal to the High Court, making it clear that all the remedies available in a judicial review action would be available to a litigant seeking to exercise that right of appeal. What we have instead, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, said, is a limited number of clauses against which a right of appeal can be exercised. In addition, the right of appeal is qualified by what is traditionally described as an ouster clause. There is no mention whatever of judicial review in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07012339000109"></a>Naturally, that has led many of your Lordships to ask three questions. First, are all the remedies which would be available to somebody utilising judicial review available under the current rights of appeal? That is the first line of questioning. The second is: what is the intended reach of the ouster clause? The third is: in circumstances where there is no right of appeal, can judicial review be used?</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07012339000110"></a>This is perhaps a little unfair, because I know that the noble Baroness was going to deal with these issues incrementally, but it would be helpful to have some general guidance at this point.</p>

I was reflecting on those with my officials this morning and how important I felt our discussions had been. I was able to consider a number of matters, as I had agreed to do, and look forward to discussing those away from your Lordships' House as well as on the Floor of the House at Report.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07012339000112"></a>I intend to try and be the sensitive parliamentarian to whom the noble Lord referred. This fits in with the jigsaw he described to us yesterday that he wants us to put together. I will wait until the final day of Committee to ask whether he thinks that we have completed the jigsaw puzzle in taking forward all these issues.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07012339000113"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is right that we have before us a number of amendments that deal with the specifics on appeal. Let me answer the specific amendments, as I would find it helpful to put that on the record, and deal as well with the particular questions that were so succinctly put by the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07012339000114"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and other noble Lords that judicial review will be the appropriate remedy in instances where approved regulators want to challenge the lawfulness of the board&#146;s regulatory decisions. As it is a public body, the board&#146;s decisions are already subject to judicial review. We have drafted the Bill to allow for this; we do not think that it has to be stated in the Bill because that is the way that it will work.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07012339000115"></a>We do not want to set out in the Bill what the judiciary may consider when reviewing the legality of the board&#146;s regulatory decisions. For example, compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights is already a matter for consideration on judicial review. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, knows that well, not least from his distinguished work on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, before which, as Minister responsible for human rights, I have had the privilege to appear. We do not see the need to remind the judiciary of what should be considered in the exercise of their supervisory jurisdiction. We are concerned that putting things in the Bill might inadvertently restrict the ambit of any such review or suggest that other grounds are less valid or are to be accorded less weight. We would not wish to do that accidentally, so we are not drawn to putting such provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07012339000116"></a>The noble Lord has drawn to our attention a number of important points which he believes may require consideration in judicial review proceedings. I should like to speak briefly about each of those. On proportionality and independence, the board is already under a duty to be proportionate&#151;we discussed this at great length yesterday under Clause 3(3)&#151;and to act in a way that is compatible with the regulatory objectives, which includes encouraging an independent profession. If the board has not complied with these requirements, that would of course form part of a review.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07012339000117"></a>I have already dealt with the point about the European Court of Human Rights. Suffice to say, this has already been taken into account and does not need a specific mention in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07012339000118"></a>I agree with the noble Lord&#146;s sentiment that the quality of legal advice should be kept at the highest standard. When taken together, my view is that the regulatory objectives ensure that the quality of the legal profession and its services, including advice to consumers, is maintained. But we do not think it should be given special consideration over and above other issues.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07012339000119"></a>In Amendment No. 139F, the same concerns apply, but to a greater extent, given that it sets out the grounds on which judicial review can be applied for rather than considerations that may be considered. Again, I am not drawn to putting the conditions in the Bill because I do not want to narrow or limit the breadth of judicial review. That would not be beneficial for consumers or for the approved regulators.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07012339000120"></a>I do not want to reopen the debate on public interest&#151;we have already debated that at length. Suffice to say, the board has a duty in this regard, and its failure to comply with it could be a ground for judicial review. Similarly, an approved regulator could and should apply to the court for judicial review if the board&#146;s decision fails to comply with the European Court of Human Rights or the tenets of natural justice, however inconceivable that is.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07012339000121"></a>I hope that when the noble Lord reflects on the detailed response I have given to the points in his amendments, he will feel that I have covered them.</p>

The procedure of judicial review has arisen&#151;this was borne out by the quotations that I utilised&#151;out of the fact that the Government left no other course. As Michael Fordham put it very well in his <I>Judicial Review Handbook,</I></p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07012339000226"></a>&#147;By judicial review, the judiciary assumes the constitutional responsibility of curbing executive power&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07012339000216"></a>For the Government now to encourage judicial review, when it was only spawned as the sole real method of curbing executive power, is fascinating.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07012339000123"></a>I believe the Minister said that she did not want to limit the extent of judicial review. I well remember the words of former Home Secretary David Blunkett about the result of one or two such reviews, but it is strange for the Government to be contemplating that it is the right remedy. We will come to that matter later, but surely it is better to include in the Bill clear appeal procedures rather than leave it to a procedure that has evolved as the only means of curbing executive power.</p>

I was seeking to deal with the detail of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, by going through them line by line and addressing where judicial review would apply. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is a lawyer and I am not, but one thing I know for sure about legislation is that it is always difficult to set out all the circumstances that might apply when one makes application to the court. Indeed, in other parts of our legislative duty, the noble Lord and I would probably argue in

I have sought to explain that, in our view, that would be inappropriate. The right of judicial review is there because the board is a public body. It is an appropriate remedy if people believe that there has been unreasonable behaviour or seek judicial review for other reasons. But to say that it is available on these or other grounds would curb something inappropriately.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07012339000125"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, very reasonably said that you can lodge an appeal later. Although we will come to the detail of that, it is reasonable for him to ask a general question. We have established that judicial review is available. However, the fining power within the Bill is, we believe, a stronger power. Noble Lords and those who are being regulated may also feel that it is stronger, more definitive and has potentially greater and far-reaching consequences. We therefore wanted to add the ability to go to appeal specifically around that power. So we did so, by saying that there would be leave to go to the High Court to appeal on that power.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07012339000126"></a>In order to ensure that we did not end up in a situation where someone could appeal on that and have a judicial review, the ouster clause simply says, &#147;If you're doing that, you can't have the judicial review as well because you already have the right to appeal&#148;. That is what it is for. The purpose of the measure is to provide a judicial review in general and an appeal specifically around fining, but if there is an appeal around fining there is no need for a judicial review as well. The ouster clause therefore says that you cannot do both. That is what this part of the Bill seeks to do.</p>

One has to accept that it is inevitable that some decisions of the LSB are bound to be flawed for the reasons given as grounds in the two amendments to which I have spoken. Perhaps I should accept, having reread the <I>Official Report</I> after I tore up my notes, that I got it wrong when I referred to assembling pieces in a jigsaw to make a pattern. I had it in mind that perhaps&#151;and I think that my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell of Markyate got near the point&#151;there should be one or two amendments to the Bill to cover matters of principle. But so much of a change in structure, to which my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral referred, really should not be like pieces of a jigsaw. These are procedural provisions that should really be introduced by secondary legislation or a code of practice, to which Lord Denning and Lord Elwyn-Jones spoke, to relieve the structure of the Bill from erosion and being over-burdened with detail.</p>

He accepted, however, that there needed to be safeguards in the exercise of those powers, but claimed that the Bill provided for them.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07012339000140"></a>In evidence to the Joint Committee, several witnesses complained about the limited rights of statutory appeal against regulatory decisions by the board. In contrast, the Government considered that the rights were adequate. It is especially striking to the Opposition that the Bill provides no opportunity for an approved regulator to appeal against public censure by the Legal Services Board under Clause 34. It is that lacuna that Amendment No. 56 seeks to address. It is plain to us that the safeguards under the Bill&#151;notification and consultation&#151;provide insufficient protection and, therefore, we seek to incorporate a new clause that will provide an approved regulator with a right of appeal to the High Court against censure.</p>

<a name="70123-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07012339000141"></a>Amendment No. 57 ensures that that new appeal mechanism will operate effectively by providing a short suspensory period between notification of the final terms in which a statement censuring an approved regulator is to be published and actual publication. That will give time for the approved regulator to launch an appeal before the board&#146;s censure is made public. The Government surely could not argue that seven days was an unreasonable period. I beg to move.</p>

This amendment only restates what is available by way of judicial review, because the grounds of appeal are that the decision was either unlawful, ultra vires, or manifestly unreasonable. Any of those grounds would give rise to a successful application for judicial review. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07012339000143"></a>The amendment suggests that the first remedy available on judicial review should be the quashing of the decision, or varying the terms of the statement; perhaps the High Court may not dictate what a statement should be, but it can indicate in its judgment what is or is not acceptable.

I completely accept the role of judicial review in the decisions of the LSB, as do&#151;I think<I>&#151;</I>the Government. We are setting out, in the Bill grounds of appeal to relatively minor sanctions. We have an appellate procedure as regards fines, but when it comes to public censure and variation, we are dealing with relatively minor interventions by the LSB. Normally, appellate bodies are confined to points of law; these are essentially points of judgment. Unless we seriously restrict the LSB in such a way that every one of its relatively minor interventions, or threats of intervention, could lead to the High Court, we are in danger of reducing the influence of the LSB over the behaviour of the Law Society. People will tell me that such appeals will not happen frequently, but we are dealing with lawyers and the legal system. The more we put in the Bill to restrict or second-guess the LSB, the less effective it will become in changing the behaviour of the frontline regulators, which is the objective of this Bill.</p>

That lies behind a lot of the points that are being made.</p>

<a name="07012339000153"></a><b><a name="70123-0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07012339000343"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> I shall try to deal with the points that have been raised. My noble friend Lord Whitty raised a fundamental question about the effect of providing for appeal structures. When I was taking legislation on education through your Lordships' House, I remember that we often debated whether the opportunity to have every possible decision reviewed by an appeals body had a detrimental effect on the regulatory body. We agreed that it was therefore important to be clear about the processes involved, as we have sought to be in this legislation. I have already indicated the appropriate role for judicial review in the context of public bodies. I shall also explain financial penalties when we come to the next group of amendments. For the purposes of addressing this amendment, I shall restate our position on public censure.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07012339000154"></a>We have been very clear in saying that there should not be a general need for appeals from decisions of the board, subject to the exception that I have made for financial penalties, and I shall spell out three reasons why. First, the board will be independent in its composition and decision-making, which is of great importance. Secondly, there are statutory safeguards in the Bill to ensure that fair and transparent procedures must at all times be followed if the board sees fit to sanction an approved regulator. Clause 35 provides that the board may not publish a statement to censure an approved regulator unless it has first given notice to the regulator and considered representations. The clause also provides that where the board proposes to publish a statement, it must allow a period of 28 days or more to allow the approved regulator to make representations. That deals with the understandable concern raised through Amendment No. 57 to ensure that there is time for representations to be made in response. We have allowed for 28 days, which is considerably longer than seven days. Thirdly, for the reasons that I have already indicated, recourse to judicial review will be available in appropriate cases, ensuring that the board may be held to account without the need for a separate appeals procedure. A statement of public censure will be made only where the board considers it appropriate to do so and has followed the prescribed procedure set out in Clause 35. If it publishes a statement where it is unreasonable to do so, or without due regard for the procedural rights of approved regulators, it may be held liable in the courts. To provide for a statutory right of appeal would be unnecessary for those reasons. I hope that noble Lords will reflect on the way in which I have set out my response.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07012339000155"></a>Clause 79 is about alternative business structures. It enables those bodies that wish to be designated as a licensing authority to comply, because they will need to have an appeals body in place. Its aims are quite different and distinct, and it will be extremely helpful. We shall debate it in due course. I mention it now because it is important to make the distinction. Reading the provisions out of its context might give rise to concerns that can be allayed when we get to that part.</p>

By the time you have an obligatory regulatory objective to safeguard the independence and quality of advice, across the board you will get conflicts with the ABS situation, where you have the promotion of competition. I dealt with this briefly before and the noble Baroness said that it was another part of the Bill. I know that, but in a sense it is this part too, because a balance has to be struck. In principle, I merely suggest that this machinery is wholly unsatisfactory.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said that he supported them in principle but drew your Lordships&#146; attention to his own Amendment No. 65, which provides a generalised right for judicial review. That is his solution, which is good in the absence of any other remedy.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07012339000158"></a>There is, though, an important distinction between a statutory right of appeal and judicial review. To obtain judicial review you must first persuade a court to give you permission. That obstacle would not be present if there were a statutory right of appeal. That is why I prefer a generalised system of statutory rights of appeal to a generalised system of judicial review. A statutory right of appeal is especially important under Clause 34 because the public censuring of a statutory body&#151;as an approved regulator would be&#151;is a serious matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07012339000159"></a>Can the noble Baroness give us some illustrations of when she believes that the Legal Services Board is likely to exercise the power under Clause 34?

I do not want to try to give examples. I know why the noble Lord might feel that to be important but I think that it would be wrong to do so.

In other words, we are trying to determine not the way in which a regulatory body might have behaved that would lead to the board&#146;s decisions but the way in which the board would decide how to use its powers. There is a need to be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases where action is needed. Noble Lords have questioned whether we need to strengthen the Bill in part, and, as they know, I am looking at that. We have tried to litter this Bill with references to make it clear that the board has to operate transparently, appropriately and proportionately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07012339000164"></a>For me, designing a board by saying, &#147;This is how you must behave&#148; is a better way of achieving what I think the noble Lord is seeking&#151;that is, it ensures that the board does not exercise its power inappropriately or heavy-handedly and so on. There is unanimity in the Committee about light-touch supervisory regulation. No one has argued against that and the Government do not either. Therefore, how the board uses its powers is about saying, &#147;You must behave in this way&#148;, rather than trying to develop criteria for when it would use them.</p>

Publicly censuring a statutory body such as an approved regulator would, in effect, destroy the credibility of its own board. In my view, it would be impossible for the chairman to carry on, or at least to carry on beyond a few months. In those circumstances, does the noble Baroness not think that he or she and his or her colleagues ought to have a right of appeal? They ought not to have to go to the administrative court and ask for leave for judicial review, which might or might not be given. They should have a statutory right of appeal against such a condemnatory direction by the Legal Services Board.</p>

If one took the extreme view, which the noble Lord has put very well, and said, &#147;In these circumstances, this would happen&#148;, then the board, within its 28 days, would make representations to the LSB and would consider whether it wished to apply for judicial review if it felt that the circumstances warranted it. But we have to start from the principle that the LSB would only ever use that power when it was clearly a proportionate and appropriate measure to take and where it was doing so because it felt that the circumstances warranted it.

It is not always necessary for the organisation&#146;s chairman to resign; public censure is used in all sorts of circumstances. It is not a clear-cut issue, but we have identified the one area of penalty where we think that it is right and proper for such censure to be automatic. However, the public body would be treated appropriately, and we are ensuring that the powers are used appropriately. If the regulator could demonstrate, by leave to the court, that there were grounds that warranted review it would be available. We think that that is the right balance. To open up a statutory right of appeal is to change the nature of the regulator and in a sense to enable a supra-regulator to be on top.</p>

She has also introduced the wonderful phrase &#147;littering the Bill&#148;, which I want to consider, and a new concept of light-touch public censure.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07012339000174"></a>What really lies behind the concern of many of your Lordships is the fact that we are dealing here with a regulator publicly censuring another regulator. That does not sound like the positive partnership structure which the Joint Committee recommended. We all want the regulators to work in partnership and to regulate the sector effectively, but the idea of the General Council of the Bar or the Master of the Faculties or the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys being censured publicly by the Legal Services Board for activities that it is carrying out as an approved regulator on a non-commercial basis leads me to ask the Minister to give some examples of where this formula is successful. I speak for all Members of the Joint Committee in saying that we cannot see that as part of a positive partnership, which, as we heard from Bridget Prentice, she wanted to promote.</p>

I spoke about a light touch and I think I also used the expression &#147;a rap across the knuckles&#148;. I was trying to point out that, even within a concept such as public censure, I could imagine circumstances where that would not lead to the kind of catastrophic consequences that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised in his example. I stand by that and I consider it to be appropriate. As regards littering the Bill, that is an expression I use. I am from Lancashire, so what do you expect? I was trying to indicate that if one looks across this legislation one can see examples of that.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07012339000176"></a>I turn to the nub of what the noble Lord has said about the partnership between the two. My honourable friend Bridget Prentice, who is the Minister with responsibility for this Bill, rightly indicated, as I hope I have done, that the nature of the relationship between the supervisory regulator and the approved regulator is very important. They should work in concert; we expect them to develop this regulatory framework together. We have tried to set out the framework&#151;whether I have been successful or not in doing so&#151;to enable that to happen.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07012339000177"></a>At the end of the day, the supervisory role is real. The body must be able to act if things have gone wrong. It is about regulation. Inevitably, through legislation we focus on the negative side of the equation because we are looking at what might go wrong and the circumstances that might arise. We do not know what they will be; as I have indicated, I trust  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1022"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1022</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they might never happen, but they might. It is quite important that we are clear, for the benefit of the approved regulators and for the supervisory body, so that if those circumstances arise, powers are available to the supervisory regulator. I hope they work closely together and I hope the supervisory body never needs to use these powers. The purpose of the exercise is to set good regulation that will be acclaimed by the public, by the consumer and, I trust, by the profession.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07012339000179"></a>If censure is proposed, will there be a right of appeal? The discussion has concerned whether the right of appeal should be the right of appeal that exists, without it being put into the Bill, to seek leave of the High Court to bring a judicial review, or whether there should be an express right of appeal on the face of the Bill. I know that that is a later amendment, but it must be discussed in this context.</p>

<a name="70123-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07012339000180"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland enlightened me when he pointed out that the right of appeal he has in mind is to the High Court, which would exercise it on judicial review principles. It has always been at the back of my mind&#151;and probably at the front of the Minister&#146;s&#151;that the High Court will not want to substitute its view for that of the Legal Services Board; it will simply wish to steer the Legal Services Board back on to the right course in considering the right matters and being proportionate. I was looking for a light touch in the Bill, and the closest thing to it is in Clause 3(3)(a), which refers to:</p>
<ul><a name="07012339000240"></a>&#147;the principles under which regulatory activities should be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="07012339000217"></a>the word &#147;only&#148; is important&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07012339000241"></a>&#147;at cases in which action is needed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012339000218"></a>It is exactly when one of the regulatory bodies feels that it is being unnecessarily or disproportionately targeted that a right of appeal will be healthy. I am inclined to think that it would be wise simply to build that right of appeal into the structure of the Bill, rather than this slightly difficult &#147;dong-dong&#148; position of knowing when one should apply for judicial review. I throw those out as thoughts, and hope that they are of assistance in leading us to the right answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07012339000182"></a>To create a situation where every attempt by the Legal Services Board to use its powers would be open to an automatic right to go to the High Court is not the right way forward. It is more appropriate for bodies who feel that the board has genuinely treated them badly to apply to the courts for leave for judicial review. The courts would look at the circumstances and, I have no doubt, if appropriate, allow it. Financial penalties must be looked at in a distinctly separate way.</p>

To enable bodies to be treated properly and appropriately, however, is the right course of action. The safeguards are exactly as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, has said: the way in which the board is required to act ensures that it does so appropriately. I go back to my point in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who is no longer in his place: it is ultimately a supervisory body that is able to take decisions, acting appropriately, in circumstances where it must.</p>

We believe that financial penalties are inappropriate mechanisms for dealing with public interest bodies. It is usual for direct regulators of services, particularly services provided on a commercial basis, to have the power to fine those who fail to comply with regulatory requirements; but it is extremely unusual for there to be a power to fine a body that is carrying out regulatory activities on a non-commercial basis. The Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence has no power to fine any professional body in the medical field, nor does the Financial Reporting Council have power to fine any accountancy body. Given that the Legal Services Board has extensive power to make directions and that those directions are enforceable, it is far from clear that any power to fine approved regulators is necessary. The Joint Committee drew attention to this point in its report and the Government, as I understand it, promised to reconsider the issue. Nevertheless, the power to fine remains in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07012339000194"></a>In the circumstances of legal services regulation, day-to-day responsibility for regulatory action will rest with the professional body&#146;s regulatory arm. The representative side will not be able to control the way in which the regulatory arm operates; indeed, it would be a serious breach of the principle of independence if it were to seek to do so. But any fine would not, in reality, impact on the regulatory arm. Unless the fine were charged against the regulation side budget&#151;which would presumably defeat the whole purpose of the fine since it would make it more difficult for the regulatory arm to put right whatever failing had led to the fine&#151;it would, effectively, be borne by the professional body itself, and thus by its members. Members of the regulatory arm will not even be subject to any sanction from an electorate for having incurred the fine since they are all appointed under Nolan principles, rather than being elected. The consequence must be that the representative side, and hence its members, would bear the whole burden of the fine without being able to exert any effective influence over the failings that led to the fine. That simply cannot be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07012339000195"></a>If the Government are not prepared to think again about the principle, which was so well aired in the course of the proceedings of the Joint Committee, we ask them to look as an alternative at the amendments we have tabled. The purpose of Amendment No. 61, on the assumption that these financial provisions remain in the Bill, is to provide some protection for professional bodies against the situation I have described. If the Legal Services Board could fine approved regulators only after they had failed to comply with a direction, the professional body would at least be put on notice of the risk of a fine. The professional bodies could ensure that the contracts with their regulatory arms required each member to do all that he or she could to ensure that any directions from the Legal Services Board were complied with. This would substantially reduce the risk of a professional body being fined for failings it could do absolutely nothing whatever about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07012339000196"></a>Amendment No. 62 is an attempt at a further safeguard by ensuring that the board would not impose financial penalties where lesser sanctions would suffice. It is designed to prevent what I would describe as a &#147;capricious use&#148; of the power to fine. There would inevitably be media pressure on regulators to flex their muscles by exercising their powers to fine at every opportunity, which is, in our view, poor regulatory practice. Good regulatory practice requires regulators to use the least heavy-handed sanction that will meet the regulatory need. Plainly it would be unacceptable to fine an approved regulator simply because the thresholds for doing so have been met. The power to fine should be properly exercised only when the Legal Services Board is satisfied that no lesser sanction would suffice.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07012339000197"></a>The Government have accepted this principle in relation to the board&#146;s power to intervene in the functions of approved regulators. If the board is to have the power to fine, then there is no apparent reason why it should not also be subject to that test. I beg to move.</p>

Although I shall listen with great interest to the views of the Minister, this power is undoubtedly draconian. It could be invoked if there is objective evidence of harm flowing from what is described in Clause 36(1)(a) as an &#147;adverse impact&#148; on the regulatory objectives of the approved regulator. It is very much an objective test whether or not there is harm. Nothing is imported into the clause to suggest that that harm might have been reasonably foreseeable, that the action taken was deliberate and reckless, or that there was any kind of mens rea involved; the only test is whether or not there was harm. If harm is considered in all the circumstances to have flowed from the approved regulator&#146;s action then, at the discretion of the LSB, a fine may be imposed.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07012339000199"></a>There has to be some sort of consideration of the morality of the clause. This is a powerful discretion to give in the absence of deliberation or awareness of the consequences. It may be argued by the Government that it is the duty of the approved regulator to give such consideration that adverse out-turns would not happen. I am bound to say, however, that it seems possible that with the very best of intentions the approved regulator could take a decision that had an effect that had not been anticipated. It would be wholly inappropriate to allow a discretion to fine the regulator in those circumstances. An altogether more gentle approach would be appropriate in second-guessing the sometimes difficult judgments that have to be made by approved regulators.</p>

The Government&#146;s stated intention is that the Legal Services Board should act in partnership with the approved regulators, seeking to resolve differences by agreement. I hope that very few differences will ever arise. But all this structure, particularly the power of fining, is a bit over the top. I hope the Minister will respond to my noble friend in giving us some examples. I was struck by my noble friend&#146;s examples of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, the Financial Reporting Council and other bodies that have a supervisory role over other regulators, but do not have these sorts of draconian powers.</p>

We agreed with that. However, the exercise of all these powers by one regulator over another has no real precedent, and is, as I have said, a recipe for conflict. I hope that we might return to the notion of positive partnership and try to lead the Minister to make a few concessions here. The Government promised to look again at the whole question in response to the Joint Select Committee report. They have not moved yet, but I detect that they are beginning to second-guess themselves on whether or not they have yet got it right. I hope they will move.</p>

To negotiate you have to have some powers, otherwise nobody will take you seriously. The Legal Services Board must have substantial powers. As I understood the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, just now, he seemed to say that in terms of sanctions you should move straight from a situation where there is some sort of relatively mild public censure to one where there is takeover, with no intervening sanction. Surely that cannot be what he is advocating&#151;either in terms of this amendment, in relation to restricting the ability to fine to where there is a direction being breached, or in terms of the next group of amendments, which would seek to delete the power to fine entirely, which seems to be where the noble Lord was a few minutes ago. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said explicitly that that was his ultimate and preferred aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07012339000207"></a>Even under the present circumstances there is an ability to fine&#151;circumstances which are well short of directions. The Legal Services Complaints Commissioner has relatively recently fined the Law Society for a persistent failure to deal with complaints handling sensibly. In other words, those that will be front-line approved regulators have some form in this respect. The fine needs to be available when there is a failure to conduct themselves effectively. A range of sanctions is provided within this legislation, as it is in respect of many regulators. Moving from a relatively mild public admonishment&#151;a tap on the wrist&#151;to a complete takeover of the role of the front-line regulator if the breach was persisted in, does not seem to be sensible regulation and would be in breach of many of the principles of better regulation that we have seen in other fields in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07012339000208"></a>This idea that we should remove, or seriously restrict, the ability to fine a priori would be almost to ride a coach and horses through the intent of the Bill.</p>

It is not acting in the interests of the consumer to suggest that a fine will strengthen the consumer&#146;s interest. It is something that is foreign to our system of appeal on these matters. The continuing attempt on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, to suggest that there is an inevitable opposition between lawyers and consumers is beside the point.

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07012345000002"></a>My objective in intervening in these debates is to ensure that the voice of the consumer is heard and that the structure that we put in place acts in the best interests of the legal profession as well. Ultimately, the legal profession depends on the confidence, trust and good experience of its clients and of society as a whole. At the moment, I am afraid that it does not have that confidence and trust to the degree that any of us would like. I hope that the Bill will help to achieve that. I believe that if the LSB has theoretical strong powers, it will reach an accommodation with the front-line regulators that will improve the profession&#146;s performance, which its recent history suggests it needs. That, surely, is the objective of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07012345000003"></a>The role of potential fines, as with any regulator, is important. All regulators use very sparingly the power to fine. Ultimately, it is not the Law Society, the front-line regulators or even the members of the profession who bear the cost of that fine but the consumer. That applies whether we are talking about the gas, electricity or any other market. Fines feed their way through to the consumer. I do not want the prospect of anybody in the system operating a policy of imposing reckless fines on anything that moves. That is the last thing we want. But we want a strong Legal Services Board which can inculcate in the front-line regulators greater respect for the position of consumers and greater concern for their interests. I hope that nobody in the Committee disagrees with those objectives.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, does not like lawyers, the Bar or the Bar Council. He has no use for approved regulators&#151;he thinks they are all no use. He wants to destroy the authority of self-regulation in our profession because he does not like it. You have only to listen to him. One way he thinks he will do it is by imposing fines. He wants a strong board. He has given no justification yet for imposing a fine because there is no board and nobody has given a direction.</p>

There is absolutely no need for the noble Lord&#146;s suggestions and approach. I support the amendment.

There is a difference between the supervisor and those being supervised.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07012345000007"></a>I agree that differences should be resolved by agreement where possible. My noble friend Lord Whitty, the noble Lords, Lord Campbell of Alloway, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, Lord Kingsland, and all Members of the Committee who have spoken in this debate would agree with that. We also know that that may happen in most circumstances but not in all. Whereas the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, was concerned that we have put a lot of structure in the Bill, in my view, the clearer we are about what is available to the Legal Services Board, the better for all concerned. Clarity about the powers is important; then everyone knows what is available and what could happen. That is fair and proper.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07012345000008"></a>Committee Members were concerned that this was an unusual power, but they will know that the Financial Services Authority and Ofgem also have that power and, as my noble friend Lord Whitty said, the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner currently has the power. Much was made of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, so I took the opportunity to look up the functions of CHRE, which are very different from the type of body that we are describing, so the comparison does not work effectively. The CHRE promotes the interests of patients and best practice, reports annually to Parliament, promotes co-operation and consistency, develops principles of good regulation and advises Ministers. They are very important objectives, but different from the case before us. Therefore, my first proposition is that the power to fine is available in a regulatory framework and should be clearly available in these particular circumstances.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07012345000009"></a>Having said that, I understand to a degree the concerns raised about how that power is exercised. We have talked a lot already today and yesterday about Clause 3(3) and both the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, and I recorded that subsection in <I>Hansard</I> so I will desist from repeating it. But the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, seeks to go further by constraining the circumstances in which that power could be exercised, specifically in Amendment No. 61. To remind ourselves of that, the noble Lord proposes that the power should be restricted to where the LSB has first issued a direction to an approved regulator under Clause 31 and,</p>
<ul><a name="07012345000030"></a>&#147;the approved regulator has failed to comply with&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012345000029"></a>that direction.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07012345000010"></a>I understand the intention to ensure that there is a clear indication of what the Legal Services Board sees as a failure. I also understand that the need for assurance is particularly relevant where the approved regulator may, as the noble Lord said in his opening remarks, have separated the regulatory and representative functions we require under Clause 29, and as such, does not have direct control over the exercise of regulatory functions by its regulatory arm. I have some sympathy with the Committee about that.</p>

<a name="70123-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07012345000011"></a>However, I remain concerned that where the regulators do have control over matters it might be appropriate for the LSB to be able to fine without first issuing directions. I am making a distinction in my mind between those matters over which the regulator has direct control and those over which it does not. In particular, one might say that, as in Clause 29, the proper separation of the functions of regulatory and representative functions and the proper resourcing of regulatory arms are clearly a direct responsibility of the approved regulator. That is where it might be appropriate to move to a fine if that is the right thing to do.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07012345000012"></a>In Amendment No. 62 the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is trying to further restrict the use of the power to fine to situations in which the LSB is satisfied that the matter cannot be adequately addressed by use of any of the other powers available to it&#151;such as the setting of performance targets, issuing a direction or a statement of public censure, if I dare mention that last point. I understand what the noble Lord seeks to achieve. Indeed, it is best practice for a regulator to be satisfied that any sanction that it seeks to apply is appropriate. Again, Clause 3 provides for that and I would expect the board to take full account of it. But I am not persuaded to go as far as the noble Lord wishes me to go under Amendment No. 62, by putting such a responsibility in the Bill, as I do not want to fetter the LSB to exercise effective oversight regulation as completely as the amendment would do. While I accept that it is a condition in respect of an intervention directions and deauthorisation, these are more serious and intrusive powers. Therefore, we do not consider the same threshold should apply to the power to fine.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07012345000013"></a>But I should like to look at these points again and, in particular, the points that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised under Amendment No. 61 in the manner that I described&#151;which is about the ability of the regulator to have direct control over particular issues and whether, when that is not available, those circumstances dictate that a direction might be appropriate first. So if the noble Lord agrees I shall take away Amendments Nos. 61 and 62. I have made it clear that I do not want to go as far as Amendment No. 62 at this point, but I am interested in what the noble Lord seeks to do, at least in part, under Amendment No. 61, without taking away the power to fine which is important and already available in other forms of regulatory regime. We want to have that capacity available but we may need to think a little further to be clear about situations in which there is no direct control. I hope that noble Lords will accept my willingness to do that and to come back with my further thoughts on that.</p>

The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, would make it the last resort, only to be used if the other remedies that the Government have proposed for powers for the LSB have failed. I encourage the Minister to develop her thinking along those lines.</p>

The point that comes to my mind is that &#147;last resort&#148; is difficult to define and that there may be circumstances in which, because of how the regulator has behaved in other areas in which directions have been issued, and so on, the supervisory regulator decides that a fine is actually the most appropriate thing to give. I cannot think of what those circumstances might be and I am not going to give false examples, because it might suggest that I expect that to happen when I hope that it will not.

Publicly fining and publicly censuring are very strong powers. To fine a regulatory body would be a very tough step.

However, I return to Clause 36 itself, on financial penalties. Although the Minister has moved, one further small step needs to be taken to meet, I believe, with the approval of the All-Party Select Committee. The step involves trying to visualise the circumstances in which these financial penalties will be levied by one regulator against another. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, prompts me to put the record straight. He gave the example of the Law Society being fined by the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner because she was dissatisfied with the plan that the Law Society had prepared for handling complaints. Once again, I declare my interest as a member of the Law Society and a practising solicitor.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07012351000004"></a>The Law Society had delegated responsibility for the plan to its independent consumer complaints board. Indeed, on some of the issues between the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner and the consumer complaints board, the Law Society agreed with the commissioner. Nevertheless, because the society had delegated control of complaints-handling to the independent body, it was unable to ensure that the plan met the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner&#146;s requirements. Thus, the Law Society was fined for matters it could not control. I had to put the record straight in light of what the noble Lord said.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07012351000005"></a>The approach of the Joint Select Committee keeps returning to the point about partnership. We have to ask ourselves, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland did in the debate on the last amendment: who will pay this fine? Undoubtedly, as my noble and learned friend has just pointed out, it will be consumers of legal services who pay the fine. All those who are regulated are also consumers of those legal services. One has to ask: where are the precedents for good, smooth working between regulators which allow a supervisory regulator to impose a financial penalty on an approved regulator in the circumstances set out in the Bill? I hope that the noble Baroness will not only read again the joint select committee report&#151;which I know she takes home with her every night in order to consider all these amendments&#151;but reflect further. Are we setting up the right structure? We want to get away from this confrontation to reach unanimity on the context in which we are going to put the public and consumer interest right at the heart of this Bill.</p>

The problem arises when one body fines another body such a substantial amount that it eventually falls on the consumer, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said. That may not be a very happy situation, which is why I suggested when we were discussing the previous amendment that the fining power&#151;I agree that the regulatory body must have some teeth&#151;should be seen as a matter of last resort. I shall not develop the matter further. I shall wait to hear what the Minister thinks after reading, bi-nightly, the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07012351000008"></a>I understand and completely accept the principle behind wanting the supervisory regulator and the approved regulator to work as closely together as possible. I have perhaps greater faith than noble Lords in their ability to develop an appropriate working relationship to provide the right kind of regulatory approach that will help support the objectives behind the legislation. I hope that we will be able to achieve that; I am confident that we will. I am also hopeful that the powers invested in the Legal Services Board will not be used. However, those powers need to exist because we are talking about regulation in the interests of the consumer, the public or the profession&#151;one can argue which one. Parliament&#146;s purpose in looking at this matter is to agree that regulation is appropriate. I was pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, say that the body needs to have teeth. Teeth are important, but they should be understood and used appropriately. I gave an example to illustrate why I do not want to constrain the body in the way that the noble Lord has just mentioned, but I have also volunteered to take away for consideration Amendment No. 61. We will have further opportunities in your Lordships' House and beyond to discuss it.</p>

Here, in respect of the power to fine, and exceptionally, a right of statutory review is granted in the Bill; but it appears to have been given rather grudgingly. As drafted, the right of appeal available to an approved regulator against a penalty under Clause 38 remains very limited. Provision is made by Clause 38(2) for an approved

<p><a name="07012351000083"></a>This statutory review is combined with Clause 38(7), which provides:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07012351000085"></a>&#147;Except as provided by this section, the validity of a penalty is not to be questioned by any legal proceedings whatever&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07012351000014"></a>Apart from any other defect, this ouster clause is of questionable compatibility with the human rights convention. Is it really the case that an approved regulator or licensed body that sought judicial review of a penalty after the expiry of 42 days, but within three months, would be held to be excluded from doing so? And would the grounds for statutory review of the penalty include any grounds on which judicial review could otherwise be sought?</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07012351000015"></a>We have sought in Amendment No. 63 to include grounds for judicial review as one of the grounds for appeal under Clause 38(2), making it absolutely clear that all the remedies that would have been available under judicial review will be available under statutory review. Amendment No. 64, which relates to Clause 38(7), seeks to remove from the face of the Bill the ouster clause&#151;that is, the clause which says,</p>

It is clear that Clause 38(7) is an ouster clause. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that it is of doubtful validity in the light of the Human Rights Act. I hope that the Minister will look at that.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07012351000018"></a>The statutory right of appeal is, moreover, limited. You can appeal on the basis that the decision was ultra vires; that the requirements of Section 37 have not been complied with; and that it is unreasonable&#151;but only in the amount of fine or the time in which it is payable. What is left out is a right of appeal on the grounds that it was unreasonable to impose the penalty in the first place. It is an extremely important omission. It is not covered. I am sorry if the Minister missed what I was saying&#151;I think she did. The unreasonableness of the financial penalty is confined to amount or time to pay, not its imposition in the first place. It seems to be a gap. It ought to be open to a regulatory body to go to the court and say, &#147;We do not care about the amount or how long there is to pay it; it should never have been imposed at all. It should never have been imposed at all. It is an unreasonable decision&#148;. That is something that must be addressed.</p>

Suffice to say, we consider that the financial penalty warranted a specific reference and ability for statutory right of appeal in the Bill. We believe that that is also consistent with precedents in other regulatory areas.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1036"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1036</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70123-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07012351000020"></a>We are sure that, with this provision, the court will be in no doubt that the amount of the penalty may be questioned. That could apply even in cases where, although the amount is not so manifestly disproportionate that it could not be the act of a reasonable regulator, it may none the less be too high. The alternative would be to leave approved regulators to a remedy in judicial review. In that case it would still be possible to challenge the imposition of a penalty, and potentially even the amount. Yet, as noble Lords will know, for a challenge on the latter to succeed, it is likely that the amount would have to be more conspicuously unreasonable. And, of course, all challenges would be subject to permission. It is important to lay out those differences on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07012351000021"></a>Apart from those differences, the grounds on which an appeal against a fine may be brought are already akin to the grounds for judicial review. If the board exceeds its powers, fails to follow proper procedure or acts unreasonably in imposing a penalty, it may be challenged under Clause 38. I think that goes some way to answering the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07012351000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, seeks to add a further ground incorporating any ground that would find a claim in judicial review. I would argue that that is not necessary because it duplicates grounds that already exist as part of the existing appeals process which has been set out.</p>

<a name="70123-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07012351000023"></a>I turn to the second element of the amendment. In this clause we are seeking to avoid any duplication or confusion of procedures. Subsection (7), the ouster clause, sensibly pre-empts the possibility of a parallel challenge being brought by way of judicial review proceedings. It would not do to create a situation where two challenges could be brought on the same decision on substantially the same grounds. I note that Clause 38(7) does not prevent the case proceeding to the Court of Appeal in the event that that is appropriate. The provision exists not to deny rights but to ensure that we are clear about certainty and expediency and to ensure that there is one route through and not two parallel routes. There is case law in the European Court of Human Rights on which I am happy to write to noble Lords, to explain it. But that is the purpose of the provision. It is intended not to deny rights but to say that there is one way through. I hope that the noble Lord will reflect on that explanation.</p>

I am, of course, aware that, where there is a statutory appeal system which gives the appellant all the opportunities that he would have had had he alternatively applied for judicial review, in many circumstances the effect would be to oust judicial review; but that is quite different from the use of an ouster clause, itself. Although judicial review is often denied in those circumstances, the administrative court would still wish to have the option to ensure that the remedies provided by the statutory system adequately covered the remedies available in judicial review.</p>

As long as the noble Baroness can confidently assure me that all the remedies that would have been available to somebody who had applied for judicial review as an alternative would be available under the statutory review scheme in Clause 38, I can feel more relaxed about Amendment No. 64.

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07012351000036"></a>In this part of the Bill, powers of discipline are given to the LSB. It can impose performance targets and monitoring, but the Bill requires only that the board must consider any representations that are duly made before taking action. When it comes to the section concerning directions, there is a safeguard in Clause 33, but it is a very poor one: the board has to make an application to the High Court when an approved regulator is said to have complied with the direction that is made, but nothing there gives the approved regulator any chance of challenging that direction in court.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07012351000037"></a>We have already had a debate about censure and, as I understood it, the Minister conceded that judicial review was fully available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07012351000038"></a>We then come to the subject of penalties, which I should like to put into some context. These penalties, or methods of discipline, will be used in highly controversial situations. It was highly controversial of the ombudsman to impose a large fine on the Law Society in the way that we recently discussed, and it will be highly controversial for the LSB to start giving directions and censuring the Law Society, the Bar Council and any other approved regulatory body, and even more controversial to fine them. We are not dealing with situations where everyone gets along well and is happy but those where recourse to the courts becomes necessary. No one wants that to happen; everyone hopes that things can be sorted out by agreement.</p>

In the mean time, I look for the ranks of lay consumers behind the Government eagerly pressing this Bill on the public.

The amendment repeats many of the arguments from that lengthy discussion, and they do not all need to be repeated today. It was encouraging to hear the Minister confirm yesterday that she agrees with the principle behind these amendments.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07012351000067"></a>This particular amendment relates to statements of policy issued by the board. It would require any statements of policy to accept that primary regulatory responsibility lies with the approved regulators and not with the board. As well as the primacy of the approved regulators, the amendment again reinforces our wish for the supervisory approach, ensuring that the board uses its powers only when absolutely necessary and that its first action must be to seek an informal resolution of the problem before exercising its statutory powers. These are important principles to establish and we were heartened to hear that the Government were pleased with them; but they must be stated explicitly so that it is clear from the Bill that that is the Government&#146;s intention. I beg to move.</p>

I must explain our concerns to the Minister in these terms: that the Bill is cast in a way that would enable the Legal Services Board to set out detailed templates for the way in which it considers approved regulators should discharge their functions, in effect to micromanage them; exactly the opposite of what the Minister says she would like.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07012351000069"></a>It is perfectly possible under the Bill as presently set out for the Legal Services Board to substitute the board&#146;s view for the approved regulators even where the approved regulator&#146;s approach is plainly within the range of reasonable decisions. We are all agreed that it would be damaging if the Legal Services Board acted in that way and as we noted in the Joint Committee the cost estimates are based on the assumption that the Legal Services Board will act as a light touch regulator, so there we are.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07012351000070"></a>Why does not the Bill reflect the Minister&#146;s words and in particular the policy of the lead Minister, Bridget Prentice?

I am not sure that reading that I have continued to move is necessarily the way to enhance my career, sunny uplands or not, from the noble Lord&#146;s point of view. I should begin by saying that of course I have committed to look at all the issues again, but I wanted to place on the record&#151;it is important that we reflect on the matter&#151;why we think we have captured this but with the proviso that I already mentioned.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07012351000076"></a>When we discussed Amendment No. 33, as the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Hunt, mentioned, we said that the board needs to work in partnership with those it regulates. The Government&#146;s stated policy is that the responsibility for day-to-day regulation should rest with the approved regulators. It is one of the key benefits of what has been described as a B+ model&#151;that the experience and knowledge of approved regulators will be preserved within the new framework&#151;and one of the reasons we agreed was Sir David&#146;s recommendation that that was the best way to reform the legal service.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07012351000077"></a>For that model to work, we need a strong and independent oversight regulator that does not second guess and micromanage those approved regulators that are performing their functions well. We believe that the Bill as drafted does establish the Legal Services Board as a proportionate regulator. We have talked a number of times today, and indeed yesterday, about the statutory duty in Clause 3 to ensure that the board has regard to better-regulation principles, including that the activities should be proportionate and targeted only at cases where action is needed, and be accountable to Parliament for how it exercises its functions. Through Clause 48 the board must issue policy statements about how it will use its powers; for example, the power to issue directions. Any policy statement made under the provision can be brought into force only after a draft has been published and the board has considered representations made to it about that draft.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07012351000078"></a>We think that that provision is important as a way of ensuring clarity and transparency about how the board will exercise its functions and to give approved regulators&#151;I return to the point about working collaboratively&#151;the opportunity to inform any policy. Paragraph (b) of the amendment limits the circumstances in which the board can take action where the approved regulator is acting or refusing to act unreasonably. It is a high hurdle, which would make it difficult for the board to function as effectively as we would like and  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1042"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1042</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to exercise its powers in circumstances where the regulator is failing. There may be circumstances where a regulator is acting in a way that cannot be said to be a way in which a reasonable regulator would act, but there is an adverse effect on the objectives that should be addressed.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07012351000079"></a>In this case, it is right for the board to take action, so I would argue that the existing thresholds are the right ones and we do not need to duplicate them in Clause 48. It is to be expected that the board will be in regular communication with the approved regulators in its role as oversight regulator; indeed, it is likely that policy statements under Clause 48 will be the appropriate medium where the board sets out its approach and that relationship more formally, similar to the way in which the Financial Services Authority operates. It uses those statements to clarify its role in relation to the firms that it regulates.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07012351000080"></a>I hope that that gives a greater sense and supports what the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Hunt, said about not micromanaging and the relationship that needs to exist. I have already indicated that I will reflect whether we have that right in the Bill as it stands but it is our intention to have got it right in the way that the noble Lords would wish.</p>

However, I am slightly concerned by her analogy with the Financial Services Authority because Sir David Clementi said that the Legal Services Board should not in any way reflect the structure of that body. Perhaps I can encapsulate my argument in this way. It is all well and good for the Minister to say what she has just said and for the Government to say what they said in their response to the Joint Committee report, but when the Legal Services Board is established it will not look to those words. It will not look to the Government&#146;s response or to the speech that the Minister has just made; it will look to the words of the statute, as of course it must. Accordingly, if we want the Legal Services Board to act as a supervisory regulator rather than as the lead regulator, it is so important to introduce language to the Bill that makes that intention clear.</p>

<a name="70123-0007.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07012351000082"></a>I welcome the fact that the Minister has said she is going to look at all this. If she does that and does not come forward with the words proposed by my noble friend&#151;I leave him to respond to the amendment&#151;I hope she comes forward with some words that would put into the Bill exactly what she has just said.</p>

That is the critical distinction. In moving his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is saying to me, &#147;You have explained what you wish to achieve&#148;&#151;there is nothing between any of us on that&#151;&#147;but will you please look again at whether that is what you achieve in the Bill?&#148;. My view is that we may have done that, but the noble Lord&#146;s view is that we may not have done that. We need to consider that. I am not asking anyone to rely on my words to interpret the function; people should go to the statute.</p>

Some of what I wanted to raise might have been better raised on the Question whether the clause stand part. The provisions of Clause 48 impose a mandatory duty on the board to issue statements of policy in seven particular respects. That could create a whole apparatus of guidance that goes far beyond the exercise of discretion to intervene where there is a perceived weakness in the existing regulatory provision. It appears that the board is being invited to do what the noble Baroness herself is clearly and sensibly reluctant to do, which is to spell out the circumstances in which these various powers may be exercised. If that happens, arguments will be made by the regulator about whether the supervision by the Legal Services Board gave no indication about the circumstances that arose in the policy statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07012357000003"></a>In itself, that is suggestive of a very wide-ranging and detailed role, which I suspect is not necessary. Clearly, it is sensible for the supervisory board to have an interchange of ideas and considerations with the appointed regulators, but this is much more. This is almost the statute book being issued by the supervisory board&#151;by the Legal Services Board. The power to issue not just simple guidance when the Legal Services Board considers it necessary, but a duty to issue statements of policy right across the board in this way, is a very heavy burden indeed. I hesitate to reuse the word that I used, which caused some eyebrows to be raised in an earlier debate&#151;incubus&#151;but that is how it strikes me.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07012357000004"></a>The motivation behind the amendment seems to me quite a helpful indication that these policy statements should not have that encyclopaedic nature; they should not necessarily be regarded as all-encompassing.

If the Minister stands by that, something must clearly be said in the Bill about the supervisory role of the Legal Services Board and the primary regulatory role of the approved regulators if the Legal Services Board is to reflect the philosophy that she has expounded in Committee on more than one occasion. Otherwise, the Legal Services Board will be free to read what it will into this Bill and will be in no way obliged to take note of the Minister&#146;s many statements in these debates about what the proper relationship between these two statutory authorities ought to be. In the light of the Minister&#146;s reply, the importance of something in the Bill reflecting her underlying philosophy becomes extremely important to the Opposition.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is perfectly at liberty to interpret that as suggesting to the Opposition that there needs to be more in the Bill. I have already undertaken to see whether that is reflected in the Bill, but that is not the only mechanism whereby we have set out, in many circumstances, how we expect particular operations to be conducted by bodies set up by the Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="07012357000023"></a><b><a name="70123-0008.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07012357000045"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> I take this opportunity to acknowledge with gratitude the reply to the earlier amendment dealing with some points which might have been better raised in this debate. The obligation on the board to prepare and issue statements of policy with respect to the exercise of its functions under Sections 30, 31, 34, 36, 40, 45 and 75 does not suggest a light touch. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to engage with what must be included in some of these policy statements&#151;such as, in subsection (3)(a), the extent to which a penalty is being imposed with regard to the deliberation or recklessness of the action of the frontline regulator&#151;in the hypothetical circumstances which might arise.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07012357000024"></a>This clause militates against the Government&#146;s argument that it is intended that the role be exercised with a light touch. The board is being given almost legislative functions. They are described as policy statements, but they are clearly intended to guide and be relied on by others in the front line. I cannot see this being accomplished without a massive bureaucracy in support. What goes into and is left out of those statements will require very careful consideration. What goes in will be more than an indication; it will be taken as a rule. What is left out will be regarded as secondary. If there is an issue between the two bodies&#151;the front-line regulator and the Legal Services Board&#151;the absence of a reference to it in the policy statement will militate in favour of it being regarded as something that was not of such importance. That may therefore diminish the effectiveness of the Legal Services Board.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07012357000025"></a>The clause is quite troubling. I hope that, in reviewing the matters raised under the previous amendment, the Minister will give some thought to perhaps articulating how these statements of policy are to be prepared and what their role might be and what they are anticipated to encompass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07012357000027"></a>The purpose of setting that out is no more than to ensure that we enhance the transparency of what the board must do.

</ul>
<a name="70123-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07012376000006"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 106 and 148 derive from concerns raised with the Opposition by the trade mark and patent attorneys. These amendments seek to keep practising fees separate from a regulator&#146;s other assets. As I understand it, the logic is that, while there are severe restrictions on the positive use of fee income or enjoyment of profit, the liability for the levy to the Legal Services Board appears to extend to all a regulator&#146;s assets, including its non-regulatory business. The view of the trade mark and patent attorneys is that it is inequitable that a regulator and its owners should bear the burden, but not the benefit, of regulatory activity. Thus, Amendment No. 106 proposes that a regulator&#146;s income should be ring-fenced, while Amendment No. 148 suggests that recovery of the board&#146;s levy as a debt should be limited to the regulatory income of the regulator.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07012376000007"></a>The Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys provides an illustration of the problems that could arise in recovering the levy. It is a private body limited by guarantee that performs regulatory and non-regulatory functions. If the levy can be recovered against all its assets, that would mean that the assets of the business, including income and capital assets derived from non-regulatory and representative sources, are vulnerable, even though, as a regulator, the institute and its members are precluded by Clause 50(2) from realising any financial benefit from any regulatory activity. The result is that private persons or businesses are expected to guarantee a levy to the state with no possibility of a corresponding benefit in return. Therefore, it is argued that it is only reasonable that the recovery of the levy should be limited to funds ring-fenced by the proposed subsection in Amendment No. 148. I beg to move.</p>

However, I hope that he will agree that the precise nature of how that separation happens and the accompanying financial arrangements that might

It should be for the board to determine how the arrangements apply in each case, and, in accordance with its duties under the Bill, to act in accordance with best regulatory practice, including proportionality. I believe that that is best worked out between the supervisory regulator and the regulators themselves.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07012376000009"></a>The board is already under a duty to make detailed rules on a number of matters, including the purposes for which practising fees may be raised. It must also set out internal governance rules under Clause 29 to ensure that the representative and regulatory functions are properly separated. However, it may not always be appropriate to set out a separate requirement that practising fees are separated from other assets in every case.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07012376000010"></a>It is important to recognise that although practising fees are raised mainly for purely regulatory purposes, some functions are more of a public interest nature than a purely regulatory nature where it might be appropriate for both the regulatory and the representative arms to be involved. Functions could include the promotion of relations between the approved regulator and other national&#151;or even international&#151;bodies, Governments or the legal professions of other jurisdictions; or participation in law reform. It would not be appropriate to set out a requirement that could restrict or prevent an appropriate and efficient distribution of resources. I am sure that that is not what the noble Lord had in mind.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07012376000011"></a>There may be smaller approved regulators that carry out only a regulatory function for which a financial separation on the lines of this amendment would not be appropriate. We consider that maximum financial flexibility is needed to ensure that the different types and sizes of regulators can operate effectively and efficiently and to recognise the different roles they play&#151;an example of which I hope I have given the noble Lord, on which he can reflect.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07012376000012"></a>On Amendment No. 148, although I would expect money owed on the levy to be paid from practising fee income, and Clause 50(4)(b) already provides that the levy is one of the purposes for which practising fees may be charged, I do not want to set that out in the Bill. We do not want to set out a statutory requirement that restricts the flexibility of the approved regulators to meet a debt in the way best suited to their financial arrangements&#151;and it would be a debt. The requirement might also mean that an approved regulator could be forced to divert funds raised from practising fees away from essential regulatory functions when other assets or sources of income would be the least damaging way to meet the costs of regulation.</p>

<a name="70123-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07012376000013"></a>It is unusual for legislation to restrict the way in which moneys owed may be recovered, and we do not think that we should make an exception in this case. I start again from the principle that we hope that these powers are not used; but if they are, we would perhaps be failing the regulators if we restricted the ways in which they could use their assets to those in the amendments. I ask the noble Lord to reflect on that reason and withdraw the amendment.</p>

The Bill requires approved regulators to strictly separate two activities&#151;the regulatory activity and the representative activity&#151;yet, when it comes to financial levies by the Legal Services Board, all the assets of the institution that provides the approved regulator, whether committed to regulation or not, are vulnerable to levy by the Legal Services Board.

Once again, I hope she will be able to find some way of indicating to it that it should respond to this situation sympathetically because, in principle, the board ought to address levies only to the regulatory arm of the approved regulator. I can understand why it is very attractive for a creditor to try to seize all the available assets, but if a proportion of those assets has nothing to do with regulation, there is a certain logic in not allowing those assets to become vulnerable.</p>

The difficulty with the amendments is that, in a sense, they are another way up from the point the noble Lord is making; they would prevent the regulators being fined using their assets as they think best.

Two matters strike me as important. First, the partnership approach to which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, referred, should be looked at properly. Secondly, proportionality has a role to play as well. When looking at these matters, the Legal Services Board should be expected to behave proportionately. It should not look at all the assets and think, &#147;Those can be taken&#148;, for precisely the reasons that the noble Lord gave. So the matter revolves around the relationship between the Legal Services Board, the regulator and the regulated, and the requirement on the Legal Services Board to behave in a proportionate way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07012376000026"></a>The motivation for the amendment comes from the interests of regulators who operate outside the legal services area. The issue is, as I understand it, that there is no mechanism for dialogue between approved regulators and external regulators such as, for example, the Financial Services Authority or the Institute of Chartered Accountants. This is already an important point in a situation, for example, where an accountant is employed by a law firm. Following this legislation it will become doubly so because of the creation of the new alternative business structure regime, where there will inevitably be more interaction between the various professions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07012376000027"></a>The problem, as I understand it, is that the Bill as currently drafted allows an affected person&#151;in other words, a licensed individual or a firm&#151;to make an application to the board in the case of regulatory conflict. There is a similar capability between the various approved regulators on the same ground. But the Bill does not allow any mechanism whatever for an external regulatory body as defined in the Bill to address the problem of conflicting regulation. We believe there should be the means for such a dialogue to take place. That is the background to the amendments.</p>

The Bill as it stands puts licensed bodies at a disadvantage when they happen also to come under the jurisdiction of a regulator not covered under the Bill, as will be the case for many of the new alternative business structures. This could have the consequence of increased cost and potentially reduced competition for consumers&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, please note&#151;which we know well by now the Government are eager to avoid. In short, what makes the amendments desirable is that it is less costly and more appropriate if conflicts can be resolved between the regulators themselves. I beg to move.</p>

The amendments proposed by the noble Lord are in keeping with the spirit of these existing duties. He is seeking, as we are, to ensure that legal and non-legal regulators are encouraged to co-operate and to work together towards better regulation. The amendments seek to take this duty a stage further in that they require approved regulators not only to take steps at a general level to pre-empt conflicts, but also to consider, on a case-by-case basis, any specific problems that external regulators might bring to their attention.</p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07012376000030"></a>The changes would also highlight further the fact that the board can play a role in resolving external conflicts where all parties consent to this arrangement and it is within their power to do so. The principle behind the amendments is absolutely sound. It creates the potential for professional services to become more integrated. If the benefits of this integration are to be realised, regulators have to be able to co-operate with one another. Indeed, the Joint Committee recognised the importance of guarding against regulatory conflict, particularly in ABS firms, and this is what we have sought to achieve in this part of the Bill.</p>

We recognise that the powers given to the board in Clause 61 must be part of the Bill as a safety net; but it is essential that they are restricted to that. It must be the case that this power is only used when there is no other approved regulator that could regulate the activity in question. That approach is consistent with the policy of minimum intervention by the board and with the professional bodies taking lead responsibility in regulating wherever possible. I am confident that the Government will be sympathetic to this aim, but nevertheless would like an assurance to that effect; and of course, if possible, would like it expressly stated in the Bill that this is a last resort power.

We want the board to remain an oversight regulator, except in those really exceptional cases where it has no choice other than to regulate itself. I agree with him that, before seeking designation, the board should be expected to explore any viable alternatives. We have always anticipated that where an alternative approved regulator exists, that should be the board&#146;s primary and preferred course of action. We think the Bill takes account of that.

That may or may not be right, although I do not like the idea of this Chamber passing a clause that allows the Government by order to amend any Act of Parliament. My concern is increased by the words, &#147;or any other body&#148;. It may well be that the Minister could assist me in understanding what that means.

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07012376000056"></a>As the noble Lord says, Clause 68 allows the Secretary of State to modify any of the functions of an approved regulator or, in that great phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="07012376000125"></a>&#147;any other body (other than the Board)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012376000105"></a>The purpose of empowering the Secretary of State, the Lord Chancellor, in that way is to ensure that approved regulators, including those who are &#147;creatures of statute&#148;, as the term has it, can easily adapt to the changing legal sector, and that their regulatory powers are efficient and effective. Indeed, the noble Lord addressed the scope of that at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07012376000057"></a>The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has reviewed this, as you would expect it to do, in the light of the supplementary memorandum we sent on 7 December. The noble Lord should have a copy of that, but if he does not, I will ensure that he does; it may cast more light on this clause. The committee&#146;s report found the delegation&#146;s prospective power to the Secretary of State and the power to amend prerogative instruments to be appropriate. The finding was reached because the committee was persuaded that we need this to create a level playing field for all approved regulators, allowing the functions of a statutory body such as the Law Society to be altered as easily as the functions of a non-statutory body. &#147;Any other body&#148; applies to bodies that are applying to be approved regulators but are not yet, and which need statutory changes to allow them to become approved regulators, or indeed licensing authorities, under the Bill. That is the purpose. If that is not a complete answer, I will supplement it in any way the noble Lord likes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07012376000059"></a>I am still worried, though, about what she calls the statutory creature. If indeed the clause is limited in the way she has described, the wording should read, &#147;or any other body that has applied to become an approved regulator&#148;. The phrase &#147;or any other body&#148; is very wide and open. I have read that the Government have persuaded the Committee, which I am slightly surprised about, given the phraseology. But the Minister has answered my point and promised to reflect on the questions I have asked. In that spirit, I accept what she has said and look forward to hearing further from her.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70123-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07012376000064"></a>The noble Lord said: We now&#151;and at last, some of your Lordships might say&#151;reach Part 5 of the Bill, which deals with alternative business structures. Amendment No. 108 is the first amendment to that part of the Bill. It is a probing amendment. The approach of the amendment is motivated by timing, the key words in the amendment being, &#147;on an incremental basis&#148;. This follows from the recommendation of the Joint Committee, chaired by my noble friend Lord Hunt, that there should not be a sudden explosion of ABSs on to the market. They should be introduced gradually. At this stage we therefore urge the Minister to address the concerns that we, and many of those who have taken an interest in this matter, have over-perceived potential problems. </p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07012376000065"></a>There is a general uncertainty about what effect these new structures will have on the market. In particular, there is widespread concern about their impact on access to justice. This concern is expressed, most generally, by a fear that the new ABS organisations will cherry pick the most financially attractive areas of law, leaving those that are often subsidised by more attractive work to be either abandoned by high street solicitors or simply dealt with in a perfunctory manner.</p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07012376000066"></a>There is also worry about the headline that one has seen more than once in the last few months of one-stop shops or Tesco law. These are portrayed as providing significant benefits to consumers; but we have no idea how that might affect the quality of legal advice given in the one-stop shop. What views do the Government have about that?</p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07012376000067"></a>Then there is the international dimension. We are one of the most successful countries in the world at exporting legal services. I have no statistical evidence which would prove the case, but I suspect that we are probably the most successful country in the world at exporting legal services. What effect are the new ABSs going to have on our international reputation? It is very important that whatever we do, it does not damage our ability to sell our services abroad.</p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07012376000068"></a>There is another distinct issue about our international outreach. Certain ABS structures might be regarded in other countries as being unethical or indeed be illegal in other territories or jurisdictions. How will we grapple with that problem? There are a range of issues, about which it is still unclear as to the effect that ABSs might have.</p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07012376000069"></a>This is a probing amendment. We are probing to ascertain whether the Government have any plans for assessing or monitoring the impact of ABSs once they begin to be licensed and whether they will have any safeguards in place against any of these potential concerns. The amendment is not in itself the answer. We have put forward two or three amendments of our own&#151;more detailed amendments which we hope your  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1056"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1056</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lordships will discuss later. They are different ways of achieving the same objective but our philosophy towards ABSs is an incremental one. We believe that the Government and the Legal Services Board should begin slowly and deliberately and, as a result of accumulating experience should then, if that experience is positive, become more ambitious. But we would be wholly opposed to any immediate licensing system which did not take account of the experience of the first few ABSs that were launched.</p>

<a name="70123-0009.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07012376000070"></a>We believe that the Joint Committee said some very wise things about the ABSs and I want to conclude my remarks with a quotation from its report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="07012376000120"></a>&#147;The true impact of ABS is not clear to us. Evidence has suggested that there may be an impact on both vulnerable consumers and those in particular geographical locations (for example, rural or isolated areas). Indeed, it may be that there are different impacts on those two areas. We have received no concrete evidence that access to justice will either be improved or reduced under ABS arrangements, but we are persuaded by some of the evidence suggesting that the reforms may reduce geographical availability. We consider that ABSs may reduce the number of access points for legal services and we see this as a potential problem. There is clearly an issue here and the only conclusion we are able to draw is that no-one can be sure how it will work out. We recognise that there may be a trade-off between the quality and accessibility of advice&#151;for example a small, high-street solicitor in a rural area may not be able to provide the specialist advice a client requires. We recommend that the Government amends the draft Bill to ensure that the impact of ABSs on access to justice, particularly in rural areas, informs the decision-making process that licensing an ABS firm&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70123-0009.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07012376000071"></a>On one particular, issue the Joint Committee has gone rather further than the incremental approach that I was outlining and has said, in terms, that it has real concerns about the impact of ABSs on the geographical disposition of legal services in England and Wales.

I believe that Part 5 of the Bill raises issues of a different order; it could have a very significant effect on access to justice. As I understand the purpose of the Bill, it is intended to increase access to justice and to improve the position of the consumer of legal services. In so far as that is the Bill&#146;s intention, I am sure that no noble Lord would want to do other than support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07012376000075"></a>For the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, which were indicated by the Joint Committee, this is an untried situation. Anyone who has in recent years had the responsibility of travelling around the country in the interests of the administration of justice and access to justice knows that there are real problems with the availability of legal services in the country as a whole. That is particularly true in parts of Wales, where I have heard much from high-street solicitors.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07012376000076"></a>There is no doubt that large businesses could provide legal services in a novel and interesting way. But that could&#151;unintentionally, perhaps&#151;have a devastating effect on those who have traditionally provided services in rural areas in particular. Great care has to be exercised to see that damage does not occur.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07012376000077"></a>In his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, indicated one way of providing some protection&#151;one way in which to square the circle. But I urge the Minister to accept that that is not the only way of achieving that objective. The licensing authority could be given guidance and direction in the Bill requiring it to pay appropriate respect to the importance of the issue the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised and which I seek to underline. I hope that the Minister will feel that she can take the clause away with a view to giving further consideration to this issue, particularly taking into account the concerns that have been expressed today as well as those of the Joint Committee.</p>

He has been sitting through these proceedings, listening carefully to every word. We, too, have listened very carefully to what he has just said. His description of what may happen to access to justice was one of the issues that deeply troubled the Joint Committee. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Kingsland read out paragraph 324, which encapsulates much of our concern. We were told by the Government that they, too, were concerned, but no amendment to signify any breakthrough in persuading the Government that the Bill as drafted could result in these dangers has yet been proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07012376000079"></a>It is important to remind the Minister that in his report, Sir David Clementi was much more cautious about the right way forward. I thank my noble friend for tabling a wide amendment that has allowed us to have a very important debate about alternative business structures. It gives us a chance to reflect on whether we are proceeding in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07012376000080"></a>In his 2004 report, Sir David Clementi recommended the facilitation of what he described as &#147;legal disciplinary practices&#148;, known as LDPs, allowing different kinds of lawyers to work together, with or without external ownership or management. He drew a clear distinction between LDPs and MDPs&#151;multi-disciplinary practices&#151;which bring together lawyers and other professionals to provide legal and other services to third parties. He concluded that the creation of LDPs would represent a major

Those are such important words. I think I speak for most noble Lords when I say that we are not yet persuaded that sufficient safeguards have been put in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07012376000081"></a>In another paragraph, the Joint Committee was unanimous in saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="07012376000121"></a>&#147;Given the level of uncertainty about the impact of ABS provisions we urge the Government to use &#145;less haste and more care&#146; and follow the Clementi Report in their approach. We recommend that the draft Bill be amended to ensure that the LSB takes a &#145;step-by-step&#146; approach to licensing ABSs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012376000106"></a>We set out four stages which could represent the right way forward, and continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="07012376000122"></a>&#147;If necessary, this gradual approach could be adopted by bringing the necessary provisions into force by order at different times&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012376000107"></a>I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the points made by my noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. It is so important that we get this right. In moving Amendment No. 108, my noble friend has given the noble Baroness an opportunity at this early stage, as we are debating alternative business structures, to put our fears at rest.</p>

Some of the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and others need to be addressed. I do not want to alarm the noble Lord, but I might actually support his Amendment No. 108C, which would require the licensing authority to look at some assessment of the impact of ABSs. I am particularly concerned about rural areas. Part of the procedure for approving alternative business structures might be to assess their impact more broadly. I do not particularly agree with the wording of the amendment because if matters have been validated through that procedure, there is no point in rationing the licences. But when individual applications are being considered, it is important that the wider impact is taken into account. This needs to be part of the Government&#146;s thinking and, on principle, I strongly support the provisions on ABSs.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07012376000084"></a>The principle behind the amendment, with which everyone who has spoken agrees, is that we need to take a very careful approach to alternative business structures. I do not think it is necessary to impose specific constraints in the Bill, but I want to explain why. That will enable Members of the Committee to think about what we are doing and how it will work in practice so that they can decide what they wish to do beyond this point in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07012376000085"></a>The first thing to remember is that we will be licensing alternative business structures only when the rules are in place. These rules must be compatible with the regulatory objectives and must meet the  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1059"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1059</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>safeguards in the Bill, but we do not want to rule out allowing them to go ahead if they are ready. If they are ready we can licence them safely&#151;I use that word in the context of the regulatory objectives and safeguards in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07012376000086"></a>I have talked to some Committee Members about whether this could be done slowly or incrementally, but there are real difficulties in how one might physically achieve that without being completely anti-competition, either by going for various sectors or by being unrealistic about constraining geographically the way in which firms, companies and organisations now work, not least because of the internet. It is difficult to see a gradual approach in the sense of trying to limit it geographically, numerically and so forth in that way. However, I agree that we need to do this step by step. The Legal Services Board and the licensing authorities are bound by the regulatory objectives and the firms are bound by the duties in Clauses 88 and 169. The duty is to comply with professional conduct obligations and ensure that non-lawyers do not cause breaches of them.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07012376000087"></a>The Legal Services Board must judge whether the licensing authority rules are appropriate for regulating the risks raised by firms it intends to licence. Those alternative business structures will emerge only when the regulatory framework exists. We do not think that we can control it artificially, while recognising the points behind what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07012376000088"></a>The Bill was designed to improve access to justice. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked about overseas and I mentioned to the Committee before that I have had the privilege of having some meetings with Neelie Kroes who is the Competition Commissioner for the European Union. As I was listening to the Committee, I was reading two of her recent speeches about the importance that competition can play in ensuring access to justice. I will circulate her speech to the jury committee of the European Parliament in November to Members of the Committee because it is interesting in the context of Europe. She is very supportive of many of the ways in which we have sought in this country to develop our services, not just legal services but others as well. She has used us as a model for other countries throughout the European Union. She is an important person in the context of what happens in Europe.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07012376000089"></a>It will be a requirement on those looking for alternative business structures to think about the rules and regulations that apply in other countries&#151; whether or not they are members of the European Union. We have already mentioned the German BRAK and the way in which we want to ensure that we are not being anti-competitive from the UK perspective. We recognise that businesses that are setting up and wishing to work internationally will find ways of developing their structures appropriately and will make their own decisions about whether to go down this route accordingly. We recognise that that approach will need to be thought about and the Competition Commissioner of the European Union will be keen to see us develop it. If there are issues to

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07012376000090"></a>On the specific points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, about access to justice, all of the regulatory objectives must be considered in the licensing of alternative business structure firms, including access to justice. It is possible for conditions to be placed on the alternative business structure firm to ensure that it meets those objectives, providing that that is consistent with those objectives. For example, there may be circumstances where in order to be able to create an alternative business structure a condition might be set that you must continue to do as you do now working in this particular field&#151;legal aid in family cases or whatever. It is possible to do that. Therefore, by putting conditions, one is able to get access to justice. Part and parcel of the way in which the alternative business structures will be put together and allowed is that they must have access to justice as one of the principles under which they will be licensed. It is the regulatory objective full stop.</p>

In previous debates, we have had advice from the Minister that the regulatory objectives under Clause 1 are very much for the board itself to determine. It is perfectly possible for the board to determine that regulatory objective (d) in Clause 1(1),</p>
<ul><a name="07012376000126"></a>&#147;promoting competition in the provision of services&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07012376000097"></a>It is a very good question when the Minister refers to the regulatory objectives, accepting that she has already said that the Government have no intention of putting access to justice as number one&#151;or indeed number two or three&#151;but will leave the priority to the board to decide. There is a concern that access to justice may come lower down the scale compared with one of two of the other objectives. That would undermine the whole question of the alternative business structures. The noble and learned Lord,

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="07012376000098"></a><b><a name="70123-0010.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07012376000159"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> There would not be a devastating effect on access to justice. That is the point. I will use my words rather than the noble Lord&#146;s. I said that when looking at the objectives in the round, the board would determine the weight to be given. I will try to think of an example, although it is always dangerous because I get run over immediately I try to do that. If an alternative business structure planned to offer high-quality accessible legal services in a particular area, but the firm with which it was working already had one lawyer doing a particular piece of work and the new alternative business structure was not sure whether it wished to incorporate it, the board could do two things. It could say, &#147;No, we will direct you to continue doing that work&#148;, or it could say, &#147;Well, two miles down the road someone else of good quality is doing that work, so we won't direct you&#148;, because the access to justice has not been adversely affected overall. If you look at it purely from a hierarchical point of view you could argue that you could never allow that one lawyer to cease that work because, in theory, the access to justice from that firm would have been altered. I deliberately chose a hypothetical situation because I wanted to try to explore it. But the idea that there could be any kind of devastating effect would completely run against everything that we have said about the Bill and that we are seeking to achieve. It is really important that the board is able to look at business structures and regulatory objectives in the round, for exactly the reasons that I have given.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07012376000099"></a>When I send noble Lords Neelie Kroes&#146;s speeches they will see that she consistently makes the point that improving competition and access to justice can have a really positive effect. Those objectives can be interrelated in many circumstances&#151;and that is very important, too.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07012376000100"></a>It is right and proper for noble Lords to be concerned that when alternative business structures are set up something does not get lost. For the noble and learned Lord, the idea that people would lose out in getting justice is horrendous. I agree with him completely; that would be absolutely detrimental. But in the example I have just given, you would have to look at it in the context of what is happening in that area and where else people would be able to get those services. If for 99.9 per cent of the population in a particular area there were better and broader services, of higher quality and with better investment, and it could be demonstrated that for the 0.1 per cent an alternative way had been found&#151;either by direction or in another way&#151;everyone would be perfectly comfortable with that.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07012376000101"></a>Noble Lords are absolutely right to say that in designing the rules, building up to the licensing authorities and enabling people to be licensed, we must ensure that these objectives operate properly and are not overridden completely in a way that noble

I am treating this debate as my chance to explore these issues, as noble Lords would expect, and to ensure that we have got this completely right. I am beginning to think, too, that we must make sure that we see what happens and how the board does what it does, and I shall be giving feedback to my honourable friend Bridget Prentice and my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor in that regard. These are not necessarily issues to put in the Bill, but they are ones to explore properly and make sure that we get right.</p>

<a name="70123-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07012376000102"></a>The principle is to ensure that people do not just cherry pick and that if services start to deteriorate or become nonexistent in particular areas either there can be direction or it will be agreed not to give the alternative business structure approval. We want to ensure that firms are operating in the right and appropriate way to meet all the objectives while recognising that they are to be taken in the round and weighed for their advantages and disadvantages before making a decision. We need to be crystal clear that there could not be circumstances in which there was a devastating effect on access to justice.</p>

I should just say that although people have used Tesco as an example it is my understanding that Tesco has no desire to be involved in this, so we will not pick on it any more&#151;and I apologise to Tesco, through this Committee. Let us say that company X was involved in the provision of lots of different services relevant to the retail sector and wished to invest in and join up with a local legal firm to develop its business, creating an alternative business structure&#151;something new. In so doing, the company would apply to the licensing authority to be allowed to do so, and the authority would look at what was being proposed, the services that were currently offered and about to be offered and the way in which it would affect the locality. I agree with my noble friend Lord Whitty and others that it is of crucial importance in rural communities to ensure that this works effectively and well. The authority would ensure that the principles of the regulatory objectives were adhered to and then would or would not grant the licence with or without conditions on top of it. In so doing, it would be mindful, too, of what else was available in that locality.</p>

The noble and learned Lord said earlier today&#151;and I hope that he will not mind my reminding him&#151;that the personal touch can be an important aspect in the provision of services and that perhaps, if one were able to get legal services from a bigger organisation, that might be lost. That is a fair point. It is important to consider what would happen as a consequence of an alternative business structure, taking on board the impact on the locality, rural community or high street. But that does not mean that one always protects what is there, in all circumstances&#151;although I know that that is not what the noble and learned Lord meant at all&#151;because it may be appropriate for things to move on and for new structures to provide better, high-quality services across the board. So it is again a case of weighing up and making sure that in the context of regulatory objectives the alternative business structures will be able to fulfil what is required.</p>

I referred to her, as noble Lords would expect, only because I sit on the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs. I have endeavoured to talk to her about some of the things

I was referring to the issue that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised about the implications for business operating in the European Union and whether alternative business structures would provide an opportunity for other countries&#151;and the German BRAK has been raised a number of times&#151;to prevent the good and appropriate way in which British firms are competing in the European Union. One interested party&#151;though only one&#151;would be the Commissioner for Competition, because she is looking right across the European Union and talking about the need for reform to take place. I referred to her speeches because&#151;as the noble Lord will see when I send him copies; and I am sure that it fits entirely with Liberal Democrat policy&#151;she has reminded member states of the importance of being able to think about competition appropriately and the benefits to the consumer in the way that it operates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07012378000013"></a>I wanted to make a small interjection which was not meant to be a huge part of what I was saying. But I did not want the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, to think that I had not thought about or started to discuss the issues which have reasonably been raised about whether, by going down this route, we would somehow prevent British business competing effectively across the European Union.</p>

Perhaps I can again pose the question that I put to the Minister at the outset. Does she accept the incremental approach that lay behind my amendment? Does she accept that the Legal Services Board should be extremely cautious in the initial stages of licensing, to ensure that it moves only after the few early licensed ABSs have produced evidence of their impact? That would allay some of the concerns that I expressed in my subsequent speech. Does she accept that that should be the policy of the Legal Services Board&#151;that it should make haste slowly, should license gradually and issue further licences only after it has introduced a monitoring process whose consequences satisfy the concerns that we have expressed about, for example, access to justice, but not only that?</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07012378000016"></a>However, I need to go away and think about the idea that this can be done gradually. One would end up saying that we will take, for example, the first five or 20 and then stop. Which will be the lucky ones able to develop their businesses and compete in the open market using a different structure from that used by others which might want to compete? I am not sure that it is a realistic proposition. Getting this right is about getting it right from the beginning and deciding how to ensure the right processes are in place and the bodies are set up properly. I need to go away and think about how we will know what is happening.</p>

I accept that finding out what has happened is important&#151;not to slow the process down, but to ensure that it is considered. As I think I said in my opening remarks, I want to take all of this away for consideration. But I do not favour this use of the word &#147;incremental&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="07012378000019"></a><b><a name="70123-0011.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07012378000152"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> The noble Baroness anticipated my next question when she asked, &#147;How do we know what is happening?&#148;. We will know what is happening if the Legal Services Board establishes a sufficiently effective system of monitoring to find out what the impact of ABSs is. Where in the Bill is there an obligation on the Legal Services Board to do that? We look in vain, do we not? Will the noble Baroness give serious consideration between now and Report to whether an appropriate amendment could be made to place an obligation on the Legal Services Board to set up a monitoring system, so that we may see what impact these ABSs are having?</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07012378000020"></a>With great respect to the noble Baroness, I derive little comfort from her suggestion that the Bill had safeguards to ensure that the ABSs would not have the detrimental effect that many people have predicted. She referred, for example, to Clauses 88 and 169; but I can see little in either clause that would help. She talked about the importance of competition; well, competition may or may not be good for access to justice&#151;we simply do not know. That is why we need a monitoring system.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07012378000021"></a>I also very much share the view expressed by both the Liberal Benches and my noble friend Lord Hunt about the regulatory objectives set out in Clause 1. The noble Baroness has fought very hard throughout this Committee to give the Legal Services Board the widest possible scope in interpreting that clause. She cannot, with respect, have her cake and eat it. If the Legal Services Board can effectively ignore Clause 1(1)(b), the access to justice provision, surely

<a name="07012378000022"></a><b><a name="70123-0011.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07012378000153"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord. Let me be clear about what I have committed myself to do&#151;the crumbs of comfort from my cake. First, we are all agreed on the cautious approach, which I take to mean setting in train the opportunities for alternative business structures. I will go away and reflect on whether that cautious approach is suitably captured. Leaving the regulatory objectives aside for a moment, I will also go away and reflect on any further safeguards that may be provided and whether the clarity of what I have said about being able to direct and so on are there in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07012378000023"></a>I turn to the regulatory objectives. For the reasons that I gave in my example, clearly quite badly, as usual&#151;where you have created something that gives 99.9 per cent but not 0.1 per cent&#151;I am not keen on the hierarchical objectives. We have discussed that before. However, we absolutely do not to move towards the idea that one could be ignored completely, particularly where access to justice is concerned.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07012378000024"></a>Finally, I will go away and reflect on the whole question of how we know what has happened. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, quite reasonably says there is no such provision in the Bill; there is not. I have no idea whether my noble and learned friend would wish to include such provision, but the point has been well made. It is clear in any event that, somewhere along the way, the Legal Services Board, in its overview, will need to know what is happening, whether it is in Birmingham or across the UK.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07012378000025"></a>I make those commitments, which the noble Lord knows I will honour, to go away and look at all those issues, and to come back before Report to discuss with noble Lords exactly how we think we can address them. I will either satisfy him or I will not, but we will at least have tackled those issues. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have enabled me to hear some of the issues, not least the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07012378000032"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, elections to the National Assembly for Wales generally take place every fourth year on the first Thursday in May. The next elections fall due on 3 May this year. The Government of Wales Act 1998 empowers my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales to make orders governing the conduct of these elections. An order was made shortly before the 2003 Assembly elections and much of that is re-enacted in the order before us today.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07012378000033"></a>However, last year saw the passage of the Electoral Administration Act which resulted in substantial changes to the rules for parliamentary and local government elections, largely based on recommendations made by the Electoral Commission and aimed at improving access to, and encouraging participation in, elections; enhancing confidence in the security of the electoral system, especially in minimising the risk of postal voting fraud; extending openness and transparency in party funding; and ensuring that elections continue to be conducted in a professional manner.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07012378000034"></a>The purpose of this order is to ensure that similar improvements apply to National Assembly elections. Its coverage is more limited than the Electoral Administration Act, first, because Assembly elections are conducted on the basis of existing local government registers; and, secondly, because political parties&#151;and their funding&#151;are regulated on a UK-wide basis. Neither of these issues is addressed in the order. Also, the order does not&#151;and could not&#151;deal with the issue of convicted prisoners&#146; right to vote. That was the subject of a judgment by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Hirst v The United Kingdom and the Government have recently commenced a consultation on the matter. Any resulting extension of the franchise will apply equally to Assembly elections.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07012378000035"></a>The order adapts the changes that have been made to procedures for other elections so that they also apply to the conduct of Assembly elections. For example, it replicates provisions relating to independent observers, allowing candidates to show their commonly-used names on ballot papers, personal identifiers to improve the security of postal voting, and local custody of election documents. After consultation with the Electoral Commission and a range of other interests, the draft order was laid before Parliament on 19 December. Noble Lords have devoted a great deal of time over the past year to considering policy underlying the changes now being proposed, first, during the passage of the Electoral Administration Bill, and later when asked to approve secondary legislation made under it. So the background has already been rehearsed in some detail.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07012378000036"></a>The order is substantial, both in length and content, and I think it would be helpful for me to focus on a few  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1068"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1068</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the more significant changes which are being made. Part 1 is concerned with commencement and interpretation of the order. It repeals the 2003 order and an amendment order made in 2006. Part 2, along with Schedules 1 to 5, deals with the practicalities of conducting Assembly elections&#151;including the administration of absent voting&#151;together with the Assembly election rules, which are set out in Schedule 5. It reflects the new flexibility for voting by patients, other than offenders, who are detained in mental hospitals. Previously, they could vote only by post or proxy. They will now be allowed to vote in person at a polling station, provided the hospital gives them leave. It also allows them to make late proxy applications&#151;up to 5 pm on poll day &#151;if they are unexpectedly not able to get leave of absence.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07012378000037"></a>As with other elections, Assembly ballot papers will no longer have counterfoils. This will allow returning officers to streamline the printing process. The issue of ballot papers will be recorded on a corresponding number list, which will be sealed up after the poll and can be opened only with a court order. One change which will be particularly welcomed is the redesign of the regional ballot paper. In previous Assembly elections, this showed party names and the names of list candidates in columns, and the elector marked their vote at the top. Feedback from voters showed that they did not find this layout helpful. After consultation with political parties and the Electoral Commission, we have responded by prescribing a new regional ballot paper, which is more like the traditional constituency paper.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07012378000038"></a>Following amendments made to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the order provides for party candidates to use either their party name or one of its registered descriptions on the ballot paper. Concern was voiced in 2003 that the six-word limit prevented some parties using a bilingual description. That has now been fully addressed. In Wales, ballot papers may show both the English and Welsh versions of a party&#146;s name, while registered descriptions can include up to six words of English and six words of Welsh.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07012378000039"></a>Part 3 of the order, together with Schedules 6, 7 and 8, is concerned with the election campaign, including limits on election expenses, which have been uprated in line with the recommendations of the Electoral Commission. Schedule 7 defines election expenses and is entirely consistent with the equivalent definition for parliamentary elections. The Electoral Commission will have power to prepare guidance expanding on these provisions. Part 4 and Schedule 9 make provision for legal proceedings to challenge the result of an election and prescribe appropriate remedies comparable to those applying to parliamentary elections.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07012378000040"></a>Part 5 deals with a range of miscellaneous and administrative matters. Noble Lords may particularly wish to note Article 141 which now gives returning officers discretion to translate documents into languages other than English and Welsh and to use Braille or other means of communication. This will ensure that no one is excluded from the democratic process through not understanding our languages or

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07012378000041"></a>I have already said that this is a substantial order. It has to be to ensure fairness in the conduct of Assembly elections and to cater for a range of eventualities, many of which we hope will never occur. Essentially, though, its purpose is to align procedures with those applying to parliamentary elections. I beg to move.</p>

It is a large and complex order, which contains provisions resulting from the Government of Wales Acts 1998 and 2006, the Electoral Administration Act and related subordinate legislation. I have a number of questions and concerns. It would be helpful if the Minister could comment on them in his winding-up speech.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07012378000044"></a>The order is an A to Z of the electoral process for Welsh Assembly elections. A great deal of commendable work has clearly gone into its preparation. I am glad to note that it has been cleared by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments at somewhat short notice. It will apply to the coming election in May and will, effectively, be the bible for candidates and agents contesting that election and subsequent Assembly elections. It will provide guidance on the whole election process, including voting, campaigning and the conduct of legal challenges, and includes some welcome novel features, to which the Minister has just referred. It is a very important document and it is very important that its provisions should be politically impartial and correct.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07012378000045"></a>I am bound to say that I was taken aback when I saw the 277 pages that comprise the order. It contains some 80 pages of detailed articles, followed by 10 even more detailed schedules. It is by the far the largest statutory instrument that I have ever come across and it could easily be mistaken for a major piece of primary legislation. The Explanatory Notes acknowledge in paragraph 4.4 the complexity of the changes that the SI introduces, and that those concerned with its practical implementation will have their work cut out to meet the challenges it poses. Nevertheless, the parliamentary scrutiny of this complex order is being rushed through both Houses in double-quick time. Unlike primary legislation, an SI cannot be amended and so, whatever fault we may find, it cannot be corrected. I am not sure that the Government have power to correct any defect that we notice.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07012378000046"></a>The intention is for the order to come into force at the beginning of February so that preparations can be made for the elections in May. Why has the order arrived in the House just a week before this deadline? Both the Government of Wales Act and the Electoral Administration Act received Royal Assent in July last year. Why was this order not presented before the House sooner? Does the Minister agree that the order and its implementation are running to a very tight schedule?</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1070"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1070</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70123-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07012378000047"></a>This point is particularly relevant when we consider the details relating to the process for securing a postal vote in Schedule 2. Under this, registration officers will contact existing postal voters to request personal identifiers; namely, date of birth and signature. This information will have to be provided within 42 days. Failure to do so within this time will result in the voter losing his or her entitlement to vote. I received a form and provided identifiers to secure my postal vote for Westminster elections more than a week ago. I have also received a letter from Conwy Council at home in north Wales, but that letter and the council&#146;s action in seeking my identifiers did not result from the passage of this order. The England order came into effect on 1 January, so it looks as if we are running about a month late in Wales. Does the Minister agree that we are short on time?</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07012378000048"></a>I hope that preparations for the delivery of letters requesting personal identifiers are already well under way and that the timetable outlined in Schedule 2 for requiring personal identifiers from existing absent voters can be adhered to. The Explanatory Memorandum which accompanies the order comments:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="07012378000130"></a>&#147;The Government recognises that there may be a risk that some existing postal or proxy voters will not respond and will lose their entitlement to vote by post or proxy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012378000049"></a>I recognise that attempts have been made to minimise this risk by providing for a reminder letter to be sent within 21 days, but does the Minister agree that this is a very serious issue and that postal voters must not be discouraged? Turn-out in elections is already low. Turn-out at the 2003 Assembly election fell to 38 per cent, down from 46 per cent in 1999. That is worryingly low. We must make every effort to encourage people to use their democratic right to vote, but I fear that the process outlined in the order may result in a further fall in turn-out.</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07012378000050"></a>With regard to checking the validity of postal votes, I fully appreciate the need to tackle election fraud, particularly after the scandals that have occurred during local elections in Birmingham, Blackburn and elsewhere. According to an article in last Sunday&#146;s edition of the <I>Sunday Times</I>, there is more fraud of this kind than many of us thought. Introducing tougher checks on postal votes is therefore to be commended, but why have the Government got into a situation where these checks have to be made within such a tight time schedule?</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07012378000051"></a>With regard to checking the validity of returned postal votes, there will be a requirement for returning officers to check not less than 20 per cent of postal votes cast. What is a returning officer required to do if a proportion of the 20 per cent that he checks is not valid? At what stage does a full check kick in?</p>

<a name="70123-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07012378000052"></a>The order implements the controversial provision incorporated in last year's Government of Wales Act that candidates in Assembly elections must stand as constituency or electoral region candidates, but cannot stand as both. It is generally held that this favours and protects the current sitting constituency members, most of whom belong to the party opposite. The order shows clearly that this decision has implications for the electoral expenses regime,

This is set out in Articles 44, 46 and 47, on pages 35 to 37 inclusive, of the order. The amounts are lower for constituency candidates, which suggests that it is cheaper to run as a constituency candidate than as a regional candidate. I do not think that I am alone in finding this expenses regime confusing, not least the suggestion that a constituency candidate at an election to fill a casual vacancy may spend up to &#163;100,000. That is in Article 47.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07012378000053"></a>I return to the late timing of the order. Rushing through such changes often leads to unintended consequences. For example, the requirement for electors to sign for their ballot paper is not now being introduced in England before this year's local elections. This is due to the fact, I am told, that someone discovered that there was no legislation to deal with what would happen if an elector refused to sign: the elector could still demand a ballot paper. Is that true? What is the position so far as this order and Wales are concerned? Paragraph 7.34 of the Explanatory Memorandum contains a reference to electors signing for their ballot paper, but I cannot find a reference to it in the SI. That is a mystery. I hope that the Minister can clear it up, but it is probably too much to expect him to do so off the cuff. If he cannot do it now, I hope that he will write to me.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07012378000054"></a>I reiterate my concern that such an important and complex order needs to be closely scrutinised, and our current procedure, which does not allow amendment, is hardly appropriate. The Government of Wales Act brings into effect the formal separation between the executive and the legislative arms of the Assembly, resulting in most of the statutory functions that are currently exercised by the Assembly becoming the responsibility of the Assembly Ministers. Ministers must therefore take on the detailed implementation of this order. It is vital that they do so fairly and impartially to all electors and candidates, whatever political party they support.</p>

<a name="07012378000055"></a><b><a name="70123-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012378000158"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> My Lords, the order cannot be amended, so we hope that any comments that we make tonight are helpful and can be thought about for future legislation. We have consulted the party in Wales, because this applies more to it than to us with the coming Assembly elections. It wants us to raise two points this evening.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07012378000056"></a>First, there is no provision in the order for a structure for counting a Welsh Assembly election. Under the 1998 Act, there were such provisions. This in effect means that the count can now be a free-for-all. Some constituencies may choose to count as soon as the polls close; some may choose to wait until the following morning. It does not really serve Welsh democracy well to have a chaotic count following what will surely be an extremely well run election. Are there any plans to introduce such provisions?</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07012378000057"></a>The Minister has almost answered the second point already. Samples of the ballot papers for both  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1072"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1072</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the constituency and regional elections are printed at the back of the order. Are these only indicative of ballot papers that may be produced? Form CK for the constituency election refers to a candidate as &#147;Liberal Democrat&#148;, but the party in Wales prefers to be referred to on ballot papers in the bilingual form: Welsh Liberal Democrats/Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol Cymru. We are delighted that there is now enough space on the ballot paper for this. Also, the logo of the bird might sometimes be used by itself and at other times as part of the fuller title. I am sure that the Minister is aware of our concern and ready to put our minds at rest.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07012378000058"></a>Finally, if the Liberal Democrat Benches had won all our amendments when the Government of Wales Bill was introduced here, we would have not an Assembly but a Senedd, or senate. That cannot be amended. We would have had 80 members instead of 60, to thoroughly scrutinise any legislation going before them. To avoid the great dispute between regional and constituency candidates, and who should stand where, we tried to introduce proportional representation in the form of the single transferable vote. That would have been the answer to the problem. There would have been no uncertainty at all between constituency and list members: all members would have equal validity.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07012378000059"></a>We would also have given the Welsh Senedd the same powers as the Scottish Parliament. Noble Lords will remember that we had a long discussion on the subject of water. If the Liberal Democrats had had their way, the Welsh Assembly would have had a voice in the quantity, quality and distribution of water in Wales. It is too late. Her Majesty&#146;s Government decreed otherwise. All we can do is say, &#147;If only you had listened to us on these Benches, we would have had a much more powerful and thorough Act now&#148;.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07012378000060"></a>Elections to the Assembly are to go ahead as outlined in this order. We wish them well, but see them merely as a first step to electing a full and far more democratic Senedd, with far greater responsibilities. The best could well be yet to come.</p>

<a name="07012378000061"></a><b><a name="70123-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012378000159"></a>Lord Crickhowell:</b> My Lords, I express my gratitude to the Minister for introducing this remarkable document. I add to the concerns already voiced by my noble friend from the Front Bench about the process with which we are engaged. It is not a satisfactory way of dealing with parliamentary business to have a 277-page order for debate, unamendable, for consideration in such a short timescale and timetabled in this way.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07012378000062"></a>It has been said that this is an important document; it is also complex. There are a great number of footnotes and explanations in the order itself, as well as the useful document that we have received that tries to make clarity out of obscurity. To see if the whole thing had been drawn up in a proper way, I tried to cross-check by homing in on something with which I thought I was familiar: election expenses. I quickly discovered that the current definitions of election expenses bear little resemblance to those that applied when I was a candidate, admittedly many years ago.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70123-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07012378000063"></a>I inquired of the admirable staff of the Library whether the definitions here were the same as those that had applied in the last two general elections, and if not why not. The Library told me that the definitions are not the same and have been altered because of subsequent legislation. The Minister briefly referred to that point. I emerged satisfied from this exercise that some pretty thorough work has gone into this. I hope that it has gone in so efficiently throughout that there are no errors. Let us face it: it is complex and errors may have occurred. We cannot correct them at this stage and the whole process is advancing at a pretty fast pace.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07012378000064"></a>I have one other observation on electoral expenses: the exclusion of those expenses that have to be put in the candidate&#146;s return, such as accommodation that is the candidate&#146;s sole or main residence, or accommodation provided by others that is a sole or main residence. In practice, is this matter examined with any great closeness by those who administer electoral expenses? Do those who fight for large constituencies and sometimes have to stay away a night from their main residence always return every item of expenditure? That may be so, but it is news to me that this was the law.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07012378000065"></a>Then my noble friend referred to this whole worrying matter of postal votes. I, too, have received a communication from my local authority asking me to give a signature and to identify myself. My wife happens to be abroad, and I will have the greatest possible difficulty in getting a signature back. If, as my noble friend was suggesting, the timetable is even shorter in the case of the Welsh Assembly elections, we really have some practical difficulties to consider. I am not sure how we will resolve them.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07012378000066"></a>My noble friend referred to what he called the controversial part of the 2006 Act, under which candidates may not stand for election at the same time in both an Assembly constituency and an electoral region. My description would be rather more critical than his. I thought that it was a pretty nasty piece of electoral gerrymandering.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07012378000067"></a>The most interesting and revealing part of the documentation that we received was the Explanatory Memorandum, which I found fascinating and very useful; I am grateful for it. In it, we are told that the Electoral Administration Act 2006,</p>
<ul><a name="07012378000133"></a>&#147;aims to make progress on the Government&#146;s four principles found at the core of a healthy democracy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012378000124"></a>The first is &#147;improving access and engagement&#148;. As my noble friend said, with turnout down to 38 per cent, we have a long way to go on the matter of engagement. The second is &#147;improving confidence&#148;. In the light of the scandals to which my noble friend referred and the botched attempt by the Government to rush into much wider postal voting, I think that we are a long way yet from &#147;confidence&#148;. The third is,</p>
<ul><a name="07012378000134"></a>&#147;extending openness and transparency in party financing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012378000125"></a>The Metropolitan Police may have done more than most in developing that process. The final principle is,</p>
<ul><a name="07012378000135"></a>&#147;maintaining professional delivery of election&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012378000126"></a>My noble friend was right to refer to the article in the <I>Sunday Times</I> and the concerns expressed, not just in  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1074"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1074</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that article but by those who are responsible for supervising elections, about the whole question of fraud and postal voting. We have to go quite a long way before we can be entirely satisfied that the system is working in the way that we would all want. I only hope that the fact that we are rushing through this enormous statutory instrument without being able to cross-check it or comment on it in detail will not add to our difficulties and that the Minister is right in hoping&#151;I know that he is genuine in that hope&#151;that the order will improve things rather than make them worse.</p>

<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="07012378000068"></a><b><a name="70123-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07012378000160"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy, Lord Roberts of Llandudno and Lord Crickhowell, for their interesting and substantial comments on the order. I shall attempt to answer all the points but, if I fail to do so, I shall write to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07012378000069"></a>The first point that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, made&#151;a view shared by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell&#151;concerned the timing of the order. Like him, I wish that it could have been brought forward earlier. As he pointed out, the Government of Wales Act and the Electoral Administration Act received Royal Assent several months ago, but this order also takes account of substantial changes made to secondary legislation in recent months. The last of these were in the local government election conduct orders made on 12 December. The present order was laid a week later and I hope that the noble Lord will accept that, in the circumstances, that was the earliest practicable date.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07012378000070"></a>The noble Lord also raised specific points on absent votes and personal identifiers. Because this order could not be brought into force before the end of 2006, the timing provisions for collecting personal identifiers from existing absent voters are different from those in the Absent Voting (Transitional Provisions) (England and Wales) Regulations 2006, which relate to parliamentary and local government elections. But, if an elector has already provided identifiers under the transitional provisions regulations, those will be equally valid for Assembly elections, so there is no need to collect a second set.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07012378000071"></a>We do not want people to fall off the list of postal voters. To minimise that risk, electors who do not respond to the first request will receive a reminder after three weeks. However, personal identifiers are a key element in improving security, so, if an elector has failed to provide them after a total of seven weeks, it will be necessary to remove that person from the list of absent voters. The electoral registration officer must notify electors in writing that that has been done and provide details of how, if they wish, they may submit a fresh application with the required personal identifiers. So every effort is being made to encourage people to remain registered as absent voters.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07012378000072"></a>The level of verification prescribed for personal identifiers is consistent with the approach being adopted at present for local government and parliamentary elections. The Government believe that 20 per cent is a statistically robust figure for sample checking and that it will be a good indicator of  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether fraud is occurring&#151;a concern raised by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, in particular. But this is a minimum: the returning officer may decide on a higher rate and, even if he or she begins with 20 per cent, that can be increased later if evidence of fraud emerges. The Government are keen to move to 100 per cent verification as soon as is practicable and we plan to apply that to Assembly elections at the same time as the change is made for parliamentary and local government elections.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07012378000073"></a>I turn to noble Lords&#146; comments about candidates&#146; expenses. I should emphasise that the order is concerned with the election expenses only of constituency candidates and individual candidates at regional elections. Apart from a small amount for personal expenses, there are no individual limits for party-list candidates, whose election expenses are treated as part of their party&#146;s expenditure, which is regulated under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The limits for constituency candidates are in line with the recommendations of the Electoral Commission. The figures are the same as those that applied at the 2005 general election. Similarly, the &#163;100,000 limit for an election to fill a casual vacancy is the same as that for a by-election to the other place. It reflects the fact that candidates at such elections do not benefit from a wider national campaign. The limit for an individual candidate at a regional election is the aggregate of all the constituency limits in the region, reflecting the need to communicate with a significantly larger electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07012378000074"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, raised three points, the first of which related to the timing of the count and the delaying of it until the next day. The order requires the count to begin as soon as possible after the close of poll. If appropriate, a returning officer can agree with the counting agents to defer the count until 9 am on the Friday morning. But the Government would normally wish the count to be taken forward with a minimum of delay. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales has no plans to exercise his power to issue direction that counting be delayed.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07012378000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, raised the point about signing the ballot papers. In December, my colleagues at the Department for Constitutional Affairs announced that the Government would not be commencing the requirement for electors to supply a signature before receiving their ballot paper in a polling station. Our general approach is that the conduct of Assembly elections should as nearly as possible be identical to that for elections to the other place, so personal voters will not be required to sign for ballot papers at Assembly elections. The decision not to proceed with the requirement for signatures stemmed from uncertainty over the appropriate sanction if a voter refused to sign. The Government plan to clarify primary legislation at the earliest opportunity to bring a clearer requirement for signatures in polling stations. We shall reflect any changes in future Assembly election orders.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07012378000076"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, has a concern about the way in which a party is described  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1076"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1076</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the ballot paper. The ballot papers in the order are only illustrations. Only the names or descriptions that a party has registered with the Electoral Commission can appear on the ballot paper, so, subject to sensible safeguards to avoid confusion or giving offence, that is entirely within the party&#146;s control.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07012378000077"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, asked about the collection of personal identifiers&#151;I believe that I have already answered this point&#151;and referred to his wife, who is overseas. I should emphasise that postal voters will have seven weeks to provide personal identifiers. That is the same for parliamentary and local government elections. The noble Lord mentioned the definitions of electoral expenses. Electoral expenses are set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 as amended by the Electoral Administration Act 2006. We have identified those definitions. He also asked whether the timetable impacts on the four principles that he mentioned. I thank him for recognising the vital importance of those principles, which the Government are committed to meeting in full. The present order replicates provisions already implemented for other elections.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07012378000078"></a>I hope that that response answers all the questions that I have been asked. If I have missed any, I will write to the appropriate noble Lord, but in the mean time I commend the order.</p>

<a name="07012378000091"></a><b><a name="70123-0012.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07012378000168"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> The Minister told us that the alternative business structures, as set out in the Bill, are to achieve the regulatory objectives set out in Clause 1(1)(a) to (g). At Second Reading, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="07012378000131"></a>&#147;I move from regulation to alternative business structures. Part 5 provides a means of increasing competition and choice for the consumer&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012378000127"></a>Looking at the regulatory objectives, we see that that answers paragraphs (c) and (d). He went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="07012378000132"></a>&#147;Companies and firms will now be permitted to have different types of lawyers and non-lawyers working together on an equal footing and will be able to do so with the benefit of external investment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/12/06; col. 1165.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012378000128"></a>Those are the pros of Part 5. It does nothing to support the constitutional principle of the rule of law. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said in a pointed intervention, it does nothing to improve access to justice. It certainly does not encourage an independent, strong, diverse and effective legal profession but the reverse. As for increasing public understanding of citizens&#146; legal rights and duties, it does nothing. Promoting and maintaining adherence to the professional principles? Nothing. From what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said about the regulatory objectives we can see that the balance is against the proposal.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07012378000092"></a>We considered at length how best to improve Part 5 as a whole and concluded that nothing would do so. Unless you accept the principle of alternative business structures as a good thing in itself&#151;we do not&#151;the only thing is to have a stand part debate for every

That is the reason for the lengthy and complicated stand part group on today&#146;s Marshalled List.</p>

<a name="70123-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07012378000093"></a>One must then consider the other side. The Minister said at Second Reading that the Bill provided robust safeguards to protect the consumer&#151;but from what? The answer is a diminution in the service that the legal profession now gives to the consumer. I am glad to see that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is back in his place because he will tell us why, in principle, he supports the Bill. How he can do that as the lone voice of the consumer, as I have previously said, when it is clearly contrary to the consumer interest to have the high street devoid of the legal firms that serve it at the moment, I do not know. How he can do that when the reverse of competition will create monopolies and when competition will not produce the lowering of fees that he, no doubt, looks for, I do not understand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07012378000094"></a>It may be that the de Nederlandsche Bank will wish to co-operate in this country in legal practices&#151;we have the Dutch connection that the Minister was telling us about&#151;but how does that bank or any bank, insurance company, supermarket chain or motoring organisation know where it is best to provide legal services? This is a big issue, and the Minister has told us that she will think about it. What is the situation? When it is considering licensing, will the Legal Services Board look round the country and say, &#147;That&#146;s quite a good place for an alternative business structure. We will invite people to apply for that area&#148;, or will the alternative business structure come forward with an assessment of a place&#151;shall we say in my part of Wales, north-east Wales&#151;and present to the Government its assessment of the need for it to add a legal element or firm to its bank, insurance company or supermarket?</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07012378000095"></a>What will happen? I have been involved in the small high street firm, and I know that high street firms will no longer be able to compete, so they will close down. When they do that, the fees of the large firms that come in will go up. It is classic competition. I remember that, in my early days as a solicitor, the banks used to offer a trustee service. They would then go to local solicitors and ask them to act on their behalf, which they did. The fees charged by the trustee services of the various banks were far in excess of what high street firms charged. As for usability, how many of us are able to talk to a bank manager in the bank? The Minister is indicating that she can, and she is very lucky. She will have to tell me his name&#151;she will tell me the name of her bank in a minute. In most cases, the manager is somewhere in the country on the end of the phone and inquiries go in all directions. We miss and lack personal involvement with a local solicitor. It is sometimes said that such people have limited expertise, but they have direct access through the legal system of this country&#151;not that of Europe, the Netherlands or wherever else&#151;to the leading people in their field for whatever problem crops up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07012378000096"></a>I mentioned at Second Reading that, as an articled clerk, I had instructed Lord Elwyn-Jones leading the noble Lord, Lord Hooson. I recall on another occasion&#151;this was on the high street&#151;instructing the  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, on a commercial case that happened to crop up. Such cases did not crop up very often but, when they did, we had access to the very best of advice. How is this alternative business structure capable of replacing a system like that by adding on to the banks, insurance companies, motoring organisations and commercial retail firms to which the noble Baroness referred an office for legal services? They are bound to cherry pick, and they are bound not to carry out the community services that we used to do for nothing. I do not believe that it is in the consumer interest for that to happen. It may perhaps be in the interests of the lawyer who wants to sell out and get some capital, but it is not in the consumer interest at all. You also have to consider the professional problems&#151;clause after clause of the Bill seeks to address them&#151;of confidentiality, of legal professional privilege and, specifically, of conflict of interest in a firm that has other interests that go well beyond the interests of the particular client.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07012378000097"></a>I said yesterday and I repeat it today: the Bill is fuelled by the Consumer Council, which sees the LSB as an extension of the Consumer Council. It should not be that way. It is dealing with professional organisations with a long history. It may be that the Law Society has fallen down in one aspect, that of dealing with complaints, in the past few years&#151;it did not used to, but it has recently&#151;but that is not a good enough reason, nor is it in the consumer interests, wholly to throw the legal profession of this country into disarray, to put people out of business and to introduce the alternative business structure that Part 5 provides for. A better service? I do not believe it. A cheaper service? I do not see it.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07012378000098"></a>The Committee will gather that I should declare an interest as a lawyer, but&#151;this is the point that I make&#151;I am at the end of my career. I heard some noble Lords say, &#147;No, no&#148;, and I hope that more people will say that. I have no personal interest in this continuing, but I have a deep feeling for the needs of the legal profession and a deep understanding of how it has served the community of this country. There have been areas where it has fallen down but, compared with the way in which the legal profession of this country represents people, both in this community and in the international community, those setbacks are as nothing. So, without making a further Second Reading speech, I oppose Clause 70.</p>

<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="07012378000099"></a><b><a name="70123-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012378000169"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> I suppose I need to respond to the noble Lord. I apologise that I was not in the Chamber at the beginning of his speech, which I hope was slightly more constructive than some of the rest of his remarks. I came in when he said that I am the lone voice of the consumer. I know we are fairly sparse at this stage of the evening, but it would be deeply regrettable if in the course of this Bill I was the only person who felt it necessary to speak primarily on behalf of consumers. I think he corrected himself a little later on and began to talk about the consumer interest.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07012378000100"></a>I accept entirely that the consumer interest is not always served by greater competition. Some competition  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1080"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1080</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can drive out the best and reduce standards. In general, though, where we have loosened up the markets over the past 30 years, the consumer interest has been served by increased competition&#151;not always, but in general. That has had to be accompanied by effective regulation in the consumer interest and in the interest of the stability of supply of the service or goods.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07012378000101"></a>The Bill seems to do both. It cautiously advances a bit of competition. Compared with every other market we have changed over the past 30 years, this is pretty cautious. The extension of allowing legal services to be conducted in a multidisciplinary firm or to be invested in by non-lawyer interests seems to give great scope for providing more, better and more sophisticated and integrated one-stop shop&#151;although I know the noble Lord does not like that term&#151;services.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07012378000102"></a>In my small town there are almost as many lawyers as there are estate agents, and almost as many again as mortgage brokers. For most consumers, it would be jolly handy if those services were all in one firm when they were conducting the biggest financial investment that they will make in their lives.</p>

<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="07012378000103"></a><b><a name="70123-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012378000170"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> Does the noble Lord not agree that if that were to happen, competition in all sorts of fields in his small town would decrease? Is not the essence of the small-town solicitor that he is in competition with other firms? Is it not the essence of the Bar that every barrister, self-employed, on his own, is in competition with every other barrister?</p>

<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="07012378000104"></a><b><a name="70123-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07012378000171"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> It is part of the present structure that that aspect of, for example, buying a house is, theoretically, a national competition. But the noble Lord is almost contradicting his own arguments, because in practice the people of that small town will probably go to one of their local high street solicitors. There is already competition among solicitors and estate agents. Equally, there would be competition among multidisciplinary ABSs. That is the essence of this issue: the service that solicitors provide ought to be available in many different forms and in combination with other services.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07012378000105"></a>As I was hinting in my intervention on an earlier amendment, there may be areas where that degree of competition could not possibly survive. In the remoter rural areas and very small towns, I suspect that would be a problem. For that reason, assessment and monitoring by the regulator of the effects of introducing these alternative business structures would be a valuable addition to the Bill, at least in terms of Government commitment if it is not a legislative matter. That would be an important aspect. For the vast bulk of people, though, it must be better that the range of services that they normally need in any complex legal transaction could be made available in one place. If they do not like it, they can go back to dealing with the estate agent and the solicitor elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07012378000106"></a>I said earlier to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway&#151;sotto voce, so it is probably not in <I>Hansard</I>&#151;that some of my best friends are lawyers. Rather fewer are estate agents. Among the lawyers I  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1081"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column 1081</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>occasionally see, and I had better not name them, there is quite a keenness for developing new and creative ways of providing their service and new partnerships with other professionals in their locality or sphere of specialism. At the moment, the whole structure inhibits such creativity and the growth of alternative services in that respect.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07012378000107"></a>That is why, in principle, for the bulk of consumers there would be an improvement in the services offered. There would almost certainly be an improvement in the price and the value for money of those services. There needs to be some protection for those areas of the country and those particular specialisms that might be adversely affected; they should probably be provided for. In principle, this change must be a good thing, and I therefore strongly oppose any move to exclude these clauses from the Bill.</p>

What prevents many of the manifestations of those structures coming into place is the lack of rules and regulators. Removing this entire part of the Bill does not remove alternative business structures, it simply removes an opportunity to create the structures in the way that we have designed them.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07012378000109"></a>I reiterate that it is important we do not set ourselves up in your Lordships&#146; House as being either the consumer or not the consumer. I do not believe that in any of our constructive discussions my noble friend Lord Whitty has been the only voice of the consumer. Indeed, many noble Lords have been at pains to point out that, although they may or may not come from the legal profession, they are here to represent their views in the context of either having been a consumer, that they are a consumer, or that they serve a consumer. I am a bit saddened that once again the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, refers to my noble friend as the &#147;lone voice of the consumer&#148;, especially considering the party from which the noble Lord comes. I have huge respect for the Liberal Democrat party. I have worked closely with the party over the years and one of the things I believed it felt most passionately about until today, was that it represented the consumer interest, both in the context&#151;</p>

I am representing the consumer when I say the consumer will suffer. That is what I said&#151;it was the whole burden of my speech: the consumer will suffer with these alternative business structures. The consumer will suffer because at the moment legal services are highly competitive among themselves&#151;you can go anywhere and get as many quotes as you like for whatever you want to do. Whatever legal business you are in, it is highly competitive and it remains so. I am saying that from the consumer point of view, the introduction of a structure that licenses alternative businesses is an additional cost. These licences will not be cheap and they will be passed down to the consumer with no benefit to him. That is

The point I was making was entirely linked to the statement that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is the lone voice of the consumer. I do not deny that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, passionately believes that his distrust of this part of the Bill is based on his desire to serve the consumer well. I was merely making the point that it is a pity if we find ourselves in this Committee trying to differentiate our roles in that way&#151;and I think that it is a pity especially if it comes from the Liberal Democrat Benches. That is the point I was making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07012378000114"></a>I do not believe that the provision is a diminution of the legal profession&#151;that is not the intention. This is about enabling the legal profession to go into partnership with bodies with which it may have a connection, and which are then able to support it by investment and working closely with it to provide better services. I agree with the noble Lord that if we fail to achieve that, this process will not have been satisfactory and the structures will not have delivered what is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07012378000115"></a>I referred earlier to the Netherlands and the august figure of Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for Competition. She is a highly respected woman who serves the Commission well and is regarded as one of the best commissioners. It is not as if the Netherlands were going to encroach on our legal professions but the competition commissioner is interested in the work going on here. I hope that the noble Lord has the benefit of meeting her at some point, as I have had, and seeing the quality of the way in which she approaches her work.</p>

I am suggesting that there may be cases&#151;we can already think of circumstances in which that might happen&#151;where people believe that they can provide services in conjunction with those from the non-legal world. The assumption that this must be anti-legal profession or anti-consumer

Were anyone to seek that, we believe that the safeguards in the Bill&#151;with the proviso I gave about looking again at them&#151;will and should deal with that effectively. It is about better services for the professions and for consumers; it is overarchingly in the public interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07012378000117"></a>Those who wished to enter into such arrangements would go to the licensing authorities and set out their reasons. The authorities would look at their circumstances in the context of the regulatory objectives and make a decision. We should not make assumptions about the detriment to the high street; we should not make the assumption that the high street always provides all the services that people want at the quality and price they want. We are looking for better opportunities but within the context of making sure that access to justice is preserved alongside the other objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07012378000118"></a>The noble Lord asked me, and I put my hand up, whether I go to a high street bank and whether I ever meet my bank manager. Yes I do. I have the phone number of my local bank and there is a person I can speak to. It is not because I am special but because that is how they do it. It is possible to have business structures which provide a highly individualised service. I accept that we have to ensure that that is the case. I also accept what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, who is no longer in his place, said in Committee and to me privately. He would worry if we lost the personal touch. I understand that and will think about it further. I do not accept that there will necessarily be cherry-picking, but I accept that we have to guard against it. That is partly in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07012378000119"></a>I have had many discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who is no longer in your Lordships' House, and I know that he has been talking to a number of noble Lords. I wish he were here to talk about the Bill.</p>

I declare my interest: I spent 15 years of my life developing programmes for pro bono work across a whole range of professions, including the legal professions, to support many community projects. I was a director of Business in the Community, an organisation familiar to many. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, was our legal adviser, so I worked closely with him there as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07012378000122"></a>Interestingly, it was in the main the larger, high-quality firms which were able to offer pro bono work. The difficulty for the smaller organisations was having the resources and the economies of scale needed to release people for that expertise. I remember the noble Lord telling me 20 years ago that his firm got more applications from graduates than any other. It was because of the company&#146;s ethos and approach; it gave graduates opportunities beyond the legal professions. I am sure that he was right and that

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07012378000123"></a>From everything that I know about this, I do not accept for a minute that pro bono work would suffer as a consequence. That is simply not the case&#151;quite the opposite. The more opportunities that are available to a company&#151;because it is bigger and more able to cope&#151;the better. I do accept, and have accepted throughout our discussions on Part 5, our need to ensure within the legislation that we have achieved the things that I mentioned to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. We must ensure that safeguards are correctly in the Bill, look again to see that the regulatory objectives are properly covered and take forward the monitoring. We must do those things and look again, without commitment because I do not know what will come forward as a consequence. The Committee should support this measure, not only in the interests of the consumer, important though that is, and not just in the interests of the opportunities for the profession, important though they are, but because I believe fundamentally that this is a new and important step in making sure that our citizens and our professions get the right quality services.

We were looking at how to approach in a cautious way the development of alternative business structures. We could pilot it, but then you run into the problems I indicated in my previous discussions, as my noble friend will remember. If you say that a pilot means that the first 20 firms to apply get it, what will that do for the quality of the applications of the first 20 firms? Surely, those who wish to will rush forward and say, &#147;We want it because the potential is enormous&#148;. How do you then deal with the fact that you have allowed those firms to come forward and not others, bearing in mind that we no longer have a geographical locality for business? Because of the internet and other means you can have a nationwide approach, which could make the difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0701242000004"></a>Or do you take a sectoral approach and say that companies involved in this sector are allowed to become alternative business structures and move in on the market? I have real difficulties with how one could do that. A cautious approach should be taken. We should make sure that we have set up the rules and the licensing authorities properly. One issue that bears looking at, which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland,

You want to make sure that you have identified the structures that give the best possible effect. I have agreed to look at that issue.</p>

The whole question of pilot schemes greatly exercised the Joint Committee and we did not reach a firm conclusion, but it is worth reflecting for a moment whether it might present a way forward. The Minister is right that it is difficult to decide how to structure a pilot scheme. Earlier in our deliberations today the Minister said, &#147;Who will be the lucky ones who will get those opportunities to demonstrate how alternative business structures can proceed?&#148;, but that is probably the wrong way to look at this.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0701242000006"></a>We had a vigorous debate about pilot schemes on home improvement packs and I engaged in quite a lengthy debate with the Minister's ministerial colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. We had quite a problem about geographical area and whether the scheme would be voluntary or compulsory. The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, recently decided that the issue was probably a little more on the backburner now because we have been exploring how it could be introduced and it gets more and more difficult.</p>

<a name="70123-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0701242000007"></a>However, I also advocated pilot schemes for conditional fee agreements. On reflection, if we had had pilot schemes for conditional fee agreements we might have avoided some of the very serious problems that have arisen. The great advantage of pilot schemes is that you can in a location or particular area look at the effect that a whole new system is going to have. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said earlier, you could have a pilot scheme&#151;although I am not suggesting that Wales, in particular, would be a good idea for a pilot scheme on alternative business structures&#151;in central or north Wales or, indeed, some part of England. You could take a region and see what effect alternative business structures would have. Although the Joint Select Committee did not reach a clear view, I hope that the Minister has not ruled it out. We are all determined to try to make this a success but we need to test the water.</p>

I think that she is much more in favour of evolution. My noble friend referred previously to an incremental approach. There must be a better way in which to test this new concept; even if we do not go back to Sir David Clementi&#146;s ideas of starting with LDPs, we should at least test the water first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0701242000010"></a>By doing as noble Lords suggest, we might end up enabling in a particular locality something that could be construed&#151;although I have not tested this yet and merely make the proposition&#151;as a very anti-competitive measure. We would have to select the first 20 companies or a group of companies operating in a certain locality that could create new structures and operate on that basis, offering different kinds of services. But in the next town, or five miles up the road or 200 yards up the road, there would be companies that could not do that. That is my difficulty with the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0701242000011"></a>I have tried to approach the suggestion that the process should be incremental by looking at it in the context of ensuring when it is set up it is right. Although I know that the noble Lord has quite reasonably raised issues about conditional fee agreements&#151;and I have considered them&#151;this is a different issue. It is right and proper to think about lessons learnt from setting up different aspects up of a regulatory framework and we have to ensure that we get it right. But that is how I would go with the opportunity to monitor. Perhaps we can think further about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0701242000013"></a>I want to throw in one aspect that ties in with what the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was saying. We should not be frightened of competition. I do not think that the providers of legal services have ever had need to be frightened of competition. We have seen an extraordinary amount of change in the past 20 years. It is not at all territorial&#151;I can think of lawyers going from respected firms in London to live in Scotland, who continue to give highly specialised employment law advice. I know that schools with which I am associated take advice on employment issues from people who are not lawyers and that accountants and lawyers already work together. My point is that we should not be frightened of competition. Whatever we do to be cautious and protect from bad developments, we must be careful not to over-regulate. What we expect from lawyers, wherever they are and whoever they are associated with in partnership, is that they are properly trained, that they keep up to date and that they maintain the high professional standards that we expect from all parts of the profession. If we achieve that, we will have gone a long way.</p>

It is an opportunity for new forms of business to develop; but that can happen only when we have got the rules right, when we have licensed people appropriately, when we have clarified matters, as I have promised, to ensure that the devastating effect on access to justice described by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, does not arise&#151;that simply could not happen&#151;and when we have looked again at how the Legal Services Board might review what has happened.

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0701242000016"></a>My job is to allay the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and others who worry in principle that somehow this is a bad change. They are concerned about loss of linkage between the individual solicitor and the client and they are concerned about cherry picking. They want to ensure that those concerns are dealt with appropriately. Equally, I wish to address the slightly different concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, in this context and those of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in relation to the previous group of amendments. They say that while they do not oppose the idea, they oppose anything that is not thought through properly and does not incorporate the stages that would make a difference. I am not opposed to that. I have to say to my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours that I am opposed to piloting, because I do not think that it works. I am opposed to incremental stages because that approach does not work. I cannot think of a way in which it could be done without there being all sorts of difficulties. However, I am absolutely certain that we have to get this right. My job is to demonstrate that we have thought the issue through further or to demonstrate that adequate provisions are already in the Bill. If I can do that, I hope that people will be genuinely excited that this could be an opportunity to develop services.</p>

I have met Mr Molloy of the AA, who, as the Minister has just said, is very excited about the prospect of being able to offer legal services through alternative business structures. I have also met Mr Gulliford of the Co-operative movement, who is equally enthused. Citizens Advice would like also to explore these alternative business structures.

It is right that they are enthusiastic; the Law Society equally so. I hope I am right in saying that; I think I am. The Government cannot pick individual organisations and give them what could and would be seen in the world of business as a competitive edge. That is a fundamental difficulty with the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion. Again, I return to the approach that I have tried to propose: to make sure that we have got this right, we must be absolutely clear. Could the licensing authorities look at, and perhaps model, what could potentially happen?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0701242000019"></a>That modelling process might mean that one is able to reconcile. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s desire for piloting, to make sure that we know what the consequences might be. Again, that is something we can think about. This is not going to come in tomorrow. It is an important and potentially exciting business opportunity for the legal professions, with great consumer benefits. We have to make sure that the potential for any detriment is negated by the way in which it is set up. The noble Lord knows that I am open to, and willing to talk about, all sorts of proposals. Nobody has yet found a proposal that I think is better than the one I have put forward. Simply, it would be wholly inappropriate and wrong to pick a few companies and give them, and nobody else, the chance to do this. We would be unable to do it. We would find ourselves in grave difficulties.</p>

In any processes of this kind one has to consider the rules on competition and, I would argue, justice for the business community in being able to compete. If the AA were given, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, suggests, first bite at this, would that necessarily fulfil our objectives of making sure that there were choices, and so on? I know that is not what the noble Lord would want either. It is an important area, but between the work of the Select Committee and noble Lords, we can make progress and find ourselves able to rejoice in Part 5 of the Bill. Even the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, may yet find himself rejoicing.</p>

Therefore, this is what I said at Second Reading:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="0701242000057"></a>&#147;There is undoubtedly a case for a one-stop professional service so that accountants, insurance agents, estate agents or architects may make cost savings in marketing, administration and office expenses. There are certainly benefits for the professionals, but I query whether there are benefits for the consumer of having only one door to go through, but then being directed to various offices inside a single building&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/12/06; col. 1174.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0701242000023"></a>There are benefits and cost savings for the professionals, and I have no doubt that that is why the Law Society has expressed such support for the idea. I know that the Law Society has supported this. It is not doing so with the consumer in mind. It sees it as a way of sharing costs and expenses and possibly of getting more people through the door. However, from the consumer&#146;s point of view, that is not a way that the Government should go. If they really put the consumer first, it is wrong.</p>

I am not speaking for lawyers; I am speaking on behalf of the consumers. I can do it because I have seen the legal profession at every level, from articled clerk all the way through, and I can see the service that is provided. I reject the suspicion that has permeated some of the comments on the Bill that any objection to what the Government are doing is the result of the lawyers getting together in some way and trying to do down the public. That is rubbish. Although I shall withdraw my opposition to the clause for the moment, I look forward to the further fresh thinking that the Minister promised us to see whether anything actually emerges. In the mean time, I hope to work with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on some of his ideas, which at the least will have an ameliorating effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0701242000030"></a>We agree that it is important to protect consumers through regulation of firms with outside investment or those which are controlled by non-lawyers. However, the additional burden of the ABS regime should not apply wholesale to any firm that may in future appoint a non-lawyer manager as head of one of the activities to which I have referred the Committee and who does not supply any external services. In these situations alone, the protection to the consumer afforded by the ABS regime will be entirely superfluous; and the firms will not be faced with the burden of unnecessary bureaucracy. I beg to move.</p>

I understand that a large number of such situations are already in existence. Many firms of solicitors employ an accountant, for example, as their practice manager. He or she has an important position in the firm. I am quite sure that it is not the Government&#146;s wish to make the whole regulatory system more complex or elaborate. If they have not already done so, it is important that they do a good deal of reconnaissance to find out exactly what is happening presently that does not need any change. They must ensure that they are not doing what one might previously have called &#147;piling Pelion on Ossa&#148;. I have never quite understood how you stick one mountain on top of another, but the point is there. We do not add one level of regulatory requirement to another, or force one down a different but inappropriate route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0701242000034"></a>In the alternative business structures discussed by Sir David Clementi in Chapter F of his report, a firm of this type is a legal disciplinary partner practice. Non-lawyers could become partners or directors, but

I know that there is widespread interest among existing firms in adapting their management structures in this way, as the noble and learned Lord referred to. I would not be surprised if this arrangement were one of the first to emerge under the new alternative business structure licensing arrangements. But I am not persuaded to exclude them altogether from Part 5.</p>

<a name="70123-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0701242000035"></a>The safeguards within the Bill take a flexible approach to new opportunities for practices owned and managed by different combinations of lawyers. We have provided that firms with small numbers of non-lawyer managers can qualify as what we have called low-risk bodies, under Clause 106. This provision was created with exactly this type of arrangement in mind.</p>

<a name="70123-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0701242000036"></a>I am not sure that by exempting them I could be confident that we had any form of regulation over the managers in question. In particular, we need to make sure that there is proper protection for legal services, which in an alternative business structure is the function of the head of legal practice. In principle, I entirely agree that non-lawyer managers can make a real contribution. In most cases their influence is a positive one. Yet as managers they are in an undeniably important position to influence the business, as head of resources or head of business development. It is for that reason that Sir David Clementi recommended that they should be properly accountable to the regulator. As a function of Part 5 of the Bill, if a firm is a licensed body all people in positions of control, whether lawyers or not, are subject to this supervision, bound by specific statutory duties and sanctioned for non-compliance. These safeguards should apply to all managers whether they provide services to consumers or not.</p>

<a name="70123-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0701242000037"></a>We cannot necessarily make a realistic distinction between these cases. Being a partner or director in a firm brings with it influence and responsibility. Where legal services are concerned, it is right that anyone in a position of great influence should be effectively regulated. Effective regulation in Part 5 may be applied flexibly in practice. The provisions in the Bill for low-risk bodies strike the right balance, so I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</p>

Yet he did not recommend the alternative business structures that we are now talking about&#151;far from it. Therefore, I do not see that the noble Baroness can really plead Sir David&#146;s recommendations in support of what she is now proposing. Obviously, I wait to hear the reaction of my noble friend, but I wonder whether the Minister appreciates the fact that, within a law firm, the head of human resources is the head of human resources. He or she has all the power and influence of being head of HR, and the same applies to the heads of IT and finance and so on.</p>

It most cases, they would play a very small role and their influence would not really increase, but this artificial barrier would be removed. In these amendments, the City of London Law Society is seeking to ensure that this small change does not immediately result in the full panoply of alternative business structures.</p>

That is why I made the point about low risk. We can take one of two views. The first is that, if we are to make structural changes in the way that the legal profession works, we should do so in a cautious, measured and appropriate way, recognising concerns that companies may swoop in and take over legal firms in the high street, bringing with them all kinds of negative practices in their relationship with the client, and so on&#151;I exaggerate, but not much; that proposition has been put to me. On the other hand, we could say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s okay if the lawyers have a couple of people in. One is head of business development, one is head of finance, and they can do what they like because they are lawyers and, anyway, we are only talking about a couple of people&#148;.</p>

<a name="70123-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0701242000041"></a>We are in a very difficult and, I suggest, dangerous world. A proper regulatory framework might have the flexibility for people to say, &#147;People coming into our legal firms as partners are able to offer real expertise, support the profession appropriately and provide proper and appropriate legal services&#148;. However, to say that they should not be people of influence or that such matters can be left to the firms is to say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s okay in that set of circumstances but it&#146;s not okay in other sets of circumstances&#148;. There needs to be an appropriate response, which we believe we have in Part 5, bearing in mind everything that I have already said. That response says, &#147;If you make changes, you need to make them properly and recognise that we want to ensure that legal services are provided appropriately&#148;.</p>

<a name="70123-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0701242000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, is undoubtedly right that in the vast majority of cases these people are of high quality and they provide extra services. However, occasionally one or two individuals could have enormous influence on the direction of a legal firm that could alter the access to justice provisions and the regulatory framework objectives and so on. So we have said that we require a gentle and light-touch approach but one that, none the less, recognises that there has been a change.</p>

The issue is that if we have that conjunction of different people, the influence that they bring to bear on the provision of legal services cannot be discounted. If it is an individual, or two or three individuals with specific roles within the legal firm, it can be argued that that is a much lower risk and much less of an issue than if it were a major company coming in with huge resources and so on, but I cannot accept the idea that they have no influence. All I was saying was that it is the same proposition; but the degree is very different and I completely accept that.

It has been very helpful. We are also very grateful for the time of the Minister in another place, Bill Rammell, who has spent quite a number of meetings discussing with us certain aspects of this very non-controversial Bill&#151;I do not know what <I>Hansard </I>will make of that; it was meant to be ironic.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000010"></a>Amendment No. 1 is intended to probe the Government about why it is necessary to reduce the number of council members. It is vital, following reorganisation, that the Learning and Skills Council remains open and accountable and gets away from any possible accusation of being totally centralised. That is why we think that a membership of 10 would be too small. Such a small number gives very little opportunity to ensure that the regions, learning providers, employers, unions and, most importantly, learners are all represented. We have suggested 14 to 18 as the possible number of council members, but we are open to persuasion about the actual number.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000011"></a>Our amendment probes the Government about why they feel it necessary to legislate for a reduction not just from the previous number of members on the Learning and Skills Council but from the number of members on its predecessor, the Further Education Funding Council, which had no fewer than 12 and no more than 15 members. Can the noble Lord advise us? I beg to move.</p>

I understand why a chairman would be interested in having fewer members: you get a more effective discussion. But there is more to it than that; the discussion needs to be fully informed. I share the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns about the need for broad participation, in a body with immense responsibilities

All stakeholders should be engaged. For example, in view of the specialised diplomas that will be such a big part of the Government&#146;s thinking for the 14-to-19 age group, local authorities will be key players because they are the 14-to-16 providers and they therefore need to be on the council. I also agree with the noble Baroness that the students&#151;the beneficiaries&#151;and others must be represented.</p>

Their help has been enormously welcome. I look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s response to the questions posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. However, we should perhaps put on record that in general we support the Government&#146;s encouragement of a small and streamlined Learning and Skills Council.</p>

First, I thank both noble Baronesses for their kind opening remarks. As ever, my policy in dealing with Bills is to deluge noble Lords with as much relevant paper as possible in the hope that that will dissuade them from bringing matters to the Committee. But I appear to have failed comprehensively on that.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000015"></a>We all agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. It is vital that the LSC has a strong, efficient and flexible council which secures strong engagement of employers and all other stakeholders engaged in the further education and training sectors. Clause 1 provides the scope for the council to operate with fewer members, if that is considered appropriate, while remaining balanced and diverse. It is part of our move to streamline the whole Learning and Skills Council in line with our commitments in the White Paper.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000016"></a>We believe that it is right to have the scope to operate with fewer members, but, to put that in perspective, the proposal is for the national Learning and Skills Council to have between 10 and 16 members. Currently, its membership is between 12 and 16, so we are not talking about seismic changes. By way of comparison, under the relevant statute, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority&#151;which has huge responsibilities, including a good deal of responsibilities for development of the 14-to-19 age group diplomas that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, mentioned&#151;has between eight and 13 members, so it operates within a smaller parameter than the Learning and Skills Council. The new Ofsted board serving the enlarged Ofsted, which includes responsibility for all children&#146;s services under the Education and Inspections Act, recently enacted by your Lordships, operates with a board of between five and 10 members. That is potentially half the size of the minimum set out under this Bill, so we believe that it accords with best practice. It will not compromise the capacity of

We will remove 148 local councils, so if the Minister is after streamlining, he will already get that. The Ofsted board is different because it does not necessarily need the regional input that the Learning and Skills Council needs. It is particularly important to allow scope for that regional input.

There is an amendment in my name to probe the planned reorganisation of the LSC, so I should like to concentrate here on the relationship between the LSC as a whole and FE colleges. The Minister has assured us that the Government have committed to increasing the status of further education colleges. We believe that that means trusting them with enough independence to develop their own focus and methods.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000024"></a>We hear a lot in your Lordships&#146; House about the need for flexibility in giving Ministers the power to make regulations. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Further education colleges cannot be expected to respond to local demand for certain skills or courses, or develop their own unique ethos or approach, while being micromanaged by the Learning and Skills Council. At Second Reading, the Minister accepted Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s arguments that the

It is certainly overcomplicated, a network of ill defined and competing agencies all with their own agendas. The LSC is the predominant member of this rather large family, and it has the lion&#146;s share of the power and influence over further education colleges. It is therefore extremely regrettable that it is not only an unelected body but unaccountable to students and colleges. I hope&#151;although I am not holding my breath&#151;that the Minister will be able to reassure me that the LSC&#146;s control over colleges will be light-touch and will allow colleges to develop their own ethos and focus.

I always thought that she looked forward to my responses much more eagerly than is clearly the case. The noble Baroness asked a very general question about whether we support the capacity of colleges to develop their own ethos and mission. We strongly support the capacity of colleges to meet local needs. They are incorporated colleges and to that extent they operate independently. There is a necessary degree of regulation and oversight, and they have to operate within their allocated budget. Subject to that and to their demonstrating good value for money and satisfying inspectors of their quality, they have huge scope to develop their own independent ethos.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000027"></a>The regulatory burden on them will be reduced by the fact that the number of Learning and Skills Councils will be substantially reduced, therefore fewer people will be engaged in the task of regulation. I hope that in general terms I can meet the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns. The further education White Paper clearly sets out the scope of colleges to develop their own individual ethos and mission. It is entirely up to them, for example, how far they seek to engage, subject to quality concerns, in developing sub-degree provision, the nature of their relationship with 14-to-19 partnerships, and how they develop their role in respect of adult skills, basic skills, and so on.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000028"></a>As far as I could see, the amendment would remove the Learning and Skills Council entirely, which, I assume, is not what the noble Baroness intended. I thought that she was proposing that everything would then be done personally by the Secretary of State. My right honourable friend is a man of many parts, but to take the decisions about the individual funding of 1,800 school sixth forms, 385 colleges and 1,000 work-based learning providers, all providing education and training to 5.5 million post-16 learners, is probably slightly beyond him, although he has all their interests personally at heart. I give those figures simply to make the point about the scope of the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s activities. It has responsibility, with an &#163;11 billion budget, for a huge diversity and volume of learning and training. Although we would all like

I appreciate the Minister&#146;s point about not getting rid of the whole council, but the Bill is expanding its role both as a regulatory body and as a service provider to colleges, and it strikes me that there is a potential conflict of interest there. I am unsure how that potential conflict can be resolved when one body does both.</p>

I have tabled further amendments on the powers of intervention of the Learning and Skills Council, so I will not say very much in reply to the Minister now other than that there is concern that this body is unelected and that powers are moving from the Secretary of State, who is ultimately answerable to the electorate, into the hands of a body that is not answerable to any electorate. Although this body will be much slimmed down, which we welcome, it has increasing powers and a huge bearing on the lives of many people. We are worried about it, but I shall touch on that later.

</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000034"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment seeks to amend Sections 2 and 3 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. A very clear distinction is drawn in Section 2(1)(a) of that Act between the education and training of those aged between 16 and 19, who are above compulsory school age but who have not reached 19, and those over 19. According to that Act, the LSC must provide those aged 16 to 19 with proper facilities for their education and training, whereas the LSC&#146;s duty to those over 19 is to provide only reasonable facilities.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000035"></a>When the Learning and Skills Act was originally debated in this House in February and March 2000,  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC314"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we had a very lengthy discussion about the distinction between what was proper and what was reasonable. It became clear in that debate that &#147;proper&#148; implied that those aged 16 to 19 had an entitlement to full- or part-time education and training if they wanted it, whereas &#147;reasonable&#148; provision meant that there was no such entitlement, and that it would be provided at the discretion of the Learning and Skills Council and only so far as resources permitted.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000036"></a>Moreover, the Government made it quite clear that the priority was the 16-to-19 age group, and that, given any pressures on its budget, the LSC should give it precedence. Indeed, that is what we have been seeing in the past few years. Although the participation of the 16-to-19 age group has been well below the 85 per cent target that the Government set in 2000, nevertheless it has been increasing and the instruction through the LSC to FE colleges has been unambiguous. Extra funding for the younger age group means less money for adult courses. Indeed, at present, every place for a 17 year-old is bought at the expense of 10 part-time places for adults.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000037"></a>In our original discussion of the Bill, both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who were led then by Lady Blatch, argued that the Government should be more flexible. Following the recommendation of the National Skills Task Force, which had reported just before the Bill was considered in the House&#151;in the same way as the Leitch report has come just before we consider this Bill&#151;and the earlier report on further education by a group chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, for the Government, we argued in particular that the Government should consider raising the entitlement to full- or part-time education to 25. The Government resisted that proposal then and have done so whenever we have made it subsequently. Indeed, I made the same proposal only last summer during our discussions on the Education and Inspections Bill. They argue that it is much better to leave the issue to the discretion of the LSC rather than to expand entitlement.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000038"></a>We choose to raise this issue again because times move on. We now have the report on skills from the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, a new target that 90 per cent of the workforce will be qualified up to at least level 2, compared to the 70 per cent today, and a Government committed to raising the school leaving age to 18, which makes the 16 to 19 entitlement pretty irrelevant. In particular, the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, proposes that all funding for adult skills should be channelled through employers, through the Train to Gain programme, or to employees through a reintroduced individual learning account, which means that the student effectively carries the money rather than colleges being contracted by the LSC to provide particular courses.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000039"></a>We raise this amendment to probe how far government thinking is developing on these issues. We know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury are very concerned to raise skill levels and have in effect already raised entitlement for under 25s to level 3, although&#151;this reflects our discussions in the summer on the Education and Inspections Bill&#151;they preferred to leave that as discretionary

It shows the direction of the Government&#146;s thinking. The Leitch report forcefully points out that, in 2020, 70 per cent of the workforce will have already completed their education. With an ageing population, adult entitlement to further education and training becomes a crucial factor. Can the Minister give us a view on these new developments? Is it really necessary to continue the distinction between &#147;proper&#148; and &#147;reasonable&#148;? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000040"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07012342000180"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> Like the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, we support the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, in viewing the continuing training of adults as important to both the British economy in the future and the personal development of potential students.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000041"></a>I wish to speak to the Question whether Clause 5 shall stand part. I do so in a probing sense to give the Minister a chance to set out the Government&#146;s intentions behind the clause. There is suspicion among relevant organisations that the Government intend to dissolve these two committees, which we understand is not the case.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000042"></a>I also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Minister about adult learning. Listening to the many organisations involved in further education, it is clear that the Government are giving the greatest priority to young people under 25. This is understandable. As we have heard many times, the number of young people not in education, training or employment has risen by 29 per cent since 2001 and there are now 1.3 million people in this situation.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000043"></a>However, the Government must not allow adult education to suffer because of this. The LSC has predicted that over half a million adult places will be lost by next year, despite the increased funding of further education.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000044"></a>Adults need to be given opportunities to retrain and up-skill. Three million unskilled jobs will be lost between now and 2020, and the workers affected will need further education to move into the skilled jobs that will make up 75 per cent of our economy by 2012. Unless the Government are willing to consign a large number of adults in the future to long-term unemployment, they must maintain the availability of adult education in order to allow people to change careers at any point in their life and to remain in employment for longer. I hope that the Minister will explain to me how unskilled adults are expected to retrain if no suitable courses are available at their local college.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000045"></a>I have no doubt that the Government will attempt to interpret my support for meaningful adult education as a spending commitment. In answer to this, I point out the amount of time and money that the further education sector is expected to spend making up for the deficiencies of schools. Almost half our young people fail to get five GCSEs above grade C, and of the remaining 51 per cent many do not achieve those grades in maths or English.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000047"></a>Of course people need to learn how to read and write, and adults who left school without those skills should have the opportunity to learn them later in life. But it is a mistake for the Government to continue to treat the further education sector as no more than a bandage for the school sector. Adult education is critical now and will become even more critical. There is no other way to give people job security for life in a market where fewer and fewer people have only one career. I hope the Minister will reassure me that there will be no further cuts to adult education and that it will be given its rightful priority.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000048"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012342000181"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I know that this matter concerns priorities and money. However, the Minister will be aware that there is widespread worry within the sector about the squeeze on adult education. In many sectors&#151;my own, for example, is the museum sector&#151;we are becoming increasingly dependent on people who have either chosen to retire or who have been retired early to do jobs that initially they did not necessarily have the complete skills to do. They get some retraining; they may take a course in further education; and they make an extremely valuable contribution, as indeed would be the case throughout the third sector. Bearing in mind issues of public expenditure, I believe that we will become increasingly dependent on the third sector. It would be very short-sighted not to ensure that education and training facilities are available to the people in that sector who wish to make a contribution.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000049"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012342000182"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> I wish to underline that last point. The demography of our country is shifting significantly. As a consequence, unless there is significant immigration to the country, members of the community will need to work more years than currently they tend to do. I do not think simply of those who retire at the formal age of 60 or 65, as used to be, but of those who are retiring early in their 50s. The workforce will require the possibility of these people committing to the economy through undertaking new tasks, which will require new skills. This demographic shift means that we should keep flexible the capacity in the further education sector to provide for such needs.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000050"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07012342000183"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and the sentiments expressed by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. I should stress that the number of funded adult places in further education has not declined, and that the real-terms funding for the sector as a whole, within which of course we have to prioritise needs, is up by 50 per cent from 1997. Although some adults are now expected to pay a large proportion of the costs, these courses are very heavily subsidised by the taxpayer. They cover a very wide range of vocational and skills areas, including those

We pay tribute to the work of colleges; this is and will continue to be an essential part of their role.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000051"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, used the rather&#151;if I may say so&#151;disparaging description of further education as a &#147;bandage for the school sector&#148;. A good deal of the work of further education, including in respect of 16 to 19 year-olds, is to build on the work of the school sector. It provides essential sixth-form courses, vocational training courses, and a whole array of courses which build on the success of pupils at schools. Only one part of the work of colleges is remedial, providing basic skills courses for those who have not attained level 2 by the age of 16. A great deal of the work of further education builds on that, including all those specialised diplomas referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. So it is important not to conflate everything and to get out of proportion the contribution further education makes for students who have not succeeded at school.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000052"></a>Perhaps I may pursue the point about those who have not succeeded. As the noble Baroness knows, over the past 10 years we have greatly reduced the proportion of students who have not succeeded, but while she and I would probably agree on much of what needs to take place in schools to see that standards rise&#151;we are pursuing very vigorously those policies and the investment behind them&#151;it is absolutely right that further education should offer second chances to those who have not succeeded, and we should not regard that as somehow peripheral or inessential. For as long as that remains the case&#151;and for a certain proportion of the cohort it will always remain the case&#151;it is only right that it, too, should be funded. Therefore the notion that it could be simply wished away by the performance of the school system is not a realistic assessment of where we are or are likely to be in the near future.</p>
<h5><a name="07012342000161"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000053"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked me whether our policy on the distinct duties in respect of those over and under the age of 19 was subject to change. It is not subject to change. It is important to recognise the differences in the training and education needs of young people aged between 16 and 19, who have not yet gone into employment or who are on approved training routes such as apprenticeships, and those aged 19 and over, who are already in employment and seeking to improve their skills to go further in their chosen jobs or to change jobs. In that respect our policy has not changed from that which she outlined earlier.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000054"></a>We have also established since 2000 with the new learning and skills sector the basis on which we expect adults to pay for their education and training. We believe it essential that training should be available for all adults who require it, but it would be untenable for the public pursue to have to pay for it all. There are some areas where we provide heavy subsidies and others, including basic skills, where it is free, but beyond that it is right that those who can afford to do  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC318"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so should make a contribution. The Government&#146;s job is to ensure that there is an infrastructure in place for learning, but the costs need to be shared between the state, the individual and employers. It is therefore only realistic to establish that the basis on which they are shared differs for those who are adults as against under-19s.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000055"></a>The amendment would extend the remit of the LSC, forcing it to secure the same provision and facilities for all those over compulsory school age. It is likely that that would make it more difficult to secure the basic and broad provision which is specific to the 16-to-19 age group, setting them up for the rest of their lives in employment. We recognise that many adults need a second chance after the age of 19, and that they need to return to education and/or training to improve their employability and life chances, as set out in part in the Leitch report. Government funding for adults will therefore continue to be focused on those with the lowest skills and will prioritise longer courses to improve employability and to provide a platform for further development. The Government therefore should not be responsible for securing the same provision of facilities for education and training for everyone over the age of 16. That would imply that everyone over that age was entitled to the kind of high-resource, broad provision we currently offer to 16 to 19 year-olds, and we simply do not believe that to be a realistic proposition.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000056"></a>Clause 5 was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. We believe it right to remove the statutory requirement for the Learning and Skills Council to establish an adult learning committee and a young people&#146;s learning committee, as it was required to do under the 2000 Act. Clause 5 gives the LSC the flexibility to respond more effectively to the needs of learners, both adults and young people, and those of employers and communities. However, paragraph 1(1)(b) of Schedule 3 to the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which gives the LSC the power to establish such committees &#147;as it thinks fit&#148; will remain part of the Act. I can assure the Committee that the LSC intends under this existing power to set up committees to establish a single group advising it on the needs of young learners, adults and the workforce as a whole.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000057"></a>We are seeking to strengthen the voice of learners, which is crucial in this regard. Clause 7 makes new provision for the LSC, in exercising its functions, to have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State about consultation with learners. In addition, the LSC is already working at a national level with the newly established national learner council. It is an integral part of the LSC&#146;s business to listen and respond to the views of learners at all levels, but we do not believe it is necessary for it to have separate committees for young people and adults to fulfil that function. Clause 5 gives the council the flexibility it needs to exercise its role effectively in the context of the challenges it faces.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000059"></a>The Minister talked of remedial work being only a small part of the work of colleges, but many to whom we have spoken in the sector tell of their frustration in trying to help their students to reach their full potential when more and more are joining them having achieved only level 1. However, I thank the Minister for his explanation about the different committees in Clause 5.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000060"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07012342000185"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I thank the Minister for his response but I find it rather disappointing. I do not think that he answered my questions about how it is proposed that the Learning and Skills Council will adapt itself, given other proposals. For example, with the raising of the school leaving age, the first part of the Act becomes irrelevant, because it talks about those above the compulsory leaving age but below the age of 19. If the compulsory leaving age becomes 18, it will all need to be adapted. If the money is going directly to the individual and the firm, that will considerably change how the Learning and Skills Council will operate in the adult sector.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000061"></a>The Minister did not respond to those questions. I accept what he said, because there was an inevitability to it. I knew that that was the answer that we would get. Here was an opportunity for him to talk a little about the way things are likely to develop, but we have heard nothing on that.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000062"></a>When I spoke to Amendment No. 3, I had forgotten that it had been grouped with the Question whether Clause 5 will stand part. That change was made overnight and, although I had noted it, my papers had not caught up, so I did not speak to the clause-stand-part Question. I add our support to the probing by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of the Government&#146;s decision. Alone among those here, I think, except for the noble Baroness, Lady David, I was present at our debates on the Learning and Skills Bill in 2000. We had considerable debate about the wisdom of having two separate committees. At that point, the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, who was the Minister at the time, repeatedly assured us that the adult committee was there partly to safeguard adult services.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000063"></a>Adult services are not just services relating to learning, skills and employability but also adult leisure learning, which is an important part of the process. At the time of the Act, the pressures of competitiveness had driven adult leisure learning into a very small corner with ever decreasing subsidies, closure of many adult learning centres and increases in fees. For the general well-being of an ageing population, there is a strong case to be made for maintaining an active and vibrant adult learning programme. We know from good, robust research evidence that those adults who keep mentally and physically active not only live longer but live happier and more fulfilled lives. In promoting general well-being among the older people of this country, adult leisure classes are probably the most cost-effective measure for the Government to promote. Yet

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000064"></a>In all respects, therefore&#151;both in training adults in skills for competitiveness and in providing for the greater happiness and well-being of older members of the community&#151;it is a retrograde step to abolish the two statutory committees within the LSC with their responsibilities to look separately at, and safeguard the interests of, young people and adults.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000065"></a>The Minister gave us an answer similar to the one he gave to the first amendment, tabled by my noble friend Lady Walmsley. Yes, it is convenient if the number of members of the committee is reduced to 10 because the current chairman of the Learning and Skills Council is anxious to have a smaller committee so that he can make it more efficient. Once again, he has said that we should not be tied down by statutory responsibilities to having an adult committee and a young persons&#146; committee, and that it is more convenient to be able to choose the committees at our will.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000066"></a>The original intention in the Learning and Skills Act was for the adult committee to safeguard adult services. We feel let down on that commitment, and that the Government are not living up to their promises. The clause is symptomatic of that.</p>

As a sidelight on leisure learning, I happen to have been looking into languages. We have a problem. I learnt that there has been a marked reduction in leisure learning of languages. Those are attended by people not after certification but who want to learn. The funding is not there. That is a pity because such classes are attended by people who want to learn rather than those who have to learn.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012342000147"></a>(1) The Council must establish, in consultation with its relevant partners and representatives of employers, trade unions, further education colleges and schools, committees (to be called area partnership learning and skills councils) in local or sub-regional areas, to perform the Council&#146;s duties in relation to that area.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000074"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would require the LSC to establish local, subregional partnership groups which will work in co-operation and collaboration with local authorities and other local bodies to meet the needs of the local learning and skills market.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000075"></a>Irrespective of whether Clause 2, on the creation of the nine regional LSCs, will stand part, there is a considerable body of evidence emerging to show that what matter most are not the big, somewhat artificial regional groupings that the Government have created but subregional clusterings around cities and city regions and, in the shire counties, around large towns and their travel-to-work areas. For example, 78 per cent of journeys to work take less than 40 minutes; 70 per cent of house moves are within 20 miles. Industrial clusters and skills markets develop around those subregional hubs. Therefore, establishing the strategic labour market planning at a regional level misses the point unless it is firmly linked into local developments and thinking at subregional level.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000076"></a>Clause 4 picks that up in a different fashion and allows the LSC to establish area groupings of different shapes and sizes. The arrangements for the Greater London area are perhaps a precursor to giving other city regions a degree of autonomy in developing their own skills strategies.</p>
<h5><a name="07012342000162"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000077"></a>By no means every part of the country falls into a city region; nor is autonomy likely to be granted in the short term. The proposed new clause would ensure that the LSC and its newly established regional partners worked with the pre-existing local authorities and partnerships that are already linking up to serve the needs of local labour markets. The new Local Government Bill, which has just been introduced into the House of Commons, establishes these new local area partnerships only to ignore them. It is clearly logical that the LSC, both nationally and regionally, should work in conjunction with local authorities and well established partnerships. This would ensure strong, effective, local collaboration and consultation between the LSC, further education institutions, local businesses and local councils to meet the needs of the local labour and skills markets.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000078"></a>The LSC has other duties. Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 requires it to take account of local area agreements and to work in co-operation with local authorities, and new Section 3D(2) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which was inserted into the Act by the Education and Inspections Act 2006, requires the LSC to work in co-operation with LEA

It therefore becomes increasingly clear that the LSC needs to focus on delivering on its duties at local and sub-regional levels. These amendments are aimed at ensuring strong and effective local collaboration and consultation between the LSC, further education colleges and other trainers, local businesses and local authorities. The national and regional councils may involve themselves in the broader, strategic issues, but delivery needs to be focused on the sub-regional level. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000079"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07012342000190"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> In speaking to the second two amendments in the group, I refer back to the reference made by my noble friend Lady Morris to streamlining, which I think is another word for downsizing. A sound case has not been made for reducing the structure of the LSC from 57 councils to 10&#151;the LSC itself and nine regional councils. We know very little about how the LSC will operate. How decentralised beyond regional centres will it be? How many offices will it have? How many of the present 750 non-executives will remain? Much else is unknown.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000080"></a>The amendment, which would keep 47 of the 57 councils, seeks an explanation of intended LSC resources. The prompt came from the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, when she asked at Second Reading:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012342000150"></a>&#147;Why do we have the Bill? The main reason seems to be to provide legislative cover for the reorganisation of the LSC which has already half been put into effect&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/06; col. 1547.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012342000125"></a>It is also significant that the Minister has not replied to questions about the 148 local partnerships.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000081"></a>The answer to the question whether the LSC is halfway through a reorganisation appears to be yes, because, although we know that reorganisation started in August 2005 with theme 7 of <I>Learning and Skills&#151;the Agenda for Change</I>, the Minister said in response to my noble friend Lady Morris:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012342000151"></a>&#147;We believe, based on our regulatory impact assessment, that these proposals&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012342000126"></a>that is, the proposals in the Bill&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07012342000156"></a>&#147;will help us to save &#163;40 million in the administrative costs imposed on the FE sector&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/06; col. 1608.]</ul>
<p><a name="07012342000127"></a>&#147;Imposed&#148; is a curious word to use about a public body responsible for &#163;11 billion of public money dispersed to 2,600 providers. I thought that the LSC was in partnership with the sector.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000082"></a>We can follow the progress of the LSC&#146;s reorganisation. If we take as a starting point the fact that virtually all the LSC&#146;s administrative costs are people costs and directly people-related costs, we can read across with accuracy from numbers of staff to expenditure. In reporting on Agenda for Change, in the 2005-06 accounts published last July, the LSC gave as its objective a reduction in staff by 1,300, from around 4,550 at the peak to 3,250 by the end of 2006. It looks as though this objective will be met by this March year end. Thus, the opening position before the Bill is enacted will be that the LSC will have reduced its staff by one in four, and lowered its costs  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC323"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by about 25 per cent. In order to fund this major reduction, the LSC has made a provision for exceptional costs of &#163;55.7 million. This prudent move makes it difficult to compare one year&#146;s underlying expenditure with another. By no means all the provision has yet been used. It also reduces any savings made for some years. That point needs to be recognised, both for its own sake and because it is likely to recur.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000083"></a>What of the near future and the second half of reorganisation? On 11 January the Minister wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012342000152"></a>&#147;By restructuring both the Executive and non-executive parts&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012342000128"></a>presumably that refers to local councils&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07012342000157"></a>&#147;the LSC will release savings of up to &#163;40 million a year. This planned additional saving means that a further 600 people will depart, requiring a &#163;25-30 million provision for exceptional costs and bringing the LSC numbers down to 2,650&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012342000129"></a>That drastic streamlining&#151;numbers of staff down by 40 per cent&#151;raises three questions. The first is a big question: what exactly is the Government&#146;s policy towards the LSC? In December the Minister provided no great measure of certainty. There was no ringing endorsement and nothing about strength and independence. Instead, there is a sentence which reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012342000153"></a>&#147;The Bill will enable further efficiencies to be secured in future&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/06; col. 1542.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012342000130"></a>Is that a prelude to following the Mayor of London, who appears to believe that while the LSC may administer the money, it should play no part in how it is spent? The regions could be encouraged to follow.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000084"></a>The second question is: does not a reduction of 40 per cent in staff entail a reduction in responsibilities? We might make this inference from what has been said in response to Foster and from our knowledge of the fragile relationships between the LSC and the sector. However, this Bill increases the LSC&#146;s responsibilities. How does the Minister square that circle?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70123-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000085"></a>Finally, if the LSC&#146;s responsibilities are to be equal to or greater than its present duties, it is plain that there has been a major management misjudgment. It was thought that 4,550 people were needed, but now it is only 2,650. What a disruption to the careers and lives of those who have to depart. They joined in good faith to do the jobs offered to them, but now they are not needed. We need to be told what has happened to these people, against whose departure there have been, to date, provisions of &#163;55.7 million.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000086"></a>In summary, I repeat: I do not think that a sound case has been made for the restructuring proposals in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000087"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012342000191"></a>Lord Dearing:</b> At Second Reading I spoke in support of a move to the regions, but I share the concerns expressed about the need for the council to relate to local requirements. The argument for the new powers for FE colleges is their need to respond quickly to local needs. That is the case, but I cannot see a vision for the LSC to relate to here. This needs to be addressed.</p>

It seems that there was some misunderstanding at Second Reading. I mentioned that we understood why my much-lamented late friend Lady Blatch had said that the Bill was a recipe for disaster and excessive bureaucracy. Then, when my noble friend Lord Baker of Dorking said he did not think that regionalisation was the way forward, the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, responded that there was a difference between myself and my noble friend. I said that there was not and thus sowed even more confusion. We agree absolutely that the way the 2000 Bill was constructed led to the confusion and bureaucracy mentioned by Lady Blatch and we share the concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Baker that moving to regions may not be the answer the Government seek. However, we welcome anything that eases the burden on and cuts the costs of the educational sector. I have now probably caused even more confusion.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000089"></a>Members on these Benches are very glad to see that the Government appear to be trying to reduce the crushing weight of regulation, interference and micromanagement that has descended on both the private and the public spheres during their time in office. That is why we welcome any attempt on their part to reduce the amount of money intended for education being wasted on bureaucracy. It is unacceptable that &#163;1.1 billion of the LSC&#146;s annual budget of &#163;10.5 billion fails to be spent on education or training matters, and I hope that this figure will fall considerably after these changes. However, I too am interested in the point made by my noble friend Lord Eccles about the sum of &#163;55 million that has been earmarked to pay for the reorganisation. I should like to hear how that figure has been justified.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000090"></a>We feel that the initial construction of the LSC, with a prescribed number of local councils, was a mistake. I cannot help but think that if at the time the Government had trusted further education more, right from the start, we would have seen a responsive and flexible system of councils grow from the ground up. For instance, in some areas more local councils might have been needed, particularly in a large region with plenty of diversity like my own in the north-west. In other areas such as Cornwall, a more regional council might have been the answer. Instead we have another reorganisation from the top down. At least the Government are being consistent: one new LSC initiative every year.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000091"></a>I seek reassurance that the move from local councils to regional councils working in conjunction with local partnerships will not merely add another layer of bureaucracy while simultaneously moving decision-making powers away from the local level, where it would be most effective. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain which duties will be handled by the regional councils rather than the local partnerships, or preferably&#151;as we would like to see&#151;by the colleges themselves. I would have thought that most decisions would be most effectively taken at the local or national level, especially on engagement with employers. Most businesses operate on a national or local level, not a regional one. How will

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000092"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response and can hope only that this clause will not fall between two stools. Tackling bureaucratic waste and inefficiency is certainly to be welcomed and I hope that this can be achieved without sacrificing the flexibility that we were hoping for with the use of local councils.</p>

I am glad to tell him that the number is 47. His amendment proposes 47 local LSCs, which is the status quo. I make that point because it sounds as though we may be converging rapidly. The number has come down from 57 to 47. I take it that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, now agrees with the move to the nine regional councils. So I see us converging all the time in agreement on the smaller number rather than the larger number. The noble Baroness remarked on the need to see more money going to the front line and less to bureaucracy.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000094"></a>Bureaucracy is not necessarily a bad thing. The noble Viscount is right: a system has to be administered. But I think that he would also accept that we do not want needless administrative layers and structures. We believe that the statutory requirement for 47 is excessive and that we can release additional funds by taking the steps set out in the Bill. I take it that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, broadly agrees with that. If the discussions between the noble Baroness and her noble friend continue, on Report we might have reached one position. I am delighted that the noble Baroness is with us on the big issue of the reduction from 47 to nine.</p>

We do not know the figure for this year, but I guess that it will be back to about &#163;235 million. In the letter from the Secretary of State of the day, the figure for the next year&#151;in October, somewhat before Second Reading&#151;was &#163;219 million and something. My concern was not about costs. Of course, one welcomes being able to administer a non-departmental public body for less money rather than more. My concern was about the resources: if the staff is reduced drastically, you are reducing the only resource that the non-departmental public body has.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000097"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07012342000195"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> There are a lot of figures here. It would be best for me to write to the noble Viscount to set out the run of figures. I am told that between the first two years that he mentioned, the council took on additional responsibilities, which accounts for the increase. The only figure for administration in the Secretary of State&#146;s letter of 18 October is &#163;219,495,000. The letter does not refer to figures for the other years, but I will willingly establish those.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000098"></a>If there is to be a big reduction in administrative costs, the noble Viscount is quite right that the brunt of that will be borne by reductions in staff. It is not our view that a fixed quantity of staff is always needed to fulfil a set of functions. With technological improvements, changes in regulatory burdens&#151;we have sought to reduce regulatory burdens and to enhance self-regulation in the sector&#151;it is possible to provide a service of high quality and to fulfil the statutory responsibilities of the council with fewer staff. The provisions to which the noble Viscount referred are necessary to see that that reduction in staff is carried through in a fair and orderly way.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000099"></a>However, the reductions that we are talking about need to be taken in a longer view too. The current Learning and Skills Council was established only in 2001. Before then there was the Further Education Funding Council for England and, I think I am right in saying, 72 training and enterprise councils, each of which had its own staff. The Learning and Skills Council therefore came in with an accumulated staff, which it has sought to reduce&#151;in the ways that the noble Viscount set out&#151;from a very much higher level, in many respects duplicating bureaucracy between the Further Education Funding Council and the training and enterprise councils. The reductions that we are seeing at the moment are to some extent a continuation of a process of making the Learning and Skills Council more fit for purpose, not simply in the functions and staff it inherited recently but in those it inherited from the 72 training and enterprise councils and the Further Education Funding Council.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000100"></a>Taking that longer view, we believe that the reductions that we are carrying through are reasonable. We do not believe that it was a misjudgment to have more staff previously. To a substantial extent they were inherited from predecessor bodies. We have a duty to the public purse to see that that money is spent effectively and to reduce the staffing which is over and above that necessary to carry out the council&#146;s functions.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000101"></a>I will certainly look at the point that the noble Viscount raised about whether we know the destination of those who have left the council. I suspect that we probably do not have data on where staff who have left have gone to, but if there is information available I shall let him know.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000102"></a>I have a feeling that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, mentioned the need for local flexibility and sub-national structures some time ago. I was desperately trying to remember whether it was mentioned under this group of amendments or the previous group and whether I had already dealt with it. She was concerned that we might be unduly centralising and regionalising, removing the capacity of the Learning and Skills Council to respond properly to local needs. In that regard I should stress the importance of the 150 or so local partnership teams, to which I referred at Second Reading. The noble Viscount said that I did not set out sufficiently fully what they will do, so I shall do so now.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000103"></a>These local partnership teams, of which there will be about one per local authority&#151;we intend most of them to be coterminous with local authority boundaries precisely to enhance the interaction that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was seeking to promote&#151;will have expert staff who understand local needs and can strengthen the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s ability to contribute to wider social and economic objectives, including through stronger engagement with local authorities and children&#146;s trusts. The local partnership director&#151;each partnership will have its own director&#151;will be fully accountable to the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s area director, who in turn will be accountable to the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s regional director. We believe that these local partnership teams will give the Learning and Skills Council flexible capacity to interact with local authorities and with other local partners within a strong and unified national framework.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000104"></a>In other amendments the noble Viscount seeks to elucidate the detail on the proposed regional councils. The detail of the new regional councils will be set out in regulations rather than in the Bill. We have agreed that the first set of regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution following Royal Assent. We have made a draft of these regulations available to the Committee. I made them available with the draft of a number of other regulations concerning the London board and other aspects of organisation. I am happy to deal with other issues when we come to those matters. Taking stock of this as a whole, we believe that it is appropriate to remove the requirement for 47 local learning and skills councils, and that streamlining the bureaucratic functions of the council is a gain to the sector. It involves less unnecessary expenditure on administration. The introduction of the new local partnership teams will ensure sufficient local responsiveness, to which we attach great importance.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000106"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for expanding a little on the local partnership teams. They are extremely important and provide the key area of co-operation at that level. The one thing we are a little unhappy about is that there is no reference in the Bill to that linking together with local partnerships teams. In the Local Government Act 2000, the Children Act 2004 and the Education and Inspections Act, which we passed last year, there is specific reference to co-operation between the LSC and other bodies. These Benches feel that the Bill would be enhanced if it made some mention of the need for the LSC at a regional level to co-operate with its local partners.

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000111"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 8, which is in this group. Amendment No. 7 relates to the membership of regional councils. We want to ensure that all regional councils include representatives of learning providers by including a governor and a principal of a college and a secondary head to represent the interests of future learners, who, as we see in Clause 7, have to be consulted.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000112"></a>In the light of the abolition of the 148 local LSC officers, it is particularly important to ensure that power and responsibility are given&#151;alongside employers and others&#151;to representatives of those who lead the institutions where the learning takes place and to local authorities. Current best practice involves having such people on local LSC councils, so they have already demonstrated that they have an important contribution to make. I hope that the Government will agree that, with the current re-organisation, there is a need to give statutory force to that best practice.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000113"></a>It is also important to keep a strong link with local authorities in the areas covered and to have them properly represented. Therefore, we would like to see at least one elected representative on each council.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000114"></a>Amendment No. 8 removes the right of the Secretary of State or his representative to attend the meetings of regional councils. We see no need for that provision.

<p><a name="07012342000115"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07012342000198"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> We agree with the noble Baroness that it is vital that both the national and the regional learning and skills councils have an efficient and effective membership which secures the strong engagement of all key stakeholders. This requires the membership to be balanced and diverse to reflect the sector which it funds. I can confirm that we would expect all LSC regional councils to be business-led, drawing employers from the priority skills sectors in the region concerned. This will help ensure that the councils have a good understanding of the skills needs of the local communities they serve. Membership should include a further education college principal and one &#147;other&#148; provider, either a work-based learning provider, a voluntary community-sector provider or a school. We would also expect all LSC regional councils to include a representative from the regional development agency, a trade union member and a member of the local authority. One or more members must be able to bring a good understanding of higher education, and there would be two observer members, one from Jobcentre Plus and one from the government office. So most of the groups mentioned by the noble Baroness are covered by the requirements we intend to impose on the regional councils, on a non-statutory but none the less binding basis.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000116"></a>I reassure the Committee that all appointments will be open and fair, in line with the recommendations of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. We want the very best people to be appointed to the regional LSCs, and to ensure that all members serve the interests of the LSC as a whole rather than speaking on behalf of individual organisations. We intend that the recruitment process should bring about that end.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000117"></a>On Amendment No. 8, the provision is not about micromanaging the LSC; rather it is about working with it to deliver our shared goals, to advise on the Government&#146;s priorities and their wider context, and to add value to the deliberations of the proposed regional councils. It allows regulations about regional councils to make provision entitling a representative of the Secretary of State to attend and participate in discussions, but not in decisions. In this respect it mirrors the current arrangements at national level, which are felt to work well. Meetings of the national council are always attended by an observer appointed by the Secretary of State. Noble Lords will also recall that we have proposed that the first set of regulations, including the provisions to be made under new Section 18A(3)(j), should be subject to affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000118"></a>In the light of those assurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that I have met most of the points she raised.</p>

<p><a name="07012342000120"></a>I am also somewhat reassured by what the Minister said in response to Amendment No. 8: that the representative of the Secretary of State would be involved in discussions but not decisions. Having given certain powers and responsibilities to the regional councils, it would be crazy if the Secretary of State then wanted to keep stepping in to ensure they did exactly what he wanted. He would be setting out the criteria and the councils would be obliged to so act to ensure that those criteria are fulfilled. Being responsible people I am sure they will do that.

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07012342000124"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment seeks additional functions to be given to the new regional LSCs. It is a probing amendment, not least because the principal legislation is rather bereft of declaratory objectives for the LSC, except in Section 4 of the 2000 Act, where the council is given duties to &#147;encourage&#148; individuals and employers to participate in education and training.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000004"></a>Perhaps at this point I might refer to the previous amendment. The point made earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, is important. This Bill gives the Learning and Skills Council and, in particular, the regional learning and skills councils, considerable regulatory powers which were not in the original legislation, which is a shift of responsibilities. None of the issues arising refers to the degree to which regional councils are not responsible to any elected body. They are appointed by the Secretary of State to represent different communities in the region, but they are not elected. Whereas, originally, with many of those responsibilities&#151;certainly the regulatory functions administered by the Secretary of State&#151;the Secretary of State is answerable to Parliament, the regional councils are not answerable to any elected body, which raises issues of principle.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000005"></a>To go back to the additional functions for the regional councils in promoting standards and access, given that Clauses 13 and 14 allow the Learning and Skills Council to take over current Secretary of State powers, for example in relation to individual further education colleges, it is about time that the LSC had

<p><a name="07012370000134"></a>I shall leave proposed sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) for a moment because they are slightly different issues.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000006"></a>Proposed sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) come from new Section 13A of the Education Act 1996, inserted by Section 1 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, at Second Reading on the Education and Inspections Bill noted:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000148"></a>&#147;Part 1 lays new fundamental duties on local authorities in respect of education, replacing their existing duty, dating back to 1944, which is simply to provide "sufficient" education in their localities. Clause 1&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000135"></a>now Section 1 of the Act&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07012370000166"></a>&#147;instead requires them to promote the fulfilment of every child's educational potential and to ensure fair access to educational opportunity&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/6/06; col. 756.]</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000136"></a>Why should the LSC not have a duty to fulfil the educational potential of every adult learner?</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000007"></a>It should be noted that the LSC, under Section 2 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, has a duty to secure &#147;sufficient&#148; facilities to meet the reasonable needs of 16 to 19 year-olds for education and training. However, at present, there is no duty to work towards fulfilling the educational potential of every person undertaking a course funded by the LSC. The duty for over 19 year-olds is only to ensure that &#147;reasonable&#148; facilities are available, which we have already discussed. We think that it is reasonable, given the wide-ranging duties imposed on local authorities in relation to children&#146;s education, that a similar duty be imposed on the Learning and Skills Council for the education and training of over 16s.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000008"></a>Proposed sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) of our amendment would add duties to,</p>
<ul><a name="07012370000167"></a>&#147;co-operate with any local authority as defined in section 1(a) of the Local Government Act 2000, any area of which is in the area of the regional learning and skills council&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000137"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="07012370000168"></a>&#147;promote the well-being of all persons resident in the area of the regional learning and skills council&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="07012370000009"></a>On proposed sub-paragraph (v), Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 gives the purpose of co-operation as the improvement of the well-being of children. Why should not the learning and skills councils have a duty to promote the well-being of people in their area? Promoting the well-being of adults can be done through advancing learning. Learning enables adults to contribute more to society, to gain promotion at work and increased income and job security. It can improve people&#146;s self-worth and mental health, and can make them more competent at dealing with the

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000010"></a>The Bill repeals from the statute book the duty on the local learning and skills councils in Section 22(4)(c) to have regard to the community plans of local authorities in their area. The community plan, developed under Section 4 of the Local Government Act 2000, is where the local authority sets out its strategic plan to promote and improve the economic, social and environmental well-being of its area. Why has this provision been deleted from legislation? How will the new arrangements being put in place by the Bill ensure that the Learning and Skills Council and its regional arms take account of these plans?</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000011"></a>As we have already mentioned, the Learning and Skills Council is on the whole bereft of declaratory duties, so it is hard to provide a framework to submit to regional councils directly based on legislation. Its overall purpose is set out in Sections 2 to 4 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. It was designed in 2000 to be a funding and planning body. The Government have higher ambitions for the council now and communicate their strategy in a detailed letter of targets from the Secretary of State to the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000012"></a>The 2006-07 letter is converted into priorities by the Learning and Skills Council. The most recent priorities are: first, to raise the quality and improve choice of learning opportunities for all young people to equip them with the skills for employment, further or higher learning, and wider social and community engagement; secondly, to raise the skills of the nation, giving employers and individuals the skills they need to improve productivity, employability and social cohesion; thirdly, to raise the performance of a world-class system that is responsive, provides choice and is valued and recognised for excellence; and, fourthly, to increase our contribution to economic development locally and regionally through partnership working.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000013"></a>In total, those priorities are probably not so different from those in Amendment No. 9, except that they have not received direct parliamentary scrutiny. Would it not be better if legislation set out the strategic objectives of the Learning and Skills Council rather than it being done in private by letter from the Secretary of State to the council? I beg to move.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000138"></a>That assertion is questionable. Today we have heard about 150 partnership teams but not where they will be located. Under other stakeholders, local authorities are strangely not mentioned. It does not seem possible to tackle local issues without the intimate involvement of local authorities. I hope that, in whatever way is most appropriate, local authority agreements and other aspects of the relationship between the LSC and local authorities will appear in the Bill.</p>

However, proposed sub-paragraph (v) is a step too far. A duty to promote the well-being of all persons creates a rather broad set of responsibilities, which might provoke claims to the right to have one&#146;s well-being promoted by the council.

We think the amendment is, as the Treasury put it, an uncosted, substantial extension of the duties of the Learning and Skills Council. As so often happens in these discussions, by the end of the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, I thought that we were almost in the same place. She quoted approvingly from the targets set in the annual statement of priorities of the Learning and Skills Council and the Secretary of State&#146;s grant letter, which gives rise to that statement of priorities. I took her to be saying that she thought we were in broadly the right place in the priorities set for the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000017"></a>We are talking, really, then about her issue on robust declaratory ambitions. Perhaps I can meet her concerns. She will know as well as me, because she took part in the deliberations on the Learning and Skills Act 2000, that that Act has robust, declaratory ambitions. Section 3 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000150"></a>&#147;The Council must secure the provision of reasonable facilities for ... education ... suitable to the requirements of persons who have attained the age of 19 ... training suitable to the requirements of such persons ... organised leisure-time occupation connected with such education, and ... organised leisure-time occupation connected with such training&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000139"></a>Section 4 becomes even more declaratory. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000151"></a>&#147;The Council must ... encourage individuals to undergo post-16 education and training ... encourage employers to participate in the provision of post-16 education and training ... encourage employers to contribute to the costs of post-16 education and training&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000140"></a>A good part of the declaratory ambition that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said that she wished to see is there in respect of education and training. So there is no lack of declaratory ambition; it is in the Learning and Skills Act 2000, and those provisions remain in force as amended by the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000018"></a>The wide-ranging amendment would go beyond that remit and impose new declaratory ambitions, including the very wide-ranging one referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, to,</p>
<ul><a name="07012370000169"></a>&#147;promote the well-being of all persons resident in the area of the regional learning and skills council&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000141"></a>which we do not believe to be an appropriate statutory duty to place on a learning and skills commissioning and funding body. Furthermore, this  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC334"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>aspect would cut across the existing role of local authorities, which already have a power to promote the well-being of all persons in their area, including social, environmental and economic well-being.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000019"></a>We agree with the objective of quality set out by the noble Baroness. Through this Bill, the LSC will have the powers that it needs to intervene where providers cannot demonstrate that shortcomings are being addressed promptly and effectively. In addition, the Quality Improvement Agency will work with providers, including those performing poorly, to raise their standards and increase their capacity and capability. Its national improvement strategy, which will be published shortly, will offer a wide range of products and services to promote high standards, including the support of improvement advisers for institutions that are subject to intervention by the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000020"></a>We have strong arrangements in place for achieving fair access to learning, which is also in the amendment, particularly through access to learner support funds. For example, education maintenance allowances (EMAs), which are a significant new programme costing &#163;407 million a year, are a big promoter of access to learning. The take-up of EMAs continues to rise, with payments made to more than 450,000 young people so far this academic year. As the noble Baroness knows, EMAs did not even exist until this Government established them. That &#163;407 million is additional expenditure. This is a vital part of ensuring that young people from all socio-economic groups have an equal opportunity to access learning. Through the Learning and Skills Council, we are also continuing to support vulnerable adults on income-related benefits, who will continue to receive fee remission.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000021"></a>A good part of the amendment is already met either in the existing declaratory duties imposed by the Learning and Skills Act 2000 or by the statement of priorities that animate the work of the council. I regret that we do not feel able to extend to the council a duty to promote the well-being of all persons resident in the area of the regional learning and skills councils.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000022"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07012370000181"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I thank the Minister for his response. Sub-paragraph (v) really extends from Section 10 of the Children Act, part of the purpose of which is to promote the well-being of all children in the area. We took directly from that and thought that it might be appropriate. There is a sense in which it is right to think of further education colleges as having an open door and saying to everyone in an area, &#147;Come inside and talk about your educational needs, and we will see if we can help you&#148;. That philosophy adheres in some further education colleges, and it is very exciting when applied. An enormous number of people in the community have educational needs and shy away from talking about them and realising their potential. Where you can fulfil that potential, well-being is immensely increased. However, I accept that the provision would be a blank cheque.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000023"></a>I argue that the terms of the current Learning and Skills Act, which we are amending in this Bill, are not  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC335"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>really declaratory. In the first place, the Minister spoke about how the council must secure the provision of reasonable facilities for education, training and organised leisure time. That is fine, but the Act goes on to define it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000152"></a>&#147;Facilities are reasonable if (taking account of the Council&#146;s resources) the facilities are of such a quantity and quality that the Council can reasonably be expected to secure their provision&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000142"></a>It becomes, if I might say so, tautological and pretty meaningless, and it has no great vision.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000024"></a>The ideas in the first part of the amendment came directly from the Education and Inspections Act. We spent the best part of three or four days talking about the issue when that Bill was going through this House. They embody a bit of our vision of what we want to achieve from education, but they apply to those at the age of compulsory education. It is appropriate that the Learning and Skills Council is the means by which education for those over the compulsory school leaving age is delivered. Would it not be nice to have a little bit of vision written into the Bill? For the moment, we are not going to get any further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000153"></a> Clause 2 , page 2, line 46, leave out &#147;financial year&#148; and insert &#147;funding period&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000027"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17. The purpose of Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 15, 16 and 17 is to allow the regional councils to plan financially over a period greater than one year. No organisation can plan properly over such a short period. Indeed, schools now have their budgets available over a three-year period, so we believe it is essential for the national council to allow the budgets of regional councils to be worked over the same sort of funding period. We have suggested in Amendment No. 17 that the period should be no less than two years, but we believe that three years, as for schools, would be reasonable.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000028"></a>Amendment No. 12 is somewhat different; it requires the proportion of the budget that must be spent on learners with special needs to be determined. It would be far too easy to neglect the needs of special learners when responding to all the local needs and budgetary pressures. The amendment is intended to protect them. That group are more likely to need the services of a further education college, given that their disability or special need may have meant that they have lost time during their compulsory schooling or that they have been slower than children who do not have their disability in achieving the qualifications of which they are capable.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000029"></a>Further education is of particular value to that group of learners, and provision for that learning should be mandatory. It should be quite clear that the amount considered appropriate for that group is laid out and that the regional council must stick to it and spend it appropriately. We are not trying to tell the regional councils how to spend that money&#151;they  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC336"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must do that, depending on their local knowledge&#151;but the amount of money that needs to be spent on that special group of learners ought to be ring-fenced. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000030"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07012370000183"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 and 15 to 17 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, accord with the Government&#146;s desire to give increased flexibility and certainty over the funding which the Learning and Skills Council and other government-funded bodies receive. She rightly makes the point that it is much better to be able to plan over a two- or three-year period than over a single financial year.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000031"></a>We have sought to ensure multi-year planning through the spending review process. As she knows, each successive spending review covers a three-year funding period. The current Comprehensive Spending Review outcome covering the three years from 2008-09 will be announced later this year. That is expected to give the Learning and Skills Council and its partners significant certainty about the funding available over that funding period. I hope that that will meet the objective that the noble Baroness sought.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000032"></a>However, we cannot support the amendments because there is a risk that they could give the LSC a funding period which would extend across the boundaries of two spending reviews. By anticipating a spending review settlement, that would be in breach of the arrangements in place with the Treasury.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000033"></a>The noble Baroness made important remarks on Amendment No. 12 with respect to people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. I echo her remarks about the very high priority that those groups of learners have and the highest quality provision that they deserve. To ensure that those learners are given high priority, the Secretary of State has informed the Learning and Skills Council through his grant letter that he expects it to continue to prioritise its investment in provision for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, while working with the sector to improve the cost-effectiveness of provision.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000034"></a>The Learning and Skills Council has reflected that explicitly in its annual statement of priorities. On page 22, in the section specifically devoted to learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000154"></a>&#147;Public funding for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities is substantial&#151;in 2004/05 nearly &#163;1.5 billion supported 640,000 learners. These learners remain a priority. We will continue this investment and expect each institution to maintain the proportion of learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities in their overall learner numbers. Institutions should discuss any major planned changes in provision for this cohort with their local partnership teams&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000143"></a>That goes a long way to securing the ring-fencing that the noble Baroness sought. The quality of provision must be maintained, and if major planned changes are proposed, they need to be discussed with the local partnership teams. I will also quote from page 19 of the annual statement of priorities, which states that partners must,</p>
<ul><a name="07012370000170"></a>&#147;continue to prioritise provision for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities&#148;.</ul>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000035"></a>Furthermore, by autumn 2007 the Learning and Skills Council will have a detailed needs analysis for provision for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. That will enable the Learning and Skills Council to plan better and to allocate resources on the basis of actual need. Making it a requirement that guidance from the council to regional councils must state proportions of a regional council&#146;s budget to be spent in this area therefore becomes unnecessary. That would also diminish the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s ability to match resources to need, which will not be spread evenly around the regions. The LSC must have the flexibility to allocate resources to meet need, but the priority for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, which the noble Baroness set out, is one that we entirely share.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000036"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07012370000184"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply. On the first group of amendments, he was concerned that what we have suggested would roll over from one spending review to the next, but there must be some form of words acceptable to the Treasury that would give that roll-over funding provision for a three-year budgetary process. I have no doubt that that would be helpful to the regional learning and skills councils in their own planning. It cannot be right that they just fall off a cliff at the end of a spending review period.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000037"></a>On Amendment No. 12, I am somewhat reassured by what the noble Lord said in his reply, but stated priorities are not quite the same as having something in the Bill. We would have expected, if our amendment were agreed to, that the national Learning and Skills Council would take advice from the regional councils on their needs in relation to learners with special needs before deciding on the proportion of the budget that should be spent on them. We are very aware that for some of these learners, learning costs are higher. It is a little more expensive sometimes if special equipment has to be provided. We are aware that transport to a place of learning can be a major barrier to some learners with special needs, particularly physical disabilities. It is very important that an appropriate amount of money is made available for that and that it is given priority. Certainly, we have some reassurance in the Minister&#146;s words, but we will have to consult those who represent learners with special needs before deciding whether to bring this back on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000041"></a>The noble Baroness said: It seems to be a double act between my noble friend Lady Walmsley and me at the moment. I will speak to Amendments Nos. 14, 20 and 21, which seek to reinforce the duty of the regional learning and skills councils to work in co-operation with the relevant local authority partners. Amendment No. 13 seeks to reinstate the idea of learning and skills councils working in line with the broad strategy developed by local authorities. At present, Section 22(4)(c) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 requires that, in developing its plan for the following financial year, the local learning and skills council should have regard, first, to any guidance issued under the previous section, secondly, to the strategy of any RDA and, thirdly, to,</p>
<ul><a name="07012370000171"></a>&#147;any strategy prepared by any relevant local authority under section 4 of the Local Government Act 2000 (strategies for promoting well-being)&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000042"></a>The Bill no longer talks about plans, but about guidance for the regional councils as to how they should set priorities. The amendment suggests that given that local authorities have a duty to prepare plans relating to well-being, it is only reasonable that regional LSCs should have to have regard to those strategies. Clause 3 effectively repeals Sections 19 to 24 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, so the relevant section I quoted from will be repealed. Further, local learning and skills councils will no longer exist as they are to be replaced by regional bodies.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000043"></a>Amendment No. 14 is in a similar vein, but this time in relation to the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill currently before the House of Commons. Under Clause 82 of that Bill local authorities are required to put in place local area agreements, and again it is both reasonable and logical for the regional LSC to be required to have regard to those agreements.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000044"></a>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 relate to Clause 4, which inserts a new section in the Learning and Skills Act 2000 enabling the LSC to work with city region councils which develop their own labour market strategies, as in the case of London, which is covered by new Section 24B being added by Clause 4. Amendment No. 20 asks that any such strategy being developed on an area basis should take account of local area agreements and/or local improvement targets agreed between local authorities within the area concerned. Likewise, Amendment No. 21 relates to consultation being carried out when formulating strategies and asks that consultation should include both responsible local authorities and partner local authorities where responsibilities are shared with partner boroughs or districts.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000045"></a>The current wording of Clause 4 allows the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to appoint new strategic bodies apparently without having to have any regard to existing economic development, skills or further education plans and partnerships. Therefore, in line with current local government legislative proposals, the amendment suggests that the Secretary of State should ensure that these new

If this is not the case, there is a danger that conflicting strategies could emerge, leading to confusion at the local level. These amendments therefore seek to prevent such confusion from arising. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000046"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012370000186"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> Amendment No. 41 in this group is intended to ensure that local authorities remain involved in decisions affecting children and young people who fall under their responsibility. Clause 17 gives the LSC the power to intervene, sack, replace or direct the governing body of a college, sack members of staff and direct the college to collaborate with other organisations. These powers are very widely drawn and will have a great influence on all students in FE colleges. With such powers being given to an unelected body, does not the Minister feel that some consultation with local authorities would be sensible before they are used?</p>

<p><a name="07012370000047"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012370000187"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I support the approach taken by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. She said in the course of her remarks that conflicts may arise. I would like to alter that to say, &#147;conflicts will arise&#148;. Given the way that the clause has been drawn it is absolutely certain to lead to conflict, and there is a fundamental reason for that: there are national issues and there are local issues, but it is very hard to find a regional issue.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000048"></a>If noble Lords look for regional issues, they will find that they become either national or local; they do not remain regional. I would extend that assertion, which I would be perfectly prepared to speak about at length, but I will not do so now, to cover London. It does not make any sense to say that London stops at London. If you opened a really fine new factory in the south-east, plenty of people who need skills would commute from London to work in that factory. England, perhaps to the Government&#146;s regret, is not amenable to regionalisation. It is too coherent a society; and thank God for that. I feel very strongly that the confusion that we are likely to get into with this Bill is that it is putting in a structure the middle bit of which will not work.</p>

The intervention powers, which are extensive, will not be taken lightly. Given the performance of colleges, we expect action to be taken very rarely. The Learning and Skills Council, where it seeks to invoke those powers, will want to take account of the views of many different local stakeholders. It may well be that by engaging stakeholders to work with the governing body of an institution at risk of failure at an early stage, the LSC will avoid the need to implement any of the most serious measures available to it under the provisions of proposed new Section 56A. Moreover, governing bodies generally include members who have been nominated by local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000050"></a>In those rare cases where action is taken under proposed new Section 56A, the LSC will have as its principal concern the interests of the learners, employers and wider community in the area served by the institution. In that context, consultation is important. It is appropriately addressed in the intervention policy required under proposed new Section 56B. The LSC guidance document, <I>Identifying and Managing Underperformance</I>, states that any policy published will be the subject of consultation with the sector. By taking this approach, a much broader requirement to consult local partners will be built into the policy and the emerging operating procedures to which it gives rise.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000051"></a>The second aspect of the amendment is to make it a requirement that any notice that may be issued to an institution should also be copied to the relevant local authority. I undertake that, as members of the LSC&#146;s regional boards, local authorities will automatically receive a copy of any such notification. However, such a routine administrative procedure is again more appropriately covered by the LSC&#146;s policy document than in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000052"></a>Under proposed new Section 56B(3), the LSC must have regard to any guidance given to it by the Secretary of State in relation to the preparation and publication of the intervention policy and the need to keep it under review. I assure the Committee that the Secretary of State will ask the Learning and Skills Council to ensure that, in developing its intervention policy, it will involve all relevant stakeholders, including the relevant local authority.

<p><a name="07012370000053"></a>In respect of Amendment No. 13, which invites us to consider the importance of arrangements for promoting well-being, local authorities already have the power to do anything that is likely to promote the well-being of all persons in their area, which includes social, environmental and economic well-being. Moreover, the LSC plans to work much more closely with its local partners through the 150 new Learning and Skills Council local partnership teams, which I referred to earlier. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, asked about the geographical areas that the teams would cover. We now have available a draft list of those areas, and I will write to him and other Members of the Committee to set those out.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000056"></a>We are concerned about the amendment&#146;s detailed specifications of how co-operation between the 150 new LSC local partnership teams should happen, which  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC341"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we believe would be excessively onerous and complex. With the move to regional councils, the requirement for the LSC national council, when preparing guidance for a regional council, to take account of any strategy prepared by any local authority in that regional council area would in London, for example, call for the consideration of more than 30 strategies. We believe that the better way forward is to utilise the LSC&#146;s establishment of its new local partnership teams. These teams will be able to address issues of this kind in a local and flexible manner, working with local authorities individually and in a way that reflects particular local circumstances.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000057"></a>Amendment No. 14 is unnecessary, as the LSC and local authorities already work closely together in partnership within the current non-statutory local area agreement arrangements. We want the LSC to have the capacity, structure and flexibility needed to work with partners at local, regional and national levels, and we do not want to impose unnecessary additional bureaucracy and complexity on the LSC to secure something that it is already doing and planning to develop further.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000058"></a>On Amendments Nos. 20 and 21, we agree that bodies formulating strategies should have regard to matters raised by bodies and organisations when strategies are being formulated. Again, however, we believe that to specify these matters in the Bill would introduce an unnecessary level of detail. If it were agreed that specific provision should be made in the Bill for any guidance and directions given to strategy bodies to contain provision for such bodies to have regard to local area agreements and local improvement targets, an equally strong argument could be made for the inclusion of several other types of local or national agreement, for instance sector skills councils and sector agreements. It would not improve the Bill to overburden it with such detail, and to specify some matters but not others would be unhelpful, although we intend these matters to be addressed in directions and guidance once the Local Government Bill becomes law. That Bill will cover most of the areas mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000063"></a>The issue really boils down to the point that I made earlier. We recognise the importance of the local partnership teams and the role that they will play. We are pleased that they are there, and we very much hope that they will be active participants in developing local strategies for learning and skills. But the one thing lacking in the Bill is that there is no mention either of local partnership teams or of the need to consult and work in partnership with local authorities. We mentioned that in relation to earlier amendments and it arises again here. Although we agree that the amendments may not be necessary and may be too prescriptive, a broad reference to the need for co-operation between the regional councils and local authorities would enhance the Bill. I am sure that we will come back to these issues at a later stage. For the present, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000161"></a>The Council must have regard to the Sector Skills Council when preparing guidance or publishing a plan relating to the needs of employers regarding education and training of their employees and potential employees.&#148;&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000068"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment which I hope will give us an opportunity to explore the role of employers in the provision of further education. I have spoken already today about the baffling complexity of the further education sector and the difficulty of establishing exactly who is responsible for what. This is certainly true when it comes to finding a clear, constructive role for employers. I would like to emphasise the importance of this role and to establish whether sector skills councils are being used to their full potential in providing it.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000069"></a>The involvement of employers is crucial to the long-term success of further education. We do not live in a command economy and the Government are not equipped to decide how many plumbers should be trained next year. Nor is the LSC staffed by skilled workers who know what a plumbers&#146; course needs to teach. Without significant business input, we risk detaching further education completely from the real world. Instead, we should be searching for ways in which businesses can make a positive and significant contribution to further education. Business involvement at the highest strategy level is necessary for ensuring that course content is accurate, up to date and, above all, relevant. Its involvement at the local college level in the provision of apprenticeships and practical experience adds enormously to the value of a vocational course. The current situation,  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC343"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where 50 per cent of apprentices in a Merseyside career guidance programme have not had any contact with an employer, is one which benefits neither students, who miss out on an essential part of their vocational education, nor business, which must then employ those who are not fully prepared for the job.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000070"></a>The amendment deals only with the sector skills councils, but there are many other ways of involving employers. I have not tabled amendments on them because I believe that it would be entirely wrong for the Government or even the LSC to pronounce on which interactions should be approved and which not. The sector skills councils need to be given clear powers to do what they can to allow this potential to be fulfilled. Employers need to be given a clear voice at the highest level, while colleges need to be given the freedom to explore options at the most local level. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000071"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07012370000196"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I should like to point out that the role to be played by the sector skills councils in both the development of specialised diplomas and subsequently in whatever may emerge from the Leitch report is considerable&#151;no doubt, central. There is a real question to be asked about whether employers are able to meet the expectations that will be placed on them. The noble Baroness may not know that at the moment many colleges find it impossible to secure practical work placements for apprenticeships. More students put themselves forward for apprenticeships these days than there are work placements available. It is extremely difficult to find employers who are prepared to take them on.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000072"></a>Similarly, time and again if we look at the history of 120 years of reports about skills in this country, expectations have been put on employers and I regret to say that time and again employers have not lived up to them. I hope that we shall see a change of mood on the part of employers. The noble Lord, Lord Leitch, suggested that there should be a voluntary agreement on their part that they will seek to ensure that every employee gains a level 2 qualification. We are a long way from that and I hope that they can live up to those expectations.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000073"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07012370000197"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I entirely endorse the remarks of the noble Baroness about the importance of the sector skills councils. Sector skills councils have an increasingly important role to play in capturing and articulating employer demand for investment in skills. They are strategic, employer-led bodies responsible for identifying priorities for investing in the skills of the sector workforce, and, to take up the remark of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, encouraging further engagement by employers within each sector in taking their training responsibilities seriously.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000074"></a>Currently, sector skills agreements provide the framework for sector skills councils to work with employers in their sectors with key delivery agencies such as the learning and skills councils, regional skills partnerships, awarding bodies and the Government to address priority skills issues in their sectors, including the development of specialised diplomas, which we  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC344"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are seeking to introduce nationwide for 14 to 19 year-olds. The agreements are a key mechanism for articulating skills demand and underpin the move to a more demand-led system of education and training, as set out in our skills strategy.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000075"></a>The role of sector skills councils in capturing and articulating employers&#146; views was stressed recently in the report by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch. Engaging with employers in their sector to stimulate increased demand for investment in skills and influencing how public funding is spent is our central ambition for the sector skills councils. We want to emphasise the importance of working closely with sector skills councils, but we do not think it appropriate to place a specific requirement on the LSC to have regard simply to sector bodies. There are other partners that the LSC will want to consult at national, sub-national and local level. In taking forward priorities, the LSC will want to have regard to regional skills partnerships, local authorities, the Connections service and the Higher Education Funding Council for England, among other bodies.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000076"></a>Furthermore, sector skills councils are already involved in a range of actions to improve learning supply in their sector without specific reference to them in the Learning and Skills Act 2000. These actions vary from sector to sector but include: developing sector qualifications strategies; leading the diploma development partnerships; designing the new lines of learning for the specialised diplomas for 14 to 19-year-olds; developing foundation degree sectoral frameworks; involvement in all aspects of the design of national skills academies and the delivery of the training which the academies will provide; and leading adult apprenticeship pilots in four sectors&#151;construction, engineering, health and information technologies.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000077"></a>Giving sector skills councils a greater role over qualification reform and development, including determining which qualifications should attract public funding, will, we believe, give employers a real opportunity and responsibility for ensuring that qualifications for their sector are economically valuable. The department and the LSC&#146;s consultation on demand-led systems sets out the key role of sector skills councils in the development of those qualification plans.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000078"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, will accept that we see sector skills councils as vital to our strategy for skills. We pay tribute to the enormous work by employers to develop the work of the councils. However, as far as possible, we want to avoid including particular organisations or groups of organisations in the Bill, therefore avoiding unnecessary detail. With the assurances that I have given, I hope that the noble Baroness will be satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000079"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07012370000198"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for his reply and agree with him that greater use of sector skills councils could address many of the problems mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. If we free colleges up a bit more, they could be far more innovative. We already have a scheme where graduates go into teaching  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC345"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before they go on to their chosen profession. Perhaps employers could spend some time learning what it is like to teach in colleges. I do not know; I simply think that there might be other ways of engaging the business sector. There is no doubt that businesses make an enormous contribution, not only in financial input or expertise but in enthusiasm and experience. The Minister said that sector skills councils played a vital part, but we still feel that they are underutilised and have much more to offer. For that to happen, perhaps we will have to wait for another further education Bill or a new Government. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I must admit to having been carried away in a flood of words from time to time, and I remain uncertain that a sound case has been made for the disappearance of the 47 councils. It may indeed have been a mistake to make this particular decentralised structure statutory in 2000, only six years ago, but there it is until Parliament changes it. Another decentralised structure is now needed, not only on paper but in fact, and I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s offer to write to me about the 150 local partnership teams. After all, the further away you are from your partner, the more difficult it is to establish a successful partnership, unless of course mutual tolerance amounting to indifference is your objective.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000084"></a>There are two further points to make. The Minister has said that regionalisation is a response to the Foster report, which concluded that the sector was overbureaucratic and overregulated. The more centralised an organisation is and the further away from the action it is, the more bureaucratic matters become. The closer people working in partnership are, the more likely it is that they will be able to handle the necessary procedures with a lighter and more certain touch. Pulling resources back into fewer offices and larger regions will increase bureaucracy not diminish it.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000085"></a>As to overregulation, we know that there is a good deal of frustration in the sector and that the department seems to go along with that dissatisfaction. The strategy is to reduce regulation. We will have to wait and see how and whether the strategy is implemented. The Bill in fact adds to the Secretary of State&#146;s powers, and adds duties to the LSC&#146;s lists. We need a more detailed explanation of how the LSC will operate once the Bill is enacted. It would be a mistake simply to accept the disappearance of the 47 councils.</p>

I do not have a great deal to add to what I said earlier, which I believe sufficiently justified the steps that we have taken. We believe we gave a satisfactory response to the call made by Sir Andrew Foster in his report, which the noble Viscount will have seen, for a simplification of regulation and administration in the sector. That call mirrors other calls from a wide variety of people, including business leaders who called for a reduction in the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s own bureaucracy and a move towards a more streamlined structure. It also follows our White Paper commitment to make the Learning and Skills Council more streamlined and responsive. Again, the White Paper set out the arguments for that at great length.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000089"></a>Although I know that the noble Viscount, unusually, does not welcome the reductions in costs that we have set out, which come from a reduction in bureaucracy and staffing, I believe that they are widely welcomed in the sector. The sector as a whole believes that administrative overheads have been reduced so far and will be reduced further with the additional &#163;40 million that we hope to save through the Bill. It believes that that is a welcome step forward. We believe that that is a significant justification for the measures in the opening clauses, particularly given that the move towards a regional structure for learning and skills councils is taking place alongside the creation of 150 local partnership teams, which will give us the advantages of local responsiveness on the part of the council and more local responsiveness from the 47 local learning and skills councils than has been possible, while having a more streamlined national and regional organisation for the performance of the statutory functions of the council.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000090"></a>These proposals will provide the LSC with much greater flexibility to work with local partners. They will reduce bureaucracy and increase local responsiveness. That is our justification for the measures, but I will be happy to engage with the noble Viscount further when he has had a chance to study the flood of words more fully.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000095"></a>Directions are a power subject to no parliamentary procedure. They therefore need the most careful scrutiny when included in a Bill, as there is no way back in the way that there is with statutory instruments. The only other line of defence against the arbitrary use of powers by the Executive is practice. The textbooks say that, in practice, directions are for administrative matters, for example accounting procedures, and for matters of last resort. These authorities also say that directions are not used for the control of policy or for decisions

These restraints are important because, in the rare event that a direction was issued as a matter of last resort, the body concerned must comply or have a duty to comply. &#147;Must comply&#148; or &#147;a duty to comply&#148; goes to the heart of any non-departmental public body&#146;s independence, and if it is not independent why have it in the first place?</p>

The dialogue could be expected to reach a conclusion satisfactory to the parties. There would be no need for compulsion; guidance would be sufficient.

Although I may have grumbled about that from time to time in a discussion on devolution, one can at least see the logic. There seems to be no such constraint in these provisions.</p>

We believe that it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to give directions and guidance to a body specified in an order made under Clause 4, and for the body to be established by regulations to be made also under Clause 4. The duty to comply with any directions is higher than the duty to have regard to any guidance, the former allowing greater control over the formulation and review of a strategy. We consider that both will be appropriate in the case of a body specified by an order to be made under new Section 24A or the body established for London.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000101"></a>It will be vital that any strategy produced by a body thus specified, or the London Skills and Employment Board in Greater London, is based on wide and full consultation with relevant organisations and interests. That is why new Sections 24A(4)(e) and 24B(4)(e) specifically refer to consultation as one of the issues to be covered in directions and guidance. We expect directions to specify matters with which the

Draft directions and guidance for the London Skills and Employment Board have been made available to the Committee. These set out the key organisations and interests that the board must consult in formulating its strategy. We believe that they are appropriate, although I would always welcome comments from Members of the Committee.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000102"></a>In respect of the reasonableness and scrutiny of directions, the Secretary of State must always act reasonably as a matter of public law when giving directions. He is subject to challenge by way of judicial review if he does not do so. On the basis of that elucidation and those assurances, I hope that the noble Viscount will be satisfied.</p>

One of the draft regulations that I circulated to the Committee is the draft directions and guidance to the London strategy-making body under Clause 4. Paragraph 8 lists the bodies which the board must consult when formulating its strategy. They are: the Learning and Skills Council, the London Development Agency, Jobcentre Plus, the London Skills Commission, the London borough councils and the Corporation of London, the Greater London Authority, FE colleges in Greater London, employer organisations, trade unions, voluntary bodies&#151;some or all of whose activities benefit the whole or part of Greater London&#151;bodies which represent the different racial, ethnic or national groups in Greater London, bodies which represent the interests of different religious groups in Greater London, bodies which represent the interests of persons carrying on business in Greater London and any other organisations or individuals whom the Mayor of London and board consider likely to be affected by the strategy and appropriate to consult.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000107"></a>That seems an entirely reasonable list of consultees. If the noble Baroness has particular concerns about it, she can regard this Committee as a consultation.

<p><a name="07012370000111"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07012370000213"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden</b> moved Amendment No. 23:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000163"></a> Clause 4 , page 4, line 16, leave out &#147;may&#148; and insert &#147;shall&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000112"></a>The noble Baroness said: As we know, Clause 4, line 16, of the Bill makes provision that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012370000164"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for the establishment of a body for the purposes of discharging the functions set out in subsection (2)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000145"></a>The object of my amendment is to change &#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148;. I want to explain exactly why I have tabled it.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000113"></a>The effect of the provisions is that the Secretary of State would provide in regulations for the Mayor to chair and appoint a body which would formulate a strategy for certain functions of the LSC within the Greater London area. Those functions would be specified as the provision of education&#151;other than higher education&#151;and training of the 19-plus population.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000114"></a>I think that everybody agrees that there is a need for change. Indeed, the Bill has been generally welcomed throughout London and by the Mayor himself. London faces significant and unique skills and employment challenges. A high percentage of London residents are qualified to degree level&#151;31 per cent compared to the national average of 26 per cent. However, 25 per cent of the population are not qualified to basic employability level, the equivalent of at least five good GCSEs, and 14 per cent have no qualifications whatever.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000115"></a>Moreover, London has the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 7.5 per cent, and an employment rate 5 per cent below the national average. A number of factors lie behind this high unemployment and low employment rate. Skill levels are only one dimension, but a key one. There is also a very high level of child poverty, which is again dependent on the high unemployment rate. These major challenges need to be addressed at a London-wide level, reflecting the significant differences in skills and employment between the capital and the rest of the UK. As a Londoner with a background in the trade union movement, these issues are of considerable personal concern to me.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000116"></a>The Mayor argued in response to the Government&#146;s review of powers of the GLA that responsibility for skills should be devolved in London to the Mayor. That apparently has been agreed, with the apparent proviso that it is discretionary rather than a continuing, permanent commitment. London business, the boroughs, the London Assembly and  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC350"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other stakeholders also support some devolution of skills powers in London to the Mayor. Three-quarters of responses on skills to the Government&#146;s review favoured the Mayor having a stronger role in skills.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000117"></a>In July 2006 the Government asked the Mayor to establish an employer-led London Skills and Employment Board. This held its first meeting on 6 December 2006, drawing together some of the capital&#146;s leading representatives from business, education and other areas. The new board is the first of its kind in England and represents a step-change in employment and skills policy in London. It will develop a strategy that specifically addresses the needs both of the London economy and of Londoners. This is similar to the proposals by Leitch and represents an important step towards developing a demand-led approach to skills development and training.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000118"></a>The Mayor welcomes the establishment of the new board and is committed to making it a success. But I understand that he is concerned that the clauses in the Bill underpinning it are put in temporary terms; in other words, it is a case of &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;shall&#148;. In order to secure the long-term position of the new arrangements I have put down this amendment, which would remove the discretionary element and impose on the Secretary of State an obligation to establish an advisory body to formulate a strategy for specified functions. In this way the benefits of the proposal put forward in the Bill will be assured.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000119"></a>It is important for the board and its strategy to be given a permanent basis in London, to ensure the highest level of business engagement with the board and to enable the new arrangements to develop long-term strategic plans for the capital without risk of being disbanded by a new Secretary of State at any time. The amendment would help deliver on this commitment while working within the broad terms for the board agreed between the Government and the Mayor.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000120"></a>I commend the amendment to the Committee. I hope that the Government will see the point of it and will agree that it is worth having a situation in which it is clear that these provisions are permanent and cannot be removed at the discretion of a future Secretary of State. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000121"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07012370000214"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> As the noble Baroness indicated, the support for such a change goes wider than the current Mayor. I refer to what one might consider a slight oddity&#151;the argument that the inclusion of the word &#147;shall&#148; would make the regulations permanent when, of course, a future Government could change the primary legislation. However, the measure would be a recognition of the importance of the devolution package in London.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000122"></a>The current Mayor is a controversial figure, but any mayor might be subject to the Government wondering how they could pull back on devolution. For that reason I support what the noble Baroness said. I recognise that the Government are already some way down this road. The Minister has circulated some details on that. The board has already been appointed and has met. The Minister also referred to directions.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC351"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC351</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000123"></a>I do not want to repeat the points that I made at Second Reading&#151;which the noble Baroness made very strongly&#151;about the importance of London&#146;s government being involved in skills and training. The issues link closely with other areas of the Mayor&#146;s responsibility. It makes perfect sense that the Mayor should have such responsibilities. As I say, I and others would be happy to see the arrangements go further than they do here. I understand the difficulty that the Minister will be in. The noble Baroness is a greater veteran than I of the may/shall argument. I cannot recall that one has ever won it, but that does not devalue the argument.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000124"></a>The Minister said in his letter to my noble friend Lady Walmsley that regulations establishing the board,</p>
<ul><a name="07012370000172"></a>&#147;and directions and guidance given to it, under powers provided in the Bill, will put the Board&#146;s work on a firm statutory footing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012370000146"></a>I emphasise those last three words. If the Minister could say more about permanence, that would be extremely helpful.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000125"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07012370000215"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I associate myself with the amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Turner of Camden and with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000126"></a>London is unique. It has special factors in terms of skills. There is no doubt that some of the problems associated with unemployment in London relate to the mismatch of skills with the requirements of business. The issues of the creation of skills and the demand for skills from business have been divided up across the capital. That is one of the failures of the existing system. There is clearly a need to bring together all those obligations under one body, which would involve both London&#146;s government and the business community in London. We cannot say that London is a series of completely separate labour markets because obviously it is not. There will be different focuses in different parts of the capital but essentially there is a substantial movement of the workforce across London. Therefore, this matter clearly should be addressed on a London-wide basis. One of the problems has been the mismatch between skills offered in London, primarily to young people, and the skills required for the available jobs.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000127"></a>I, too, have fallen foul of the may/shall debate on various occasions in your Lordships&#146; House. I anticipate that we shall cover the same ground yet again on this occasion. But my worry is that we have suffered too long from quick fixes when trying to deal with the issues of skills in London. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, talked about a future Government being able to change primary legislation. However, that is a little more complicated than a Secretary of State saying that a Government will no longer exercise the option of having such a London-wide body. For that reason I believe that the change should be made to require the Secretary of State to create this body and provide the necessary support.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000128"></a>There is now real commitment and enthusiasm from business to try to make the new structures and arrangements work. If we could confirm in statute that these arrangements are expected to remain and

<p><a name="07012370000129"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0006.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07012370000216"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> I support this amendment. I shall not repeat the arguments that we have just heard, which I support, but I wish to make three other points. First, London is an immensely complex place. There is a need to deal with that complexity across different sections of the capital other than on a piecemeal basis. Secondly, the importance of the London economy to the rest of the country means that we must do everything that we can to ensure that the education and skills base in London is as strong as possible. On the third point, which I find easier to make than some, London is larger both in population and impact than parts of the devolved administrations in the United Kingdom, or, indeed, some of the countries within the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="07012370000130"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0006.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07012370000217"></a>Lord Dearing:</b> I too support the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said, the effectiveness of London affects the effectiveness of the whole nation because so much is centralised there. Also it has a regional industry of immense importance&#151;the City of London, which has distinctive needs. The question I put to the Minister is: why is there doubt such that he is saying &#147;may&#148; rather than having a decision to put to the Committee?</p>

<p><a name="07012370000131"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0006.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="07012370000218"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My noble friend Lady Turner and other noble Lords spoke eloquently about the importance of the London Skills and Employment Board and the need for its work to be put on a permanent footing. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, the first meeting of the non-statutory London Skills and Employment Board took place on 6 December. I am told that it got off to a very successful start. It represents that wide diversity of important employment and economic generators and public sector institutions in London, which need to be fully engaged in developing a skills agenda for London. It is chaired by the Mayor, Ken Livingstone, and its vice-chair is Harvey McGrath, the chair of the Man Group, one of our largest hedge fund groups. I believe that many of us never thought that we would live to see a partnership forged by Mayor Livingstone and the chairman of the Man Group. It is a symbol of the unity of purpose which is now evident across London in the need to meet skills priorities. The board&#146;s membership is drawn from a wide variety of public and private sector institutions, including FE colleges, trade unions and the chief executive of NHS London. It brings together all those key partners.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012370000132"></a>The Bill will require a future Secretary of State, as a matter of public law, to consider exercising his discretion to use the power set out in new Section 24B. However, as noble Lords will know, this Government do not allow pettifogging legalities to stand in the way of a desirable objective. Therefore, if my noble friend wishes to table her amendment again on Report, we will give it very sympathetic consideration.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000008"></a>Nearly seven years on from the formation of the Greater London Authority, my views about the need for openness, transparency, inclusiveness and the enhancement of engagement with key partners, as the Minister just called them, are, if anything, stronger. It is important that new arrangements and new powers introduced for the Mayor of London should mesh well with the existing governance arrangements. I am speaking to Amendment No. 26, but the two subsequent amendments are also intended to safeguard against an unaccountable operation.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000009"></a>Amendment No. 26 would ensure that the new body must consult the London Assembly. The Minister referred to the draft regulations. He included the assembly in the list of consultees. This amendment goes further, but possibly not further than the draft regulations. I regret that I am not sure about that. It goes as far as the Greater London Authority Bill, which is being considered in another place, and would make the role of the assembly consistent with its role vis- -vis other statutory strategies under the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Not only would the Mayor of London be required to consult the assembly but to pay attention

All five groups on the London Assembly were unanimous in calling for this amendment.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000010"></a>The assembly&#146;s position is very particular. It is different from those of the other consultees who were listed by the Minister because it has the express role of holding the Mayor of London to account. Its role is not simply one of listening to what the Mayor has to say but of requiring feedback and bringing matters up at a later date and not treating them as done and dusted. An amendment such as this would be entirely consistent with the good practice that the assembly seeks.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000011"></a>The other distinction between the London body and bodies in other parts of the country is, of course, that London has its strategic government, layer or sphere. That difference is appropriately recognised in an amendment such as this. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000019"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment relates to the membership of the board and the appointments made by the mayor, and would give him considerable flexibility. He would not be required to appoint any of the members of the assembly, members of London boroughs, or members of the Common Council of the City of London. That picks up the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, has just made. He would, however, have to address his mind to the desirability of this. The membership announced towards the end of last year&#151;I do not criticise any of the individuals&#151;is not as wide-ranging as one would have hoped. I commented on this at Second Reading. Small businesses, even small and medium-sized enterprises, are hardly represented, if at all; nor are local authorities.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000020"></a>The London boroughs are important partners in the delivery of skills provision. The direct involvement that membership of the board would give is entirely sensible, in addition to its consultative status. Assembly members lead local strategic thinking. As I have said, they have a function with regard to all the mayor&#146;s strategies, and elected members&#151;elections are important&#151;represent the diverse views of constituencies, geographical and otherwise. They would enhance the voice of the public on this body.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000021"></a>Again, the assembly wants this amendment. You might say that we would, wouldn&#146;t we, but I hope that we do not consider these matters entirely personally and narrowly. The Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green groups on the assembly all supported the call for political representatives on the board.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000022"></a>I shall add a personal note that may be repeated several times when we debate the Greater London Authority Bill. The public find it counter-intuitive&#151;that is not my phrase, but it is a good one&#151;that assembly members, having been elected at the same time and with the same mandate as the Mayor of London, have such a narrow and difficult role. They think that we are there to control the Mayor of London in a way that we cannot. I do not seek to do so, but I do seek representation on the board. I beg to move.</p>

As she knows, the arrangements for appointing the board are set out in the draft regulations, which say that the Mayor of London shall appoint the other members of the board&#151;that is, besides himself&#151;with the approval of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000024"></a>The Secretary of State has sent a letter to the Mayor of London setting out the groups that we believe it would be appropriate to be represented. Unfortunately, I do not have a copy of that letter to hand, but I undertake to send it to the noble Baroness and circulate it to the Committee so that she can come back to me if she still has concerns. However, although we want there to be consultation on the formulation of the strategy that the board follows, we believe it is

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000025"></a>When the noble Baroness has seen the letter that the Secretary of State has sent, I will be happy to discuss it further with her. There may be a difference of opinion between us on whether there should be a requirement to appoint members of those bodies, but I believe that we are at one on the need for a broad and diverse membership that reflects the range of organisations that need to be fully engaged in the development of a skills and employment strategy for London. As she said, the membership of the non-statutory board, as it is at the moment, meets that requirement.</p>

There may well be a difference of view between us. As I said, although I had no quarrel with individual members of the board, I felt that it was not sufficiently representative. I am aware there was quite some toing and froing with regard to the appointments, but presumably the Secretary of State does not see the desirability of appointing any borough councillors&#151;not to hold a majority but to represent a point of view&#151;or assembly members or members from the City. Given that those are not included in the first tranche of appointments, I assume that that is not in the Secretary of State&#146;s mind, but I am grateful to the Minister for his offer that we have a further word about it when I have seen the letter. I look forward to seeing that. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It would provide for openness and transparency, which I mentioned in our debates on a couple of earlier amendments, by requiring provision for the public conduct of business and public access to agendas and minutes, obviously with exemptions for confidential business. This is a matter of principle, but it is also a practical matter.

<p><a name="07012374000032"></a>In practice, we endorse the view of the noble Baroness that this should mean an open approach to the board&#146;s work. Our expectation is that the board and the mayor would indeed want to allow public access to meetings and relevant papers as set out in the amendment, but there will be times when that is not appropriate. The second paragraph of the amendment recognises that the body should be able.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000132"></a>However, our preferred approach is not to specify this practice in the Bill, rather to make sure that the mayor and others involved with the board are able to exercise their judgments.

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000039"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 29 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 31. The difference between the two amendments is that the first refers to learners aged 16 to 19 and the second refers to learners who are over the age of 19. The amendments seek to clarify what is meant in Clause 6 by the words &#147;diversity&#148; and &#147;choice&#148;. The clause places a duty on the Learning and Skills Council to act with a view to promote diversity in education and training and increase opportunities for individuals to exercise choice. That duty applies both to 16 to 19 year-olds and to adults.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000040"></a>The amendments are designed to clarify exactly what is meant by &#147;choice&#148; and to ensure that the LSC does not focus solely on institutional structures when  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC358"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fulfilling this new duty, but also takes into account the need to ensure that there is sufficient choice of courses, qualifications and types of place in which to learn.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000041"></a>There is widespread agreement about the need to improve the choices available to young people and to ensure that more of them progress to university or to productive employment, but there are differences on how that can be best achieved. Under the terms of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 any school which wants to establish or expand a sixth form has to apply to the local authority for approval. It is important to highlight the decision-making process on sixth-form provision because all post-16 education is funded not by local authorities but by learning and skills councils. Local authorities approve new sixth-form education but have no accompanying responsibility to fund it. So we have a disconnect between decision-making and funding.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000042"></a>Many local authorities want the majority or even all the schools in their area to have sixth forms. Indeed, the Government have made this easier under the terms of the five-year plan where there is a presumption in favour of it. Having a sixth form is often a matter of status and makes a school more attractive to students.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000043"></a>Clause 6 makes the situation even more complicated by adding a new duty for the LSC to provide diversity and choice in the education and training available for students aged between 16 and 19 as well as for adults. Under the Education and Inspections Act 2006 it is for the LEA to determine which 16 to 19 provision should be approved. That makes it difficult for the LSC, which has a duty to provide diversity and choice in the 16 to 19 provision, when it cannot decide what is provided and where. So there are concerns about the new duty being placed on the LSC, particularly when it is not accompanied by any definition of the word &#147;choice&#148;. There is a danger that the LSC may choose to define &#147;choice&#148; solely as being about institutions, but there is an argument that a local area solely made up of further education, tertiary and sixth-form colleges can provide more choice in terms of courses and qualifications at all levels than one made up entirely of school sixth forms. On the other hand, some people take the alternative view.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000044"></a>We are concerned that any new provision&#151;college or school sixth form&#151;should offer different provision to local youngsters from what is already available and play an important role in offering the widest possible choice of qualifications and courses. However, that is not always the case and the opening of new school sixth forms could, in fact, endanger the future of some courses at other post-16 providers, and in some extreme cases a whole institution&#146;s future. Indeed, Stockport College expressed those concerns to me some time ago. So we need to be sure that when a new sixth form is proposed, it will actually choice and provide the necessary high quality education, but of course not at disproportionate cost.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000045"></a>We have put the word &#147;disproportionate&#148; in our amendment because it must be noted that there are considerable variations in funding levels for 16 to  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC359"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>18 year-olds depending on where and what they are studying. The Government accepted in 2005 that there was a 13 per cent gap in funding between a student in a school sixth form and a college offering the same type of course&#151;a matter about which we on these Benches have often complained. The Government have pledged to reduce this gap and are now consulting on proposals for a common 16 to 18 funding system. But the existence of funding variations reinforces the need to consider value for money. So, while we wait for that gap to be closed, including a duty on the LSC to avoid disproportionate expenditure will make it easier for it to balance its new duty to improve choice and diversity for some learners with its duty to all learners to use public funds equitably and reasonably. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000046"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07012374000171"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I can certainly reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that Clause 6 intends the word &#147;choice&#148; to cover a wide range of learning permutations. We expect &#147;choice&#148; to be interpreted in an all-encompassing way and to include, for example, the form of study, the range of courses available and the timing of study as well as, but not restricted to, the type of course and the place or institution in which that learning takes place.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000047"></a>We wholeheartedly agree with the noble Baroness on the suggestion that such choice should not lead to disproportionate expenditure. However, such a caveat should not apply only to the exercise of choice by learners, but needs to apply to every aspect of the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s funding duties. For that reason Section 2(3)(e) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which is not amended by this Bill, clearly states that the council in performing all its duties must,</p>
<ul><a name="07012374000151"></a>&#147;make the best use of the Council&#146;s resources and in particular avoid provision which might give rise to disproportionate expenditure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012374000133"></a>I hope the objectives that the noble Baroness seeks to achieve are met in terms of a wide definition of choice, including choice within institutions and not simply choice between institutions, and the need to avoid disproportionate expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000051"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendments are fairly self-explanatory. They are the amendments suggested by the Disability Rights Commission mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Low, in his excellent speech at Second Reading. In that speech, he  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC360"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rightly called attention to a sector of the public which is all too often passed over and ignored. He cited figures which highlight the problem. At 16, a disabled person is twice as likely to be in no employment, education or training as their nondisabled peers. At 19 years old, 27 per cent are not in any training or employment. In his letter to the noble Lord, Lord Low, the Minister reassured him that the LSC would indeed consult with disability groups and that guidance would encourage participation by disabled people. The DfES disability equality scheme also lays out past action and future plans to include disabled people at all levels. We accept that and that is fine. I am glad the Minister responded so fully to the concerns of the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000052"></a>However, after consultation with the Disability Rights Commission, we feel that there would still be value in including those commitments in the Bill. Initiatives come and go, political priorities change and what one Minister may promote may not be at the top of the list of priorities for another. Many of us have seen the recent advertisements on public transport showing disabled people's difficulties in finding employment. The most moving is the face of a young man with Down&#146;s syndrome with the caption:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012374000145"></a>&#147;You have just looked at him for longer than any employer&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012374000134"></a>That is a poignant reminder of the obstacles disabled people must still overcome before they are given the opportunities many of us take for granted. Disabled people have a huge amount to offer society. Their inclusion not only gives them personal opportunities for development that further education is all about, but also enriches the institutions of which they are a part and enhances the experience of other students.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000053"></a>I hope that the Minister will seriously consider these amendments and include them in the Bill, knowing, as I do, his commitment through his work on disability. Giving disabled people full access to further education should not be an initiative promoted in response to a short-term skills crisis but a long-term policy enforced in primary legislation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000054"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07012374000174"></a>Baroness Darcy de Knayth:</b> Unfortunately, my noble friend Lord Low has had to leave, but I know that he wanted to speak on Clause 6 stand part. Perhaps I may add a brief word in favour of the amendments. They give me an opportunity to ask whether the provision would include transport where necessary. I was rather cheered by the extracts that the Minister read from the LSC&#146;s annual statement of priorities in relation to Amendment No. 12 in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. However splendid and numerous the courses for adult disabled learners may be, they will be of little use if disabled learners cannot get to them.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000055"></a>I look forward to the Minister's reply and I hope that it will be encouraging. As he is aware, because he offered to meet us, the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Walmsley, and I, together with officials from Skill&#151;I do not think that there is any need to declare that I am the president of Skill as I am not giving its views, although I am sure that they will be very useful at the meeting&#151;are shortly to meet the Minister&#146;s officials to discuss the whole issue.</p>

I am not sure that we need the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, but I hope that we will get some reassurances on the point about transport.</p>

I thank the Minister very much for his very full and careful response to me at Second Reading and subsequently in the letter that he was kind enough to send me. The assurances he gave me at Second Reading and in his letter are very helpful, but I want the Minister to make absolutely clear that in contrasting local mainstream provision and national residential provision he is absolutely confident that national residential provision includes specialist provision. That must be clear, because I think that most of the national residential provision is specialist provision. It would just be very helpful to have the Minister&#146;s confirmation on that point.</p>

I can give the noble Lord, Lord Low, the assurance that he was seeking about the national colleges.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000060"></a>I entirely endorse the sentiments behind the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and we share entirely her objectives. However, we believe that the statutory provisions are sufficient at the moment and that they cover the concerns she raised. They are so robust that they are certainly not at the whim of a change of Minister.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000061"></a>Sections 2, 3, 13 and 15 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 make it clear that the Learning and Skills Council has to consider the needs of disabled people when carrying out its main functions. The LSC must have regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity between disabled and non-disabled people. When considering how best to secure the provision of further education and training, it must take account of the different abilities and aptitudes of different people, which includes disabled people.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000062"></a>Furthermore, in the recently published national strategy for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities, the LSC declared its intention to improve the quality and sufficiency of the provision for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. I said more about that in my earlier remarks.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC362"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000063"></a>The duties of the LSC under the Disability Discrimination Act and Sections 13 and 14 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 are also relevant to the issue of consultation with disabled learners and potential learners raised by Amendments Nos. 34 and 35. FE institutions also have duties under the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000064"></a>Through its consultation with partner bodies, surveys of learners and with the input from learner panels, the LSC will seek and obtain the views and active participation of the full range of learners and the different modes of learning. That will include disabled learners. The LSC is in the process of setting up a separate national learner panel for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities. It may help if I write to Members of the Committee to set out the arrangements that we intend for that.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000065"></a>The LSC will publish its own guidance for all FE providers on developing learner involvement strategies, which will include examples of good practice on learner consultation, including meeting the needs of learners and potential learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000066"></a>Drafts of the statutory guidance&#151;to which the LSC will be under a duty to have regard, and to which FE institutions must have regard&#151;have been made available to the Committee. We believe that this guidance is sufficiently explicit in meeting the needs of disabled learners that further provisions in the Bill are not required. Through consultation and surveys, and with the input from learner forums, the institution will seek and obtain the views and active participation of the full range of learners and potential learners, and that is to include disabled learners.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000067"></a>In respect of transport, a point raised in the discussion, local authorities have a duty to ensure that transport provision is made for learners with learning difficulties and disabilities to attend FE institutions up to the age of 19, or up to 21 if they started the course before their 19th birthday. Guidance also recommends that local authorities should continue to make provision for transport for all learners with learning difficulties and disabilities up to the age of 25. I hope that meets the points which have been raised in the debate.</p>

Everyone involved talks about a plethora of initiatives, and what is exciting and new tends to attract more funding and is more focused. Earlier we had a debate in which the Minister conceded the point and changed a &#147;may&#148; to a &#147;must&#148; because we were told that perhaps it was not robust enough in guidelines and secondary legislation, and therefore should be in the Bill. We think this is too important to be set out anywhere other than in primary legislation. However, for the time being I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000072"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 6 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC363"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07012374000073"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0008.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07012374000180"></a>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> In the absence of my friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, who is unable to be here today, I wish to oppose Clause 6. As the Minister is aware, it was the hope that amendments would be moved from the Bench of Bishops to ensure that the duties of the LSC and colleges included securing provision for the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development&#151;SMSC in its shortened form&#151;of young people in further education colleges on the same basis as those in schools. At the very minimum, we had hoped to ensure that the entitlement of all 16 to 19 year-olds to provision for their spiritual and moral welfare was extended to and guaranteed for those in FE colleges.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000074"></a>I shall not repeat in full the arguments put so eloquently by colleagues on the Bench of Bishops in earlier debates, but the anomaly I am addressing now is due, I realise, more to historical circumstances than to any intention on the part of governments to exclude young people studying in colleges from this important area of educational provision. At the time when much of the legislation governing further education was introduced, the majority of students were apprentices receiving day release technical training in colleges, but as we all know that is far from being the case today. Some 43 per cent of the age cohort of 16 to 19 year-olds are in colleges, and the vast majority of those are on full-time courses. They are young adults, just as sixth-formers are young adults, and subject to exactly the same pressures as sixth-formers. Indeed, because of the different social and ethnic profile of FE students from those in schools, they are likely to be under more pressure as a result of deprived or disadvantaged backgrounds, and they are also more likely to be from different ethnic or faith backgrounds, which may mean that there are added community or intergenerational pressures.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000075"></a>The present lack of entitlement is, in my view, selling these young people short. As a questioner to the Secretary of State put it at the Association of Colleges&#146; annual conference last November, &#147;Don&#146;t FE students have souls?&#148;. I believe they do, and I think that many noble Lords will agree. After discussions with many interested parties, including FE college principals, the National Ecumenical Agency in Further Education and the Faiths in FE Forum, as well as with the Government advisers on this Bill, my Episcopal colleagues developed amendments in two alternative forms in order to offer options which would keep as close as possible to the spirit of the Bill and the White Paper that preceded it. </p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000076"></a>Our first option was to make it a duty on the governing bodies of colleges to ensure that provision for students&#146; spiritual, moral, social and cultural development was made. The other option focused on the entitlement of FE students to SMSC and on the role of governing bodies in securing this entitlement. When it came to tabling such amendments, the advice given was that this Bill is a technical measure effecting certain changes to the structure and funding of FE, the LSC and colleges, and that such amendments would fall outside the scope of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000077"></a>That is a pity. The Bill is surely designed to put into effect the provisions of the White Paper, which  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC364"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC364</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>referred to students&#146; faith needs. Our proposed amendments were designed to ensure that students&#146; faith needs are met, including their broader spiritual and moral needs. The extension of SMSC to FE is also incidentally supported by the British Humanist Association, as well as leaders of other faiths. The Minister&#146;s officials helpfully made available to us the draft statutory guidance relating to the duty of consultation under the Bill, which refers to students&#146; spiritual and faith needs. However, that reference is made only in the context of pastoral provision. Effective provision for students&#146; spiritual and moral development should influence the whole learning and skills experience of students in colleges. It is therefore essential that there is some statutory underpinning for this entitlement.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000078"></a>Therefore, I ask the Minister to look very seriously at this question and to explore the possibility of amendments along the lines of those we have suggested. If the proposed addition after Clause 5 is not acceptable, perhaps an amendment to Clause 6 on diversity of provision, or to Clause 7 on consultation, would be considered. The truth is that we would welcome the Minister&#146;s guidance on all these matters. </p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000079"></a>Recent speculation about the Government&#146;s future intentions for education policy has focused on the possible raising of the effective leaving age for compulsory education and training to 18. For certain students, often from less privileged backgrounds, to continue to be deprived of care for spiritual and moral development in such circumstances would be more than an anomaly; it would be a scandal. I hope that the Government&#146;s concern, as expressed by the Minister in his speech at Second Reading, for the SMSC needs of FE students, can find practical expression in the framework of what my colleagues and I believe is in almost all other respects an excellent and ground-breaking Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000080"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07012374000181"></a>Lord Northbourne:</b> I also tried but failed to get the Public Bill Office to accept an amendment. It was not in exactly the same terms as the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment, nor was there any connivence between us in the matter, as I did not know that he was trying to do so. I intended to introduce an object clause before Clause 1 and was frustrated in that objective by the Public Bill Office. I thank the noble Lord for sending me the Keeling schedules, which unfortunately arrived only yesterday evening. It occurs to me that I might, at the next stage of the Bill, table an amendment requiring all FE colleges and the Department for Education and Skills to set homework at least three days before it is due to be handed in.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000081"></a>The problem with this Bill is that it has no mission statement. The Bill creates a powerful quango to control further education, and it gives the Secretary of State power to direct a great many things on what that quango shall and shall not do. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred to the Bill being bereft of declaratory duties. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, pointed out in speaking to Amendment No. 19 that the Secretary of State seems to have unfettered  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC365"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC365</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>powers, subject to no clear, stated parameters. That is my fundamental problem, because there is a danger of misunderstanding here.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000082"></a>Traditionally, further education has been environment-oriented by teaching skills for the job, providing mainly adult education and for those coming out of school at 16 and in need of further specific skills for employment. Now I understand that the Government&#146;s vision for further education, and rightly so in my view, includes a new element: those young people aged from 14 to 19 who have rejected, fallen out of or have been excluded from the school system. They hope that these young people may be drawn back into mainstream education, citizenship and employment. That is a wholly desirable objective. It is, however, a significant development in the concept of further education.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000083"></a>My concern is that the Bill should ensure that the LSC and the Secretary of State provide adequately for the needs of young people who have fallen out of the school system, particular those who have done so because of family dysfunction, which has left them inadequately prepared to cope with adult life in terms of lack of self-confidence, lack of social and communication skills or, to put it another way, a lack of emotional literacy and relationship skills. What the Bill does not do is to spell out the mission or objectives which should inform the policies of the LSC and the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000084"></a>I believe that the Government&#146;s objectives for the Bill are twofold; indeed, I hope they are. The first is to continue to help as many individuals as possible between the ages of 14 and 65 to obtain gainful employment. The second is to pick up young people over the age of 14 for whom the school is not well suited and to help them learn to cope with the challenges and opportunities of adult life, including, but not restricted to, gaining employment. That would include, for example, the challenges of becoming a good citizen and a good parent, so breaking the cycle of deprivation to which their families have been subject. This latter objective particularly concerns me because so many of these young people have needs which will not be adequately addressed by the traditional further education model.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000085"></a>As often as not, young people who fall out of the school system do so because they have not learnt within their families the emotional and relationship skills they need to cope with school. They are in the main deeply frustrated and angry at their own inability to succeed in a competitive society, and they are going to need help. It is crucially important that further education colleges should have facilities in the form of pastoral care and tutorial systems that support these young people in loco parentis, helping them to catch up on their socialisation and building their self-confidence, as well as learning specific skills. This may be their last chance.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000086"></a>I ask the Minister to agree to the inclusion in the Bill of a clear statement that further education institutions will have these duties. Following points I made at Second Reading the Minister was kind enough to write to me about all the things the Government are doing in respect of effective PSHE. I

Many colleges already have chaplaincies, but we feel that this provision should be available to all students. Spiritual and moral care brings enormous benefits to a student body and is a long-established part of higher education. The lack of statutory spiritual direction for FE colleges is an anomaly, and I hope that the Minister has listened carefully to the right reverend Prelate and will take on board these arguments.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000088"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07012374000183"></a>Lord Dearing:</b> I should like to say a few words in support of the arguments put forward by the right reverend Prelate. It is strange that where the Bill states that its purpose is to do this, that and the other&#151;one of which is to make provision for institutions within the further education sector&#151;it is not possible within the scope of this legislation to deal with the issues raised here. I agree that most of it is about financial and technical matters. But, as I read it, the purpose of the Bill should enable this to be covered. It is not a case of the faith groups versus the rest. At Second Reading, I was particularly impressed, and said so, that the humanists are on the list. This is not about religion, it is about the well-being of the whole human being. It would be a pity if this could not be considered because it is outside the scope of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000089"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07012374000184"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> In response to the right reverend Prelate, we believe that further education colleges should take the moral and spiritual well-being of students seriously. Indeed, the great majority of them do, but we believe that it should be taken seriously by all colleges. However, we do not think that imposing a wide-ranging duty on the Learning and Skills Council or FE colleges is an appropriate way forward. Young people at college are young adults. Their needs are different to pre-16 learners. Because it is difficult to separate out the general duties of a school for pre- and post-16 learners, the general duty in the Education and Inspections Act in respect of schools applies to school sixth forms. But we do not believe that it is appropriate to impose this same duty on all post-16 institutions which do not have students below the age of 16. This issue is best addressed on a non-statutory basis. Indeed, it is being so addressed by all the partners engaged in the faith communities and further education.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000090"></a>A good deal is already happening in FE to encourage and support colleges meeting spiritual and faith needs. A range of guidance has been produced, including guidance to leaders in further education on their responsibilities and specific guidance on multi-faith chaplaincy services, an issue raised by the noble Baroness. In addition, the draft statutory guidance for colleges on consulting learners and employers reinforces this point. This supports Clause 21 and has  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC367"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been made available in advance to Members of the Committee. It includes a section on consulting learners about their faith and spiritual needs. We believe that strengthening the learner voice is a critical way of achieving our shared objectives in this area.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000091"></a>However, I should like to add an important rider to my response so far. As the right reverend Prelate may be aware, the National Ecumenical Agency in Further Education is carrying out a national review of opportunities for spiritual and moral development in the further education sector. It will review current provision, make an assessment of the needs of students in further education in relation to spiritual and moral development and will propose a framework for meeting these needs. We look forward to receiving the National Ecumenical Agency&#146;s report later in the year and we will consider any further national initiatives or policy that are appropriate when we have considered that report. I should add that we would welcome the views of the right reverend Prelate, his fellow Bishops and other noble Lords when this report is available.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000097"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012374000190"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I take the points made by the noble Lord and I will reply to them more fully, but it should be made absolutely clear that in respect of 14 to 16 year-olds who may spend part of their time in a further education college, it is a requirement that they must still be based in a school. The school has responsibility for their pastoral care and they will not spend more than a minority of their time in an FE college. I should emphasise this because it is important to understand the relationship between FE colleges and students below the age of 16. FE colleges do not take responsibility for the pastoral care or organisation of that provision of 14 to 16 year-olds. That is not to say that they should not regard themselves as under duties to promote well-being, but the statutory responsibility of promoting the pastoral well-being of students of this age resides with the school, on whose roll these students will remain. The school is expected to exercise in full the duties in respect of these students.</p>

I am also grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and to the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, for their support and the points they contributed to the debate. I have to confess that I am slightly disappointed with what the Minister has said, but remain intrigued by the possibilities that have now arisen. I look forward to hearing the results of the little inquiry that will be going on within his team. Meanwhile, on behalf of my colleagues on the Bench of Bishops, I hope that the discussions will continue and I look forward to later debates when we can address these issues again. For the moment, I withdraw my opposition to the Question that this clause should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000103"></a>Clause 7 [<I>Consultation by the Council</I>]:</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC369"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07012374000104"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07012374000195"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford</b> moved Amendment No. 33:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012374000146"></a> Clause 7 , page 6, line 30, after &#147;receive&#148; insert &#147;part-time or full-time&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000105"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 7 concerns consultation procedures. Amendment No. 33 seeks to ensure that such consultation as takes place with students includes part-time as well as full-time students. As drafted, the clause does not specify this, and I hope that the Minister will assure us that there is no question of part-time students being ignored. But it is worth reminding the Committee that eight out of 10 students in further education colleges are adults, many of them studying part-time on day release or in the evening, and are therefore often a somewhat less visible presence in FE colleges than the young people on full-time day courses. Part-time students are an important constituency for further education and it is vital that they be consulted.</p>
<h5><a name="07012374000158"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000106"></a>Amendment No. 35 adds a rider to this consultation process and leaves the door open for consultation with other groups besides students and employers, both of whom are specified in Clause 7. In particular, it is surely sensible also to consult those who deliver our system of further education; that is, the teachers and lecturers who form the backbone of the labour force in further education colleges. There has been a tendency to ignore the voice of those who are now pejoratively called &#147;producer interests&#148;. They not only are often the main deliverers of the service, but, as my noble friend Lady Walmsley mentioned, they also bear the brunt of the funding gap that exists between schools and colleges. Partly as a result of the funding gap, many of these teachers and lecturers face larger teaching loads and their salaries are often lower than those of their counterparts in schools.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000107"></a>However, there are two good reasons why they should be consulted about developments in further education. First, in schools, the Government have recognised that the quality of education will not improve unless there is a dialogue between the DfES, the employers and the teacher unions on raising standards. This dialogue has successfully delivered a mechanism for continuing professional development for teachers, which understands the many forms of training that can be adopted&#151;not just going on courses. This contrasts with the approach in further education where the Government have proposed a blanket requirement for continuing professional development (CPD) of 30 hours a year without any regard to the experience, expertise or effectiveness of practice in that sector.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000108"></a>Secondly, the new specialist diplomas that will come on stream in 2008, which are the key to the Government&#146;s drive to improve the skills base of the nation, will require further education teachers and lecturers to be able to adopt appropriate pedagogical practices to meet the needs and maturity levels of students in the 14 to 16 age range who they have not traditionally been teaching. Neither the Bill nor the Foster report mention pedagogy, but in this respect CPD will be vital.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC370"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC370</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000109"></a>A third group, the voluntary sector, merits some input into any consultation process. A significant amount of specialist post-16 education and training is delivered by voluntary organisations such as the WEA or is delivered with substantial advice and guidance from such organisations as the RNIB, Scope and the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education. This reflects the enormous range and circumstances of older learners. If they are excluded from consultations with the LSC, their expertise on these specialised subjects would be missed. In conclusion, these two amendments would extend the process of consultation to a number of groups which in other respects may be ignored by the Learning and Skills Council. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000110"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0009.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07012374000196"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has mentioned three very important groups&#151;part-time students, the very hard-working staff in our FE colleges and those in the voluntary sector who deliver so very much in this country. I cannot believe for one moment that they would not be consulted.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000111"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0009.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07012374000197"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has said, part-time students are the lifeblood of many colleges. Sections 2 and 3 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 make it clear that post-16 education and training includes full-time and part-time students. A draft of the statutory guidance which this clause proposes that the LSC must have regard to in consulting employers and learners has been made available to the Committee. This guidance is intended to cover both full and part-time learners, but I am happy to look again at whether this should be made explicit in the guidance. In our view, it would be hard to interpret it in any way that did not include part-timers, but I will look again at that specific issue.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000112"></a>In addition to the statutory guidance, the LSC will publish its own guidance for all further education providers on developing learner involvement strategies. That will include examples of good practice on learner consultation. The LSC is also developing the framework for excellence, which will monitor the responsiveness of providers to learners and employers. Through its consultation with partner bodies, surveys of learners, and with the input from the learner panels, the LSC will seek and obtain the views and active participation of the full range of learners and the range of different modes of learning. That will include, in an absolutely central way, part-timers.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000113"></a>We have considerable sympathy with the intention behind Amendment No. 35, but we are not clear what it would add in practice. The Learning and Skills Council, in exercising its existing functions, already widely consults a number of organisations responsible for employment, development, education and skills, such as local authorities and regional development authorities, and we are keen to see that continue. Clause 7 is intended to ensure that those who benefit from our investment in learning have their voices heard in matters that affect them. This clause imposes an express duty on the LSC to have  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC371"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column GC371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regard to guidance about it. However, beyond those chief categories of learners and employers, we feel that it should be for the LSC to decide whom to consult, having regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State. At the moment, we are not persuaded that putting further categories in the Bill would be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000114"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07012374000198"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> I am not persuaded by that argument. I cannot see what harm is being done. As the noble Lord said, the Bill refers to &#147;must have regard to&#148;, so it is not imposing an obligation to consult those bodies, though they would have to take into account what the Minister says. I cannot quite see the logic of his argument.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000115"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0009.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07012374000199"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The question is whether it is necessary. We regard the Learning and Skills Council as a competent body decide which further categories it should consult, over and above those key, essential categories of learners and employers. As I said, I will happily reflect further on the remarks of the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, to see whether we think it is appropriate to make further changes.</p>

<p><a name="07012374000116"></a><b><a name="70123-gc0009.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07012374000200"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I had expected him to say very firmly that part-time students were included in the category in proposed new subsection (1)(a). Amendment No. 35 does not specify this. I suggested that two groups that may be considered were employees&#151;teachers and lecturers&#151;on one hand, and voluntary organisations on the other. We were suggesting widening the terms of the consultation a little bit by adding,</p>
<ul><a name="07012374000152"></a>&#147;such other bodies as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012374000135"></a>Perhaps the Minister is saying that he does not think the Secretary of State should lay down whom the LSC should consult; he thinks the LSC should decide for itself whom it consults. Nevertheless, Clause 7 refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="07012374000153"></a>&#147;guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012374000136"></a>and it might be that the Secretary of State wishes to remind the LSC that there are a number of partners and stakeholders in the process that might be consulted. It seems to me that it is a relatively innocuous amendment, and it might be one that the noble Lord would incorporate.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012374000147"></a> After Clause 9 , insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07012374000148"></a>&#147;Directions</p>

</ul>
<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000124"></a>The noble Lord said: We have set out our expectation that, in the normal course of events, the Learning and Skills Council will be responsible deciding whether to establish or dissolve further education institutions. We believe that those activities sit firmly within the LSC&#146;s planning activities. We have, however, included in the Bill provision for the Secretary of State to intervene and to direct the Learning and Skills Council regarding its powers and duties under Sections 16 and 27 to establish and dissolve further education corporations. We want to ensure that the Secretary of State retains a reserve power to act; and we would be rightly criticised if legislation were drafted leaving the Secretary of State powerless to act in cases as important as these.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000125"></a>However, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee raised concerns about the loss of parliamentary scrutiny as a result of the transfer of the Secretary of State's powers to establish and dissolve institutions to the Learning and Skills Council. In particular, the committee was concerned about the lack of constraint on the Secretary of State&#146;s power to direct the Learning and Skills Council in the exercise of its order-making powers, with the LSC being obliged to comply with any such directions.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000126"></a>In response to those concerns, we have tabled the amendment. We now propose that Clause 16, which sets out broad powers to enable the Secretary of State to direct the LSC in relation to the establishment or dissolution of further education corporations, should not stand part of the Bill. Instead, we propose to use the Secretary of State's existing powers of direction set out in Section 25 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 as amended by this clause.</p>

<a name="70123-gc0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07012374000127"></a>The amendment will ensure that only where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the Learning and Skills Council has acted or proposes to act unreasonably can he issue a direction to it in relation to the exercise of its powers under Sections 16 or 27 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Accordingly, the Secretary of State would be able to intervene by making a direction only where he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to do so. That is a significant change in the way in which the power is framed and is a direct response to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I hope that the Committee will find it welcome. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="07012363000010"></a><b><a name="70123-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07012363000045"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Peter Hain) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07012363000011"></a>This Statement sets out how the Government intend to take forward the recommendations from the Independent Strategic Review of Education in Northern Ireland, which was led by Professor Sir George Bain. The review report was published on 4 December. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07012363000012"></a>If Northern Ireland is to maximise the skills, the talent and the commitment to rise to the challenges of improving the economy and be truly world class, it will require reform to the education system. That is why last year the Government asked Sir George Bain to carry out an independent review. The review&#146;s focus was on the quality of education of children and has recommended overall an estate of fewer, larger schools characterised by greater collaboration and integration across sectors, with better strategic planning of the schools estate. The review sets out educational, social and economic arguments for change.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07012363000013"></a>The 61 recommendations in the review report&#151;all of which the Government have accepted&#151;taken together offer a strategy for how best to use resources to maximise their contribution towards delivering a world-class education while remaining focused on meeting the educational needs of young people. It will take time to realise the full benefits of change.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07012363000014"></a>The review report recommends that the education system should move to a system of area-based planning which would tackle the problems of overprovision and lack of co-ordination created by the current system. Strong, clear and coherent planning is crucial and the new Education and Skills Authority, to be established as part of the reforms of public administration in Northern Ireland, will play the central role in drawing up proposals for area plans for each of the seven coterminous new strategic local authorities. The further education and schools sectors also need to work together on provision for the local area.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07012363000015"></a>The review highlighted the benefits of having strong schools that are educationally and financially viable for the long term. The review recommended  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS58"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column WS58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>new minimum threshold enrolments for primary and post-primary schools and for sixth forms, below which the provision should be reviewed. Changes will be planned carefully and sensitively and will take time, with the educational interests of pupils remaining paramount. The Government are issuing a policy paper for consultation, incorporating the recommended minimum enrolments from the report.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07012363000016"></a>It is important that investment in the schools estate supports well developed area plans that reflect local needs. No new school building projects will be announced unless they are compatible with area-based planning. Projects already under way will need to be reviewed so that they are consistent with the recommendations of the review.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07012363000017"></a>In response to the review, the Government will examine the way in which individual schools are funded. The factors that make up the local management of schools common funding formula will be reviewed to make sure that they reflect and are responsive to the main costs faced by schools. There should be a greater level of delegation to schools, giving power to school leaders.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07012363000018"></a>Northern Ireland has, and will continue to have, a diverse education system that acknowledges the wishes of parents to have their children educated in settings that reflect their own individual values and beliefs. Many schools are already working tirelessly to foster and help nurture mutual understanding and mutual respect. The review recommended the provision of tangible support to schools that are actively engaged in sharing with other schools, or schools that are developing an inclusive environment in recognition of the diversity of their pupils&#146; religious, cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The Government have decided that schools in all sectors will be able to apply for a new, shared future accreditation, developed with the sectors and a kitemark for tolerance and sharing, which will bring with it some additional financial and other support.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07012363000019"></a>The recommendations set out in the review report provide a solid foundation for shaping future policy. They will act as a catalyst to change the way in which Government plan and fund education. They will lead to a stronger and more coherent strategic framework for planning and developing the schools estate, and they will promote greater collaboration and sharing, delivering educational and wider societal benefits in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07012363000021"></a>This Statement sets out the Government&#146;s final response to the recommendations of the Commission on Boundary Differences and Voting Systems under the chairmanship of Sir John Arbuthnott. Its report, <I>Putting Citizens First: Boundaries, Voting and Representation in Scotland</I>, was presented on 19 January 2006 to my predecessor as Secretary of State for

The Scottish Executive are today issuing separately their response to the recommendations that relate to their responsibilities.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07012363000022"></a>The commission was set up in the middle of 2004 following the decisions taken by Parliament regarding the reduction in the number of Scottish MPs and subsequently the retention of the original size of the Scottish Parliament. Its establishment took into account also the decision by the Scottish Parliament to introduce the single transferable vote (STV) for the next Scottish local government elections in May 2007. Its remit was to examine the consequences of having four different voting systems in local and parliamentary elections in Scotland and different boundaries between the Westminster and Scottish Parliament constituencies.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07012363000023"></a>The commission was asked in particular to make recommendations on whether any action needed to be taken in respect of:</p>
arrangements between elected representatives;electoral boundaries;relationships with other public bodies and authorities; andthe method of voting in Scottish Parliament elections.
<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07012363000024"></a>Its wide-ranging report is a thorough piece of work that shows careful attention to the issues and raises a number of important concerns, which have been debated in this House on a number of occasions since publication.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07012363000025"></a>We are now in a position to respond to the recommendations made in the report. Not all of these were for the Government to consider, some being for the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Parliament or the Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07012363000026"></a>I note that the commission confirmed that having different boundaries between the constituencies of this House and those of the Scottish Parliament is not a matter that requires further action and should not drive change at this time to the electoral system for the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07012363000027"></a>The commission recommended that there should be greater alignment between the Scottish Parliament constituencies and local authority areas in Scotland. Any action that might need to be taken by the Government will depend on the outcome of work being taken forward by the Executive. Consideration of possible new structures for the regions for Scottish Parliament elections and the future review of constituency boundaries would also follow from this.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07012363000028"></a>The Government are pleased that the commission&#146;s conclusions generally support the operation of the additional member system (AMS) for electing members to the Scottish Parliament, which will remain the system to be used in the next elections in May 2007.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07012363000029"></a>The Scotland Office consulted in June 2006 on the commission&#146;s recommendation that the ballot papers for Scottish Parliament elections should be redesigned in order to improve voter understanding of AMS. I  


<notus-date day="23" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS60"></a><b>23 Jan 2007 : Column WS60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>announced on 22 November 2006 that the two separate ballot papers used in previous Scottish Parliament elections would be replaced for the elections in May 2007 by a single paper, with the left side listing the parties standing for election as regional MSPs and the right side the candidates standing as constituency MSPs.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07012363000030"></a>We do not propose to replace the present method of electing regional members with open lists, believing that this would overcomplicate the voting system.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07012363000031"></a>We note the commission&#146;s recommendation strongly in favour of allowing a candidate both to stand in a constituency and to be on a regional list, and following this have no plans to introduce any change in this area for elections to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07012363000032"></a>The coupling of the Scottish local government elections with those for the Scottish Parliament is a matter for Scottish Ministers and that Parliament.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07012363000033"></a>Introducing the single transferable vote for European Parliament elections for Scotland would not be novel, since this is the system already used in Northern Ireland. However, we do not at this time believe that there is a strong enough case for changing the voting system in Scotland for elections to the European Parliament. There would need to be strong reasons to diverge from the system used in the rest of Great Britain. None is immediately apparent.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07012363000034"></a>The recommendation on electronic counting and electronic voting is in line with the modernising process of the electoral system that the Government are pursuing. E-counting is already being planned for the Holyrood and Scottish local government elections in May 2007.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07012363000035"></a>The recommendations on the conduct and functions of constituency and regional MSPs are matters for the Scottish Parliament to consider.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="07012363000036"></a>The recommendation that young people leaving school should have a good understanding of voting and parliamentary democracy is a matter for the Scottish Executive.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="07012363000037"></a>We support the intention behind the recommendations regarding providing further public information on voting arrangements before each election and on the elected representatives after them. However, these are matters for the Electoral Commission to take forward in the first instance. Its public awareness campaign for the 2007 elections will provide information on these elections and the voting systems that will be used.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="07012363000038"></a>The text of each of the 24 recommendations made by the Arbuthnott commission, with the Government&#146;s responses to these, is available on the Scotland Office website.</p>

<a name="70123-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="07012363000039"></a>In conclusion, I must thank the Commission on Boundary Differences and Voting Systems for its work and report.</p>

We sought to consult widely with the UK chemicals industry and other sectors that will be affected by REACH to ensure that their views were taken into account and that they were kept informed of developments throughout the legislative process.</p>

<a name="70123w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="07012364000071"></a>In October 2006, I announced that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) would act as the UK competent authority for the implementation of REACH. The HSE has set up a helpdesk to provide assistance and advice to all industrial sectors on the requirements of REACH. Various industry bodies are also taking active steps to make sure that companies understand about REACH and have access to advice.</p>

<a name="70123w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="07012364000072"></a>The Government are confident that there is a widespread understanding of REACH and its requirements among the major industrial players. However, we are less confident that there is such an understanding among the significant numbers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and among companies not in the chemical industry but which nevertheless use chemicals. With the formal adoption of the REACH regulation in December 2006, we are developing a communications strategy to ensure that SMEs in particular are fully aware of REACH requirements as they progressively come into effect from 1 June 2007.</p>

We will be looking to accelerate negotiations on future action by demonstrating clear EU leadership through securing an agreement on tough greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals for the EU and using the EU and G8 fora to seek high-level agreement on the elements that should form the basis of a future framework.</p>

<a name="70123w0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a><a name="07012364000077"></a>We announced a new Climate Change Bill, which will put into statute the Government's long-term goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2050 and set out a framework for achieving this. This will also strengthen our ability to be global leaders in a future international framework for climate change.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a><a name="07012364000079"></a>Although unilateral linking is currently possible, mutual recognition of such schemes would require an amendment to the directive. This is being considered as one of the UK's priorities for the Commission's review of the emissions trading directive. The Government support the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS and will be working with the Commission and other member states during negotiation of the directive on inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a><a name="07012364000082"></a>Erosion risk will vary around the coastline depending on local conditions and defences in place. Defra has encouraged the relevant authorities to produce shoreline management plans (SMPs), which provide large-scale assessments of the risks associated with coastal processes and present long-term policy frameworks to manage these risks in a sustainable manner.</p>

<a name="70123w0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a><a name="07012364000083"></a>In 2001, Defra funded a national study of information on long-term coastal processes and evolution over the next century (Futurecoast). This is designed to be used by coastal authorities to inform their current revisions of SMPs. The Department of Trade and Industry's <I>Foresight: Future Flooding</I> report, published in 2004, also considered possible coastal erosion scenarios over the following 80 years.</p>

<a name="70123w0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="07012364000084"></a>Work under the cross-government Making Space for Water programme is focusing on methods for mapping erosion probabilities with the aim of producing national maps of coastal erosion probability in 2009, similar to those currently available for flood risk. Further work within this programme is looking at the national scale of the problems, with a view to considering future options for adaptation policy.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="07012364000085"></a>Funding for flood and coastal erosion risk management has increased significantly in recent years. New approaches to management of the risk in a broad sense are being considered under Making Space for Water. They include proposals for new outcome measures, on which we are currently out to public consultation, and for the Environment Agency to have a strategic overview of all coastal flood and erosion risk management.</p>

In line with civil police guidelines, witness interviews are audio recorded. On rare occasions where this is not possible, comprehensive notes are maintained.

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) already has discretion to disclose information about awards made for injuries inflicted by the same offender, provided that the authority is satisfied that any disclosure is unlikely to enable a particular victim, or the award made to a particular victim, to be identified. For example, CICA has disclosed more general information about awards made to victims of the late Harold Shipman and to victims of the 7/7 London bombings. It follows that CICA cannot release information relating to the second Question, including whether any applications for criminal injuries compensation have in fact been made in the Leslie Warren and Warren Blackwell cases.</p>

It also works to stimulate the development and growth of local businesses and entrepreneurial activity. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) works to secure investment in tourism. Invest NI works closely with local stakeholders to encourage them to develop regional propositions to maximise the attractiveness of their area for potential investors.</p>

<a name="70123w0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_126"></a><a name="07012364000238"></a>This strategy has resulted in just under &#163;5 million of assistance being offered towards total planned inward investment of &#163;19.2 million in the Strabane District Council area in the four years to March 2006. Through its Accelerating Entrepreneurship Strategy, Invest NI has also assisted the creation of just under 270 new enterprises which have the potential to generate significant additional turnover in local businesses.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_127"></a><a name="07012364000239"></a>The NITB has prepared a strategic framework for action 2004-07 to focus on attracting visitors to NI, to increase the competitiveness of tourism businesses and to stimulate effective communication with the industry. Four regional tourism partnerships (RTPs) were set up under the framework to assist the promotion of tourism at local level. The Western RTP, which includes North Tyrone, has to date been allocated &#163;125,000, representing 25 per cent of the &#163;500,000 funding from the NITB towards this initiative. Projects from North Tyrone have also been eligible to compete for funding under the tourism development programme.</p>

A second new flyover is planned for Dromore Road at the northern end of the Banbridge bypass and a second new underpass is planned for Dublin Road at the southern end of the Loughbrickland bypass.
