<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What proposals they have to deliver foreign language training to members of the United Kingdom Diplomatic Service.</p>

<a name="07050230000012"></a><b><a name="70502-0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07050230000646"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Triesman):</b> My Lords, excellent foreign language skills remain essential for all British diplomats. We are introducing a new language-training policy after extensive consultation within the FCO. We will require heads of mission to be trained to a level where they can communicate fluently, locally and with the media, as many now can. Our training and examinations will align to a recognised international standard. More time will be spent overseas learning languages. Our teaching in the UK will become more flexible and cost-effective as we source our services from private-sector providers.</p>

Will he give an assurance that the commercialisation of the FCO language services will result in greater efficiency and effectiveness and not be a cost-cutting exercise? Will he give further assurances, perhaps with a Statement to this House at a later date, that the security and maintenance of these services will be maintained at a time when Britain sorely needs such language skills to protect itself at home and to promote businesses and diplomacy abroad?</p>

We have a history of good language training, but it is not entirely efficient&#151;it certainly could be done more efficiently. It is not sufficiently flexible for the users, whose needs must be paramount on occasion, and sometimes the provision is not as efficient as it ought to be. In some languages, for example, we use just 11 per cent of a teacher&#146;s capacity, and the highest use is 55 per cent. We can do a lot better for those learning the languages, and we can certainly sustain the overall spread of the languages, which we unquestionably need. They should be usable in all the circumstances that my noble friend described.</p>

I did not really think that it was necessary. I have a daughter in the Foreign Office who learnt Swahili before her posting abroad, and she seems to speak it very well. Does the Minister think the Foreign Office could teach her to speak English now that she has come back after four years in New York?</p>

Embedded in that, however, there is a significant point. Sometimes diplomats spend not just years but decades abroad, and are not as familiar with the country they represent, whether in terms of language or anything else, as they might be if they were back here a little more often,. One of the points about flexibility is to ensure that those who represent us abroad not only speak languages, but speak authoritatively for our language and culture.</p>

Is co-operation with non-profit private-sector providers such as universities, which teach a whole range of foreign languages and which are also often understaffed, taking place?, Given that moves in the NHS to private-sector providers have sometimes cost more than public-service providers, can we be assured that we are looking for cost-effective provision rather than just moving to the private sector?</p>

<a name="07050230000018"></a><b><a name="70502-0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07050230000652"></a>Lord Triesman:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord knows from his experience, perhaps rather like mine, that whether universities are in the private or public sector is sometimes hard to define. I can certainly give the assurance he seeks, though. One of the reasons why I am confident that standards can be of the highest level is that I expect some of the providers to be institutions that are exactly like SOAS, where the record for doing this kind of work at the highest international levels is so great. We must make use of those kinds of resources in the mix. They are capable of offering what we need.</p>

I am glad that under the new arrangements that figure will increase still further. Does the Minister agree that, for the Diplomatic Service, professional language skills have never been more important than they are now? Does he also agree that for that and other reasons it is extraordinarily important that the Diplomatic Service and the Foreign Office get a good settlement from the present Comprehensive Spending Review negotiations?</p>

It is vital that we speak all the languages that are required. It is not just a courtesy to the countries concerned but enables us to have a range of understanding. More flexible language teaching could achieve an even stronger idiomatic sense of a language and the culture from which it springs.</p>

If that can be enhanced by the programmes that we now plan, it would be a great advantage.</p>

For instance, I have in mind improving languages in environmental policy where we need to speak to new colleagues in the world. Can he ensure that the process is accelerated to make sure that there is a proper match with Britain&#146;s needs in a contemporary world?</p>

As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, there is much knowledge of the way these things are developing and of the sorts of issues which must be addressed by a language in a particular context. Therefore, there is every prospect of our being able to build on what we have done and to enhance precisely the areas that my noble friend described. It is a matter not simply of having a larger lexicon, although that helps, but of understanding the real relevance of the discussions that people want to have with us.</p>

The new asylum model became fully operational in March 2007, so meaningful data on decision quality for non-detained routes are not expected to be available before the autumn. Up to 20 per cent of all decisions will be assessed against criteria designed with UNHCR.</p>

But the question for me is whether the NAM is prejudging asylum seekers. From what I hear, case workers are still inadequately trained and underinformed. Does she agree that the cards are stacking up against genuine asylum seekers? I include here the merits test and the lack of provision for legal aid. Some asylum seekers even go into hearings without any representation.</p>

The quality of the decision will be better. The training now comprises a 55-day foundation training programme. Higher executive officers will be responsible for making the decisions. They will track those decisions right the way through and have ownership. We believe that that is a much better system, which will develop high quality. Legal assistance is available.</p>

The quality of the person making the decision will be greatly enhanced, because they will be better trained and at a higher level, and there will be continuity from beginning to end. The noble Baroness will know that one of the challenges has been that the procedures have been passed from one body to another. Continuity is a matter of real importance, and this model delivers it.</p>

The noble Lord may not be aware that those matters are being appealed, so I can say nothing at all about them. In relation to in-country reports, the answer is yes. As I said earlier, one of the very important things about making sure that the training is greatly improved and enhanced is to enable those who come to make the decisions&#151;the case owners&#151;to do so on an informed and intelligent basis that is intelligible not only to them but to anyone else who may review the efficacy of the decision.</p>

We were given what many of us considered a very unsatisfactory answer the other day about the possible asylum applications of people who had served as interpreters or drivers with forces in Iraq. Is there room in the new asylum model to pay particular attention to those whose lives may have been placed in danger by their assistance to British troops and others in difficult circumstances?</p>

In 1997, we used to take about 20 to 22 months to deal with applications; we are now dealing with most of them within seven months and some, under the new model, within two. That makes a major contribution for those who are validly applying for asylum and, equally, for those who have no right to asylum and should be properly removed, which is, as my noble friend said, a concern for many.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="07050230000049"></a>Is the Minister fully aware of the huge importance of proper parliamentary scrutiny, not just of the result but also of the process? Is he aware that we have a very small window of opportunity between the European Council on 21 and 22 June and the parliamentary Recess which starts on 26 July? Does he agree that it is extremely important that we are kept fully informed of the process and, as it comes out from the discussions at intergovernmental level, the substance of the discussion? There is absolutely no point in our being able to debate the matter in Parliament after the IGC under the Portuguese presidency has met, when the stable door will have been closed. Will the Minister therefore agree that it is very important that, in the short interim before the Summer Recess, as much information as possible is given to us so that your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the European Union can begin looking at it and analysing what has been agreed?</p>

It is also important, however, as the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, reminded us, that we should have a full debate and not merely be told to discuss it when the matter is settled. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has said that the Government have made it clear that there should not be anything that has the characteristics of a constitution.

Our understanding is that the reported new procedures for the registration of NGOs do not appear to require established and registered NGOs to re-register. The impact on new NGOs is less clear. Our embassy is in constant touch with the NGO community in Zimbabwe, which provides essential support for millions of ordinary Zimbabweans, and we will monitor the situation closely. The increased uncertainty for NGOs is part of a wider picture of intimidation, violence and harassment of civil society in the run-up to the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2008. It runs contrary to the NePAD and SADC principles.</p>

They certainly fear that that is what is happening to them. It is damaging civil society, giving Mugabe political control over food distribution just before an election, and the NGOs are intimidated. They must fear that their overseas funds are going to dry up. They and the people see this action as one more assertion of ruthless power.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="07050230000064"></a>I am glad that the Minister has said that this is contrary to NePAD. Should not the AU be asked whether it condones this treatment of NGOs? This is the second time that they have been threatened in this way over the past two years. The AU also has NGOs. Does it want them to be treated in this way? Or does it want NGOs abroad to think that they would be treated in this way if they went to any country in Africa? It is a serious issue. There is general intimidation and fear. That fear runs right through civil society. I am sure that the Minister will agree that if intimidation and fear exist to that degree there is a real danger that Mugabe intends to annihilate the NGOs.</p>

In the run-up to the elections in 2005 we saw those organisations under terrible pressure, particularly those that promoted human or political rights. I would not rule out, whatever our knowledge of the apparent position today, that that may very well happen in the future. I am happy to give the House the assurance&#151;I suspect &#147;happy&#148; is not the right word in the circumstances, but I am most willing to give the assurance&#151;that those matters will be raised with the African Union, SADC and the regional bodies.

Does he not agree that the capricious licensing system used to stifle the freedoms of the press in Zimbabwe is not a good augury for what might happen to the NGOs? What does he make of the decision of the South African Broadcasting Corporation a few days ago to open an office in Zimbabwe, having instructed the network&#146;s news editors not to broadcast the views of Moeletsi Mbeki, Archbishop Pius Ncube and Eleanor Sisulu&#151;all prominent opponents of the Mugabe regime?</p>

I agree with that proposition wholeheartedly. I do not expect Robert Mugabe suddenly to embrace the concept of a free press any more than anybody else in your Lordships&#146; House does. The South Africans take their own decisions. We will continue to argue that they could take a more forward-leaning position.</p>

I assert that we show that interest for humanitarian reasons. It is nothing to do with the history. This generation in politics does not share that history. In the kind of package that we have all agreed and on which we worked with Kofi Annan when he was intending in the last days of his secretary-generalship to visit Zimbabwe, we envisaged a raft of economic measures that would also help to deal with some of those land resettlement questions. There has been no desire on the part of successive United Kingdom Governments to avoid doing so. What I think everyone has avoided is parcelling up money and giving it to Robert Mugabe to distribute as he chooses.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07050230000262"></a> Clause 7, page 5, line 33, at end insert &#147;(including, in particular, exceptional circumstances relating to lack of jurisdiction or error of law)&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70502-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="07050230000076"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, we return to Clause 7, as I indicated we would with the leave of the House, and I rise to move Amendment No. 1, to which the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, has added his name. I express my gratitude to noble Lords for their constructive discussions on the clause both inside and outside the House.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="07050230000077"></a>At earlier stages and in discussions outside, I explained the various reasons that prompted us to include Clause 7 and perhaps I may remind the House of them. We were conscious of the need to prevent disclosure of sensitive information that could put lives at risk. Three of the four conditions in the test for whether there will be a trial without a jury relate to paramilitary groups. That means that the case for non-jury trial will often involve sensitive intelligence material that raises national security issues.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="07050230000078"></a>If that material were exposed in open court, it would pose serious risks: such information could come out into the public domain; sources could become compromised, putting lives at risk; and in some cases it may not even be possible to admit that intelligence on a particular thing exists because, where there is a small circle of knowledge, it may be possible to identify a particular individual as the person who has passed that intelligence on. Techniques used for gathering intelligence in national security and serious crime cases could become compromised and so, too, could ongoing police investigations. Those are the reasons why it would be difficult, dangerous and undesirable to disclose such information openly.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07050230000079"></a>We therefore want to avoid sharing that material in open court in any challenge and so avoid opportunistic attempts to frustrate the judicial process by using judicial review as an attempt to force disclosure of material in the hope&#151;as happens in some cases&#151;that by doing so the prosecution will be forced to stop a case or deal with it in a way that is not in the best interests of justice because it cannot afford to respond to a requirement to disclose the material.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07050230000080"></a>However, it has never been the Government&#146;s intention to oust judicial review of the director&#146;s decision by the courts in appropriate cases. We have taken the view, as did the Court of Appeal in the case of Shuker, that it would likely be exceptional to do so. I am encouraged to think that there is now a substantial measure of agreement with that point of view within the House; indeed, all main opposition parties agree with it.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000246"></a>The amendment seeks to offer some comfort to noble Lords by confirming that challenge on these grounds will be possible, provided that it meets the threshold

It will obviously be for the courts to decide whether that threshold is met in any case. I want to make it clear that this does not mean that lack of jurisdiction or error of law will be exceptional circumstances in every case; that would be a matter for the courts to decide based on the arguments put to them. However, in the hope and belief that this amendment will find favour across the House, I beg to move.</p>

I would like first to say how grateful I am to him for having seen me, among others, to discuss the reasons for it. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which I serve, will, I am sure, be very glad that the matter has been clarified in this way. I entirely agree with what he has said about the need to avoid opportunistic judicial reviews going into the merits of the kind of cases that he describes.</p>

I am sure that that approach shows a proper respect for the rule of law. Like him, we believe that the courts of Northern Ireland have exercised their discretion in this and other areas admirably well.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07050230000084"></a>The advantage of the amendment is that it makes it quite clear that judicial review will be exceptional but will be fully available in cases involving not only dishonesty or bad faith. The reference to &#147;exceptional circumstances&#148; includes, as indeed one would expect, cases where there is a lack of jurisdiction or other significant error of law. For that reason, I very much support the amendment, and I am sure that the noble and learned Lord is right to say that there will be widespread support for it.</p>

At the same time, we must be able to protect those sources and those who work consistently in dangerous areas for the cause of justice within the judicial processes and the criminal research set-ups in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07050230000090"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I return to an issue that was touched on in Committee and on Report; that is, restorative justice schemes. Let me make it clear from the outset that I think that there is a place in the legal system for schemes of this nature. A range of issues can be effective in dealing with this. The concern that I have expressed and wish to repeat today is not against the concept of restorative justice, but a concern about how some such schemes might operate in practice in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07050230000091"></a>A general concern prompted the first amendment that I tabled on this subject. When we are dealing with part of the justice system, it is right that there should be a legal basis for it, no matter what the circumstances are. In that system, it is hugely important that people know where they stand, what their rights are and the procedures to which they may be subject. The best way to provide that assurance is by having a legal basis for the procedures. The Northern Ireland Office decided to have guidelines, which it has been consulting on for some time. As a matter of principle, I am not very comfortable with the concept of proceeding by guidelines because they do not give assurance and clarity to those who may be involved in the processes. The NIO has taken that approach and I have modified the amendments that I tabled with that in mind.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07050230000092"></a>I have made a further significant modification to the amendment that we discussed on Report. I was and still am concerned about the involvement in these schemes of former paramilitaries. I know Northern Ireland and the localities well. In some of these localities, one inevitably has to adjust and rub shoulders with the people who are there, who will often have paramilitary associations and backgrounds. Since the Belfast agreement, where paramilitary organisations have ended their campaigns and people have moved to the point of supporting the criminal justice system, there is a different context. None the less, it did not seem to me that that justified completely ignoring all the things that people might have done during those paramilitary campaigns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07050230000093"></a>From the point of view of trying to make progress, in this new clause I have decided to cut more with the grain of what the Government are proposing. The new clause provides a limited legal framework in requiring the Secretary of State to maintain a register and also providing, as the guidelines do, that the Criminal Justice Inspectorate will regularly inspect these schemes. I have tried to reinforce the position of the Criminal Justice Inspectorate in this context. I have every confidence in Mr Chivers, who heads that inspectorate, but it is desirable in his dealings with the people running these schemes that he is able to point to certain legislative provisions which reinforce his position, give him a right to make reports and recommendations and even to recommend that an organisation be removed from the register. That will strengthen his hand. He and his inspectorate are going to be our mainstay in trying to ensure that these schemes operate in a civilised and humane way.</p>

<a name="70502-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07050230000094"></a>I hope that the new clause will be just a beginning, as it were, because more is needed in this area to provide a degree of regulation. I tabled this reconsidered amendment in the hope that the Government and the House may be able to look more favourably upon it. I beg to move.</p>

The issue of community-based restorative justice systems is a long-running concern of my party. If Her Majesty&#146;s Government can accept the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, to which I have attached my name, as have the noble Lords, Lord Smith of Clifton and Lord Lester, that would put our minds considerably more at ease. The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, pointed out that there is a long way to go yet, but these are new schemes and systems and we shall have to monitor them carefully. Can the Minister give us an idea of what schemes are waiting to go through the protocol to be accepted by the Government? That would be interesting to know. If he can find a way to accept the amendment, that will be a wonderful finish to the Bill.</p>

I supported him in previous debates on the issue and am glad to add my name to the amendment. The key question is: what will best protect and strengthen community justice and the rule of law? The fact that the schemes are voluntary, community-based and address low-level criminal activity does not change the powerful influence that they will have on communities and the public role they undertake. That is especially relevant in the context of Northern Ireland, where, as the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, himself noted, the threat of instability and potential for paramilitary involvement is very real. The Government acknowledged that community-based restorative justice schemes should not be allowed to devolve into autonomous policing units. However, their view is that the NIO&#146;s protocol provides sufficient safeguards against abuse. We disagree, which is why we seek a statutory safeguard of a modest kind. The type of intermediary role played by these schemes constitutes  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1071"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1071</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a public activity that ought to be seen to be fair and impartial. Anything less threatens to compromise the justice that the community seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07050230000097"></a>The regulation of community-based restorative justice schemes is not a symptom of suspicion, nor do I ignore the contribution of the NIO protocol. Rather, the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, will ensure that the rule of law is not undermined and that the schemes are born of and exist subject to the rule of law. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has previously expressed concern that the work of the schemes, which engages the statutory sector, is limited to mediating, reparative interventions between the perpetrators and the victims of low-level crime in the local community. Even if, as he suggests, such work forms a small proportion of a scheme&#146;s activities, it must still be subject to the rule of law and protected against the abuse of power. The rule of law requires that these schemes are grounded in a legal basis, so that they do not suffer from the vice of informality with all the dangers that that implies. Although the NIO protocol may give guidance, it is not a statutory instrument. The amendment injects legal certainty into this area without falling into the trap of legalism or excessive regulation. It prescribes that accredited community-based restorative justice schemes are subject to inspection by the Criminal Justice Inspectorate, as he explained. Where the inspectorate deems it fit, it may recommend to the Secretary of state that the scheme be removed from the public register.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07050230000098"></a>The rule of law also requires that there are prescribed criteria for the scheme, so that this form of justice is administered independently and impartially. That is the bare minimum one would want of any public service, whether it is exercised by government or community-based schemes. That applies even more in the divisive atmosphere from which Northern Ireland is emerging. Obliging the Secretary of State to maintain a public register of accredited schemes would ensure that they operate according to the principles of fairness and transparency required of any body addressing crime, even so-called low level offences.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07050230000099"></a>There must be adequate safeguards against abuse of the procedures. Whether a republican, unionist or any other political interest group is involved and whatever their associations in the past, those principles transcend party and community. They apply now with particular force in Northern Ireland, which has moved from a period of the grave undermining of the rule of law to what we hope will be a healthy democracy, based on the rule of law.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07050230000100"></a>It should not be left to members of the public to complain about lawlessness within the schemes, as suggested by the Minister in previous discussions; lawlessness should be prevented from the outset. The rule of law requires that of all bodies exercising a public function. It is particularly relevant in a society where paramilitaries continue to have an influence. The structures of the rule of law exist precisely to prevent the type of intimidation and coercion that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, has described in previous debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07050230000101"></a>The amendment puts in place a bare minimum of safeguards. We need to look realistically at the practical consequences of omitting these safeguards, which include the undermining of justice, the inculcation of fear and the perpetuation of instability. I submit that community-based restorative justice schemes should complement law enforcement and not turn into alternative and non-accountable systems of justice. Unless the role of such schemes is formalised and their activities subjected to public scrutiny, there is a real risk that community-based restorative justice schemes will undermine the rule of law. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to accept this important amendment.</p>

It seems to me that they have had some success in reducing the incidence of punishment beatings, which we all know have taken place and may still be taking place.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07050230000103"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, mentioned informality. I should have thought that was a good thing when dealing with anti-social behaviour. I also recall that the learned judge from Scotland, who reviewed the whole of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, came down firmly in favour of restorative justice generally. He was also prepared to accept the continued existence of community-based restorative justice. I recall that the Independent Monitoring Commission, of which the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, has been a distinguished member, considered the matter and, on the whole, gave it a clean bill of health. I ask the Government, first, what is supposed to happen if the NIO guidelines are breached, and, secondly, is the amendment really necessary?</p>

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="07050230000104"></a><b><a name="70502-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07050230000711"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, I am a grateful to the noble Lord for bringing back has amendment at this stage. It shows the justification of your Lordship's procedures and that on Third Reading we can make amendments to Bills, having had good debates at each stage.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07050230000105"></a>The noble Lord said that he amended his amendment to meet government policy. That being the case, on behalf of the Government, I am happy to recommend to the House that the amendment be accepted. I agree with every single word of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, I took the reference to informality to be the informality used by the paramilitaries in their &#147;Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, we are in charge and you can't do anything about it&#148; form of formality, which we do not like. This is designed to stamp that out.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07050230000106"></a>We are satisfied with the present protocol. Our present understanding is that it appears to work. There are 16 community-based restorative justice schemes in Northern Ireland; 14 of those are actively in the process of seeking accreditation. There are two minor schemes&#151;minor only in the sense of the number of cases they deal with, which is a handful&#151;and they have not yet expressed interest in seeking accreditation. They have a very low volume of cases.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70502-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07050230000107"></a>We would welcome all such schemes coming forward to seek accreditation. The four Northern Ireland alternatives schemes, as I believe they are known, have expressed an interest in accreditation. The Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice has now inspected each of those schemes and concluded that there are no obstacles to the schemes proceeding to the second stage of accreditation. That has to take place and involves the suitability panel looking at the individual participants. The 10 other community-based restorative justice Ireland schemes have expressed an interest in seeking accreditation and the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice is preparing to inspect each of those. By and large, that is a big step forward from the past situation.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07050230000108"></a>In some ways, I do not make any claims about this&#151;the informality of the protocol and the consultation on it have assisted people to have the confidence to put their feet in the water. Parliament is right to put the principles of the protocol in the provision. That is what the amendment basically contains. There are two &#147;shalls&#148; and two &#147;mays&#148; in the four sub-paragraphs, so it is important that this is not locked down over-rigidly. However, it makes the central point that Parliament wants it to. I have to say in respect of all amendments that have not been drafted by parliamentary counsel, who naturally run the rule over these few words to make sure that the commas are in the right place, that if any textual amendments need to be done in the other place, naturally we will consult with the noble Lord, Lord Trimble.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07050230000109"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Hilton&#146;s question about the breach, schemes that do not meet the protocol&#146;s full requirements will be de-accredited and receive no assistance from the statutory sector. In other words, no money comes from these schemes but, once accredited, they can apply to other bona fide organisations. However, no such organisation would be funding any de-accredited scheme. That is the ultimate sanction.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07050230000110"></a>On that basis, and given that this proposal has received goodwill throughout although it was not added to the Bill, it is another good example of your Lordships&#146; procedures. We have been able to send our goodwill at this stage, with an important process taking place in Northern Ireland, through our unanimous acceptance of this amendment.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that this is a significant step forward to providing a legal underpinning of this provision and trying to do it in such a way that it will not hamper the inspectorate or unduly hamper those who are operating the scheme. I am delighted with this step forward and would like to thank the noble Lord once again.</p>

The amendments were tabled by several noble Lords following discussions between us, and I support them all, including those to which my name has not been added formally on the Marshalled List. I understand that the other amendments in the group will not be moved by the noble Lords who tabled them.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07050230000123"></a>Let me say a few words about the substance of the clause and the associated clauses, which all deal with the release and pre-release of government statistics. They are crucial to the Bill&#146;s purposes and to all matters of integrity and public trust. I know from my years in charge of official statistics that hardly anything is more important than getting these rules right and making them acceptable. Let me explain why both the way in which statistics are published and the pre-release are so important. In passing, I must say how pleased I am that the Financial Secretaryhas announced that publication arrangements&#151;the so-called publication hub, a central office&#151;will be set up to cover all national and, I hope, all official statistics. This is not part of the Bill, but it is a very promising development. I imagine that the details will be settled by the new Statistics Board.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07050230000124"></a>That leaves the key issue of pre-release. That is to say that the key issue is not whether Ministers, advisers and key officials get information about the statistics but whether they get them before publication. If it is felt that they need to get figures ahead of publication, how far ahead should they get them? Obviously, the longer ahead they get them, the greater the danger of leaks and the temptation to cover the statistics with spin of various kinds. This is why it is a sensitive issue.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1075"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1075</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70502-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07050230000125"></a>The way in which the Bill is drafted to deal with this issue is astonishing. Given that these matters are so obviously central to trust and confidence, which is what the Bill is all about, one might have expected it to deal with them positively and helpfully by making them a central responsibility of the new board and central to the code. In fact, almost the opposite emerges. Although the Bill rightly accepts that there must be strict rules and principles on pre-release, these matters are not regarded as a role for the board and it is suggested that they should be dealt with in secondary legislation subject to affirmative resolution. Also, references are made to what are called &#147;appropriate authorities&#148; for dealing with them. In my view, and this is the key point of all the amendments, these are clearly matters for the board and central to the code.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07050230000126"></a>Let me say a word about international comparisons. In many key countries, no pre-release of any kind is allowed. I refer, among others, to Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Poland. In more countries, while some pre-release is allowed, it is limited to one or two hours, or maybe three. Another variant is that, in some countries, pre-release is limited to the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister. It is understandable that special arrangements are made for market-sensitive data, but this country is the odd man out. Market-sensitive data are released to a number of people about40 hours in advance. Many other public statistics are released to Ministers and officials five days in advance. In fact, I believe that I am right in saying that more people have more access to more data further ahead than in any other comparable country.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07050230000127"></a>It is also sadly true that things have slipped a great deal since 2000, when the last reforms were made. Before that, as I know from personal experience, things were tightened up quite a bit. Now they are more lax than anywhere else or than they have ever been before, which I think is harmful not only to the statistical world but also to the Government as a whole. It has been clear throughout the consultation period that this is the issue that is worrying more people than almost any other, so it was good news when the Financial Secretary announced some progress; namely, that non-market-sensitive data that are now available to many people five days ahead will, I believe I am right in saying, be made available only about 40.5 hours ahead. That is a move in the right direction, but not nearly far enough.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07050230000128"></a>What are my conclusions? I can see the point made by the Royal Statistical Society that there should be no pre-release. Although I rather agree with that, I suspect that it would be a move too far. I would like to see an absolute minimum of availability to Ministers and key officials&#151;something of the order of two or three hours ahead, as in so many key countries, and perhaps an even tighter limit for statistics relating to market-sensitive areas.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07050230000129"></a>My main conclusion and thus my main recommendation to noble Lords is not to set a particular number of hours or days, because that would be too detailed. My simple recommendation is that this matter&#151;the decisions, rules and principles on pre-release&#151;should be the job of the new board and central to the new statistics code. That is what these amendments have in  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1076"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1076</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mind. I repeat that this is central to the board and to the new code. It is in the interests of the Government and not just the statistical forces that this should come about. No other single change would send a clearer signal to the public and users than this. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07050230000130"></a><b><a name="70502-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07050230000716"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> The Committee will have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Moser, with huge interest and will respect the enormous experience with which he speaks. I have two amendments in this group. Amendment No. 68 provides that the board must include in the code of practice rules about pre-release in which access is,</p>
<ul><a name="07050230000289"></a>&#147;the minimum necessary to meet the needs of Ministers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000247"></a>That presupposes that the Bill will eventually make sure that the board, and not Ministers, take charge of the arrangements covering pre-release.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07050230000131"></a>Amendment No. 77 deals with the release of statistics generally and gives the board power in the code of practice, which we shall discuss, to include in the rules where the release is to be done, who is to be responsible, and the minimum time gap between release and ministerial or departmental comment on the figures.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07050230000132"></a>I agree profoundly with the noble Lord, Lord Moser. This group of amendments raises perhapsthe most important single issue surrounding the restoration of public trust in the system; namely, the arrangements for the release of statistics and for pre-release access to statistics. The group also exposes starkly what I can only describe as the cynicism of the Government&#146;s present position: that their new Statistics Board, which is intended, in their own words, to distance Ministers from the whole process of statistics, is to be debarred entirely from having anything to do with the pre-release of access to official statistics. Clause 11 of the Bill leaves it to Ministers to make the rules. That is pretty well what happens currently and is what has contributed mightily to the loss of public trust.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07050230000133"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Moser, made clear, there are two separate issues: first, the arrangements for the release of statistics generally; and, secondly, pre-release. First, on release generally, at Second Reading I described what all too often happens. In departments, the same press office that handles the release of the statistics also handles the ministerial statement. That statement often quotes selectively from the full statistics so as to put a spin on the figures. The professional commentary is thus obscured by the ministerial spin, and it is the spin that tends to dictate the headlines. There is really only one way to describe this process: it is corrupt. By that I mean that the process corrupts the clear messages in the statistics as disseminated by the professional statisticians by obscuring or even distorting them with selective political messages intended to steal the headlines. That is the first thing that has to be changed by amending the Bill to outlaw the process. There are two distinct activities&#151;the professional dissemination and the political comment&#151;and they need to be kept quite separate.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07050230000134"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Moser, said, Ministers have some awareness of the problems created by the present process, as can be seen in their reference to  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1077"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1077</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what they have called the hub for the release of statistics. That seems to suggest that there is some process in mind that may go some way to deal with the problems. But we have been told absolutely nothing about how that hub is supposed to work, how it is to operate, who will be in charge, and how it will be policed. More important, will it separate dissemination from comment? It is all very well to say&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Moser, is very generous in his comments about this&#151;that this is a step forward. The noble Lord may know more about it than I do, but I know nothing about how this hub is supposed to work, and I hope that today&#146;s debate will give the Minister an opportunity to tell the Committee more about how it will work and to answer some of my questions. Who will be in charge, how will it be policed and will it separate dissemination from comment?</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07050230000135"></a>The other issue is pre-release. The noble Lord, Lord Moser, has dealt with this, and I hope to do so quite briefly. The board must be given the clear duty to establish the rules and police the practice. As has been said, the United Kingdom is dramatically out of line with international practice with regard to what statistics are subject to pre-release, who has access and the length of time between pre-release and full dissemination. Again, this is an issue that simply must be put right. The board must be put in charge, the rules must be made clear and the Bill must provide for the proper enforcement of those rules.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07050230000136"></a>Naming and shaming will not be enough. Government departments have very thick skins. Those who deliberately flout the board&#146;s rules must be held to account and reported to the parliamentary Select Committee, where perhaps they can be dealt with firmly.</p>

<a name="70502-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07050230000137"></a>I have been told that these proposals have emerged as a result of much argument between the Treasury on the one hand and departmental ministers on the other. I have been told that the Treasury would have likedto have been able to deal with this abuse of thesystem but was defeated by an unholy coalitionof Ministers in other departments determined to cling on to the existing pre-release arrangements. Presumably these people hoped that that would preserve what they see as the political advantage that the current arrangements give them because of the opportunity to interpret the figures as I have described. Do they not realise the grave damage that is done to public trust by that process? Will not the consequence of clinging to the existing policies be simply to prolong or even deepen the public&#146;s mistrust in the system? The Committee must deal with that along the lines so eloquently laid out a few moments ago by the noble Lord, Lord Moser. We should support his Amendment No. 42 and the other relevant amendments that he outlined at the beginning of his speech. This is perhaps the most important issue that we will deal with on the Bill, and we have to get it right.</p>

I agree with the phrase proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin: &#147;the minimum necessary&#148;. That recognises the principle of need.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07050230000139"></a>I have reservations about some aspects of these amendments. One, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, seeks to separate in time the release of the statistics and the release of the ministerial or departmental comment. I see no comment to separate the two in time, because in that lag various things could go wrong. I believe the principle should be separation of channels, which is why I think the &#147;hub&#148; idea, in which the statistics are released in one place in a central hub controlled by the board and the comment comes out of the department&#151;separation in space, so to speak&#151;is the better route to follow.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07050230000140"></a>There is also an amendment from the Liberal Democrat Benches that seeks to give the power to the board, but then seeks to set a maximum time. If they are giving this power to the board, it should have the responsibility for settling matters, and different series of statistics may require different lengths of time.</p>

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="07050230000141"></a><b><a name="70502-0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07050230000718"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Moser and Lord Jenkin, that this group of amendments is probably the most important of all the amendments that we are debating in ensuring that the Statistics Board has the best chance of enhancing public trust in official and national statistics and demonstrating its independence.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07050230000142"></a>As Members of the Committee pointed out, we are dealing here both with release and pre-release aspects of statistics. On the release arrangements, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that it is very good that a hub is promised. &#147;Hub&#148; is an interesting word which can mean a lot of things, and I am absolutely sure that the Minister will explain them when he replies to this group of amendments. I assume that the hub will be based in the Cabinet Office. Given the amendments that we passed last week, that is appropriate. We look forward to hearing from the noble Lord exactly how the hub will work.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07050230000143"></a>Whatever the details of that, I am less worried about it than the issue of pre-release. I think all Members of the Committee agree that the existing arrangements are unacceptable. It is quite extraordinary how far away we are from international best practice in this area. The way in which the Government have sought to argue that having a new norm of 40.5 hours is somehow a huge concession is completely ridiculous. Leaving aside that fact, what is so special about40.5 hours? It gives a spurious accuracy to a huge degree of ministerial discretion. The figure 40.5 gives the impression that there might be a rationale for it, but there is no rationale. If it were 40.75, it might be even better, but 40.5 suggests that there is something hugely significant about this period, which is clearly nonsense.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07050230000144"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, pointed out, we have tabled a number of amendments looking at ways of dealing with this issue. The ones that we wish to support today give the power to decide to the board.  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1079"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1079</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We have also tabled an amendment that would limit the period to two hours, as we were trying to tease out what made best sense. However, we are persuaded that different statistics may have different requirements. Giving the responsibility to the board enhances its power and credibility. Therefore, we do not propose to move the amendment that limits the period to two hours.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07050230000145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moser, set out the amendments that we support. I urge all Members of the Committee to support them too.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="07050230000146"></a><b><a name="70502-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07050230000719"></a>Viscount Goschen:</b> This Bill is about nothing if not enhancing the public&#146;s trust in statistics. I support the principle of pre-release. There are many occasions where government should have informed access to statistics before they hit the markets. However, it is an area where the Government are most open to the charge of manipulating the information if they have too great a head start. Therefore, it should not be solely in the gift of Ministers to determine how much of a head start they have over other interested parties. </p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07050230000147"></a>The Government have gone to the trouble in the Bill of setting up the board and giving it powers. They acknowledge the reduction in public trust in statistics over past years. Therefore, they would miss a trick by insisting on Clause 11, which specifically states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07050230000272"></a>&#147;The Code of Practice for National Statistics under section 10 may not deal with any matter relating to the granting of pre-release access to official statistics&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000248"></a>The board should have a role in this, but perhaps the best compromise is for the board to be able to put forward advice to discuss with Ministers its requirements. Ultimately, the provisions of the code should be confirmed by Parliament through the mechanism of an affirmative resolution.</p>

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="07050230000148"></a><b><a name="70502-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07050230000720"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, our names are added to several of the amendments in this group, and I support what the noble Lord, Lord Moser, said about the core group of Amendments Nos. 42, 57, 57A, 58, 93 and Clause 11 standing part. We also have in this group Amendments Nos. 90 and 92, which we shall not be moving. They propose the publication of the names of the people who were granted access and the terms of the access. We commend that to the Minister as a good idea, whatever happens with this group of amendments, and we hope that he will respond to it.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07050230000149"></a>Amendment No. 42 introduces a function of the board to monitor arrangements for release and pre-release. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that the board will be setting the rules under the amendments via the code of practice, but it also needs to monitor how it will work out in practice and include that in its annual report. Doubtless, the Minister will argue that the Bill does not give the Government the power to set new rules but Parliament will make those decisions by approving a statutory instrument. The Minister will know that we regard that as a mere fig-leaf. The Government will customarily get their statutory instruments through, and they will certainly have control over whether any alterations are made to the rules once they are set by  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1080"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1080</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statutory instrument. It simply does not meet the public interest of ensuring that statistics are free from government spin.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07050230000150"></a>To reiterate points made by my noble friend Lord Jenkin and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, about the hub for statistics, that is a very interesting idea about which we have heard almost nothing in detail. Whatever the Minister says today&#151;and I am sure that we will be grateful if he gives us any further information&#151;we believe that the issue of release should be in the Bill within the power of the Statistics Board, however persuasive the Minister is about the Government&#146;s plans for a new hub.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07050230000151"></a>Finally, I alluded a moment ago to the issue of changing the rules for pre-release. However they are set up initially, they may not work in practice, and we may find that particular Ministers abuse the pre-release access that they are given, or that too many people are given pre-release access. With a statutory instrument, we would be in the hands of the Government to make changes. Clearly, as the most interested party, it is unlikely that they would make changes. The key issue of giving the board control is that the board has the ability to change the arrangements over time if what is initially set up proves not in practice to provide arrangements that form an important part of restoring trust in statistics. The noble Lord, Lord Moser, my noble friend Lord Jenkin and others have referred to the need for those arrangements to play their important part in restoring trust, which is why we firmly believe that the Statistics Board should be in charge of the arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="07050230000152"></a><b><a name="70502-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07050230000721"></a>Lord Chorley:</b> My Lords, at Second Reading, I deliberately said nothing about the pre-release issue for the simple reason that I did not really know anything about it. I had no experience of it, although clearly from the debate it is rather a murky area. At Second Reading, I was struck by the severe criticisms made by the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin of Roding, Lord Turnbull and Lord Moser, among others. All of them were persons of considerable practical experience whose views were important to me. The language used by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, was even rather colourful for an ex-Permanent Secretary. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07050230000273"></a>&#147;Clause 11 ... in effect tells the board to keep its nose out ... leaving Ministers to help themselves to as much time as they want&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/3/07; col. 1484.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000249"></a>I was impressed by the measured way in which the noble Lord, Lord Moser, introduced the series of amendments on pre-release today and perhaps more importantly by the balanced nature of the amendments, which have other names added to them.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07050230000153"></a>After Second Reading, I did not need much convincing that something along the lines of the amendments was clearly needed. Everything that the noble Lord and others have said this afternoon underlines this as being an important flaw in the Bill. I would have no hesitation in supporting the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, said that it was the most important group of amendments to the Bill. Given his great experience, I am sure that we should listen carefully to his view.</p>

It is very important that rules of pre-release be stated clearly so that everybody knows what they are. As far as is possible, pre-release times should be short. However, governments do not gain much advantage from pre-release. Whatever advantage is gained is quickly dissipated partly by incompetence and partly by the fact that clever people can see through any spin that statistics may be given. As I said earlier, when the party opposite was in power and changed the definition of unemployment 22 times, it was quickly seen through. In the case of this Government, the Prime Minister not only pre-released some statistics but got their interpretation wrong. Therefore, I am not much worried about that.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07050230000155"></a>The next question is which agency will state the rules. I do not mind whether it is the board or Minister as long as the first statement of principles and the procedure for revision are not only clear but are placed before Parliament. However, if the board decides to change the rules of pre-release, Parliament should have the right to comment on it or at least to be told about it as soon as possible, because it will not be technical no matter how competent the board is.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07050230000156"></a>As long as those rules are followed&#151;that is, that the pre-release period is short, that a definite agency lays down the rules and that any revision of the rules should be conveyed to Parliament as soon as possible and Parliament is able to comment on it&#151;there is no problem in handling pre-release in a way which best aspires to restore trust in official statistics.</p>

I am also pleased to record a measure of agreement between the Government and all noble Lords who have spoken today. Although some noble Lords indicated that they do not think that the Government are tightening up the system sufficiently within the framework of the Bill, it was conceded that the Bill is about tightening up the arrangements. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked about what he called the extraordinary figure of 40.5 hours. That seeks simply to regulate the most sensitive of all statistics; namely, those relating to the economy and market-sensitive information. The 40.5 hours is not a figment of strange imagination, but merely the calculation of the time taken up by a clear day&#146;s grace between the closure of the markets on one day and the their opening on the next day but one. It derives from a calculation of those hours: one clear day plus the hours before the markets open on the actual release day, and from the time that the markets have closed on the day before. It is not a strange formulation but rationalises a period within which statistics would be released under the pre-release arrangements, against a background of the necessary arrangements for market-sensitive material.</p>

The noble Lord will recognise that it is reasonable that we measure the amount of time for which Ministers should have access to information which they know to be market-sensitive, within the UK framework, against the period which I have indicated.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07050230000160"></a>I also recognise that there is appreciation of the Government&#146;s proposals to address these issues within the framework of a central publication hub. Pressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated that he would like to hear more about it&#151;I shall enlighten the Chamber on government thinking on these changes. I must add that there is consultation on this concept which will relate to the future working of the board. Final development of work in this area will therefore depend on consultation after the chair of the board has been appointed. I therefore cannot be definitive today, but I shall address those questions.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07050230000161"></a>That pre-release is necessary is recognised in this House, in the other place and by the Treasury Select Committee in its July 2006 report. I am grateful that none of the amendments today, although spoken to in typically forthright terms, denies the principle of pre-release, but the movers of the amendments constructively seek to identify how it could be affected. I emphasise the obvious fact that the principle of pre-release is accepted in a large number of advanced countries, with many statistics available to Ministers in the USA, Canada, Spain, France and so on, the day before publication.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07050230000162"></a>Pre-release access provides a fundamental safeguard, enabling the Government to consider and plan contingency or mitigation measures, release further clarifying information which might be needed on the basis of a statistical release, and to guard against disproportionate and potentially costly market reactions and currency movements. Governments are ultimately responsible for maintaining economic and financial stability. Pre-release access to data may be necessary to meet this fundamental responsibility. I therefore make no apologies for the Government having set out to emphasise the statistics pre-release structure in the Bill, thereby attracting a considerable range of ideas on how we could tackle it in a different way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07050230000163"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, gave a perspective on how government policy evolves. He is experienced enough to know that it does not fall out of a hat but is the result of considerable discussion within government, particularly over a policy like this which, as he rightly indicates, is of interest to all departments. There has been considerable discussion but I emphasise that the outcome is that agreed by Cabinet as government policy, which is contained within the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07050230000164"></a>In line with the devolution settlement, we intend that the devolved Administration will set their own pre-release arrangements for national statistics that are wholly devolved. The basic means&#151;and I note the slightly derisive terms in which the noble Baroness,  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1083"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1083</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lady Noakes, referred to the parliamentary process&#151;of putting the process within the framework of secondary legislation guarantees parliamentary scrutiny. I understand that these amendments provide for an alternative approach to the issue, but the Government are fully aware that there is parliamentary interest in how these statistics emerge in the process, and that we are guaranteeing parliamentary control in those terms. We guarantee that where the board, in fulfilling its purposes, gives rise to parliamentary anxiety, there will be a framework within which this can be tackled.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07050230000165"></a>It is not fair to suggest that the Government are shying away from necessary scrutiny of this important part of the arrangements&#151;far from it. We are proposing a real tightening up of the process as compared to current practice where pre-released arrangements agreed by Ministers are contained in a non-statutory protocol; whereas the new arrangements will be subject to full scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07050230000166"></a>We also commit ourselves to establishing a statistical system which can be developed in the light of experience. We will review the whole operation of pre-release after 12 months. If it is the case, as some noble Lords are indicating, that the Bill will not be sufficient to restore and enhance that trust in official statistics&#151;which is the objective of the Government and is shared by all sides of the Chamber&#151;we will revisit these issues in due course.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07050230000167"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Moser, for his identification of the amendments which light the core of his argument on what needs to be changed in the Bill. I will first of all address those amendments, while recognising that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, tabled amendments which also need to be seriously considered.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07050230000168"></a>Under Clause 10, the board will already have the ability,</p>
<ul><a name="07050230000290"></a>&#147;to prepare, adopt and publish a Code of Practice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000250"></a>Under Clause 12, it will have a duty to assess compliance with that code. The Government fully expect the board to include in its code of practice arrangements for the release of statistics. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the board from not only monitoring the arrangements for the release of official statistics, but from determining them in the first place&#151;after all, the main thrusts of the amendments relate to the significance of the board in relation to these issues. The Government would expect the board to do that.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07050230000169"></a>The arrangements for pre-release are different in so far as they may be&#151;and indeed in some cases will be&#151;of special status, agreed by Ministers and approved by Parliament. But even under that provision, Clause 11 states that the pre-release arrangements contained in that order will be considered as part of the code for which the board will have responsibility. We are not therefore devaluing the role of the board with regard to pre-release; we are indicating that the board and its code will have a framework within which it can comment on government practice.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07050230000274"></a>&#147;The Code of Practice for National Statistics undersection 10 may not deal with any matter relating to the granting of pre-release access to official statistics&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000251"></a>I do not think that that is what the Minister said. I think he said completely the reverse and I shall be grateful for his explanation.</p>

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="07050230000171"></a><b><a name="70502-0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07050230000727"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> We are identifying areas for which Ministers will be responsible and on which the board in its code will seek compliance with regard to statistics. If a practice is adopted which the board finds exceptional and of which it is critical, it will, with its code, have the framework for comment. It will be making a report to Parliament in any case and, as we have indicated, the prime responsibility for parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial action lies inthe secondary legislation. The proponents of the amendments suggest that we substitute the board for ministerial action. I indicate that the Bill envisages ministerial action subject to parliamentary scrutiny with regard to secondary legislation and that the board, with its code of compliance, will, if necessary, comment on practices that are operating.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07050230000172"></a>The release practices are set out by the board inthe code. The only part reserved for Ministers is on the pre-release arrangements. We therefore have the board identifying the broad structure and Ministers dealing with certain sections of pre-release. Within that framework, the board is not devalued in its role on official and national statistics. A particular area of pre-release is reserved to Ministers, subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Also within the framework, we expect to see the tightening of arrangements. I have already indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that the 40.5 hours&#146; restriction is significant as regards present arrangements. It codifies the existing system and makes a due response to the view expressed in this Chamber that we need closer control over pre-release and I have indicated the basis on which the timescale is to be adopted.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07050230000173"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, emphasised his anxieties about certain aspects of the process. Within the framework of the Bill, the Government address the main issue the noble Lord raised at Second Reading, when he emphasised the importance of the pre-release issue. It is sought to keep pre-release to a minimum and within the framework proposed by the Government on these matters.</p>

<a name="70502-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07050230000174"></a>Noble Lords raised a number of other points in the debate. The most important was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Moser, and reflected in other speeches, including that of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, which is the concept of the hub. That is also part of the Government's thinking on how we will seek to obtain greater coherence to the pre-release arrangements and guarantee that the structure in this country meets the needs of Ministers with proper responsibility for statistics, and the wider public's concern that this necessary responsibility of Ministers  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1085"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1085</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should not be turned into what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, identified as the possibility of spin by Ministers, which therefore affects the acceptance of statistics when they enter the public domain.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70502-0005.htm"/>


<a name="70502-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07050230000175"></a>The key proposal is that the hub will be the separation of policy commentary from statistical commentary and release. Therefore, it will be clear that what are released are the official statistics with proper analysis of their significance, and then separately the policy commentary, which Governments are bound to have and which the nation is bound to be interested in, in response to salient and significant figures. How will that be done in the framework of the hub? The board has the responsibility for overseeing the hub and agreeing how it will operate. We expect, however, that as an executive function, the National Statistician will oversee the day-to-day operation. Indeed, the Financial Secretary has already announced that a key motivation of the hub is that very separation I identified a few moments ago.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07050230000176"></a>I recognise that the hub does not appear in the legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, would have sharply pointed that out to me had I not acknowledged the fact. Until the board is established the actual operation of the hub cannot be finalised. It will need extensive discussion on how it will work. It impacts on the role of the board and the relationship of the National Statistician and chairman of the board. I emphasise&#151;the Financial Secretary has already made this quite clear&#151;that it should necessarily be a clear separation between the statistics for which the board is responsible and which are issued, and policy commentary from Ministers. The hub concept would develop that.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07050230000177"></a>The board will have a crucial role in overseeing compliance with the new pre-release arrangement. Parliament will oversee the general policy on the secondary legislation. The board will have a statutory duty to assess compliance with the new tighter arrangements that we are putting into place and enforcement of the code of practice. We expect that if these new rules are complied with, the board will take an assessment of those statistics. If the board is critical of the way releases have taken place then it could use sanctions, such as identifying the fact that those statistics do not meet national standards. The board would do so in a public report. It would also appear&#151;this would be serious&#151;in the annual report to Parliament, although it would not wait upon it.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07050230000178"></a>We are emphasising that: first, we have sought to meet the anxieties expressed in the Committee that arrangements should be codified and that the period of pre-release should come down significantly to the limited time that we are proposing of 40.5 hours; secondly, that the board will have responsibility for assessing this process and ensuring compliance with it; and thirdly, that there has to be a distinction between the release of the statistics and the policy commentary on them by Ministers. The Bill is constructed against that background on these pre-release concepts.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07050230000179"></a>It will, I hope, be recognised that the amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Moser, spoke first seek to put responsibility solely with the board. The  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1086"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1086</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government&#146;s strategy is one which will meet with public approval in terms of guaranteeing that the pre-release period is restricted, that there is proper supervision of that process, and that the board has a crucial role in commenting on the way national statistics are used by policy makers. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able therefore to accept the Government&#146;s position and withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="07050230000180"></a><b><a name="70502-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07050230000728"></a>Lord Moser:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his detailed reply to the debate. There were one or two points that I felt uncomfortable about. One was the reference to international acceptance of pre-release; this is true, but not in the sense of international acceptance of the degree of pre-release that we have. In most places it would be regarded as excessive. I said when I introduced the amendment that tightening up to 40.5 hours for non-market-sensitive data is a mini-step in the right direction, but no more than that.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07050230000181"></a>The Minister made very clear that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the board commenting on pre-release arrangements, or monitoring anything to do with statistics. Listening to that took me back to the early days of the route towards this debate when the Chancellor first mentioned what he had in mind. I was one of many in the professional statistical world who welcomed the Chancellor&#146;s initiative, as I still do. I welcome that there is a Bill. I welcome the fact that this is all intended to improve public confidence in official statistics. It is evident to everyone that the lack of public confidence has less to do with the quality of the statistics than with how they are used by Ministers, the media and everyone else. That is the central issue.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07050230000182"></a>Any commentator from the statistical world, either here or abroad, considering the Bill and welcoming this route towards greater confidence would want to know what is proposed about pre-release&#151;the one subject on which this country is so out of line with most others. They would be surprised to find that Clause 11, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has already drawn attention, states that that is nothing to do with the code. It would surprise everyone that the board is evidently not given prime authority.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07050230000183"></a>It is not enough to know that nothing can stop the board from taking a key interest in the area. The amendment provides that governing pre-release&#151;in other words, deciding on pre-release arrangements, which, incidentally, should be uniform across Whitehall&#151;should be a prime responsibility of the board and a prime content of the code. It should be able not just to comment or to monitor; it should be in charge of that central aspect of public trust.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07050230000184"></a>Because that view is still some considerable distance from what the Minister said, I suggest that we test the opinion of the House.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07050230000275"></a> Clause 8, page 4, line 40, at end insert &#147;or</p>
</ul>(d) the way that official statistics have been misinterpreted whether by Ministers, departments, civil servants or otherwise.&#148;
<a name="70502-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07050230000190"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 148. Amendment No. 45 seeks to ensure that the board has a clear power to draw attention to the misinterpretation of official statistics and can notify the Minister and others responsible of offenders. At present, there is no adequate safeguard against misunderstandings or the misuse of statistics. Clause 8(2) deals only with the production of official statistics and not with their dissemination. Even flawlessly accurate statistics can be misrepresented. Almost all statistics can be presented in a manner that is designed to confuse or to present only one side of an argument. Data can be misinterpreted deliberately or accidentally by a government department or respected media source. Either way, the Statistics Board should be the appropriate authority to be given the responsibility for monitoring and highlighting any concerns so that the appropriate steps can be taken to correct the damage and prevent further mistakes from happening in the future. I beg to move.</p>

As we have already heard this afternoon, the creation of public trust is at the centre of the endeavour. Public trust will be better created if there is independent and professional critical analysis of statistics. I would like the amendments to be widened at the next stage to include the positive aspects of critical analysis as well as the negative ones.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07050230000192"></a>We are dealing with a profession whose workings are not widely understood by the public. Therefore, the public will always have a feeling that these matters need to be explained to them by someone whom they  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1090"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1090</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can trust, which means someone who they believe really understands what they are talking about. That means the professionals. It is therefore central to the working of the Act that the board has the role of critical analysis and that it delegates that role to the National Statistician. Indeed, one would hope that, when there is a question of interpretation, a consultative process would be undertaken between the interested parties to consider where the issues lie and to work out who might be in support of what before the dialogue goes into the public domain. The thrust of these amendments is entirely right.</p>

<a name="07050230000193"></a><b><a name="70502-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07050230000731"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b><I></I>I believe that we are also discussing Amendment No. 148, in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and his colleague, and of the noble Lord, Lord Moser. That amendment states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07050230000276"></a>&#147;The National Statistician may comment publicly on statistical matters including correcting misunderstandings or public commentary based on erroneous interpretation of official statistics&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000252"></a>That is a duty that the National Statistician should certainly be encouraged to perform, and it is the duty of the board to back up the National Statistician if, as has happened to previous chief statisticians, they are subject to serious criticism by Ministers. If Ministers quote selectively from statistics and thus distort the full message that those statistics are intended to convey, it must be for the head of the profession, the National Statistician, to point out that that is misleading the public.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07050230000194"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moser, may have views on this, but I can well understand that it would be a brave National Statistician who chooses to take on a senior Minister. Nevertheless, as my noble friend Lord Eccles has just said, if we are going to restore faith, this may need to be done. Further, the knowledge that the National Statistician can say, &#147;Minister, you have actually misled the public with this and we are going to make a statement&#148;, and that he is backed by the board on that, would act as a pretty condign disincentive to Ministers who try to fiddle with statistics. While I have not put my name to the amendment, I regard it as important. It would be the head of the profession who would comment professionally on the misuse of statistics. I hope that, in his reply, the Minister will be able to address himself to that.</p>

In my long experience of dealing with statistics, I know of few which have a single interpretation. I spent a lot of my professional life debating monetarism, and no money number ever commands even partial unanimity, let alone universal unanimity. We have to be very careful. Freedom in these matters is important and, once a number has been released, it is impossible for anyone to declare, &#147;That is a misinterpretation&#148;, because there is no single interpretation. I will not cite examples but, whenever a number is released, if the rate of growth looks good, you talk about that; if the absolute increase looks good, you talk about that; and cycles

In an ideal world, this amendment would not be necessary. One would imagine that the National Statistician, who is responsible for the corpus of statistics&#151;if that is the right collective noun for statistics&#151;would comment publicly if she felt that they were being misinterpreted.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07050230000197"></a>While I take what the noble Lord, Lord Desai, says and agree that many statistics are open to a number of interpretations, I believe that in some cases they are clearly misinterpreted, whichever logical view one might take. The reason for tabling the amendment is to give the National Statistician legal cover so that, if or when she wished to comment on a set of statistics that had been misinterpreted, she would be protected against a barrage from Ministers. If, in responding to the debate, the Minister says that the amendment is completely unnecessary because the Government accept that this would be part of the role of the National Statistician, we would be pleased to hear that. Otherwise, the amendment is important.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, if the Minister can reassure us that the amendment is not necessary and that the National Statistician still has this freedom, even encouragement, to comment on misunderstandings, I should be happy.</p>

<a name="70502-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07050230000199"></a>My second point relates to what I have just said. The Statistics Commission, which has done an increasingly powerful and important job in recent months and years, is to be abolished. When it was first set up a few years ago, I took the opportunity of saying to Ministers that I hoped that its terms of reference could include the power and encouragement to comment on Ministers as well as on statistical officials. However, that was not accepted. This is an important point for the future role of the board.</p>

I shall not accept them&#151;that would be asking a little much&#151;but I shall respond in exactly the terms that the noble Lords, Lord Newby, Lord Jenkin and Lord Moser, suggested. I give assurances that that is exactly how we believe that the situation will obtain after the Bill becomes an Act. Clause 8 guarantees that. It has the added advantage&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Newby, drew attention to this in his amendment&#151;that the National Statistician, provided that his judgment is right and is supported by the board, has that dimension to his representation, too.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07050230000209"></a>We have already discussed resources for the Statistics Board. The Government did not accept our amendments that would have put resources in the hands of a parliamentary commission. That leaves the Government and, of course, the Treasury in charge of resources. The amendments passed last week, which provide that the Cabinet Office, rather than the Treasury, has residual functions, may assist the Statistics Board&#146;s case for resources to be heard in Whitehall, but we know who ultimately controls the purse strings. Whoever sets the level of resources, we believe it important that the board should have a duty to review that resource level and act if it believes that the resources are insufficient. That in turn could generate a debate about the proper level of resources devoted to statistics, which, if the case were well made, could lead to the provision of more resources. There would be no obligation for resources to be provided, but public debate would be encouraged.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07050230000210"></a>We have not yet discussed the resourcing of official statistics prepared outside the board. Problems could easily arise in other departments as a consequence of the resource squeeze that is applied via departmental expenditure limits. Let us take an example. The board could take the view that the crime statistics produced by the Home Office were deficient, but Home Office statisticians could say that the statistics were the best that they could do with the resources that had been made available to them within the Home Office. The  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1093"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1093</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ability of the Statistics Board to report publicly would provide a useful negotiating weapon in getting departments&#151;such as, in my hypothetical example, the Home Office&#151;to ensure that their statistical services were properly resourced. This is not just about making sure that the resources of the Statistics Board are correct; it is about resources right the way across Whitehall.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07050230000211"></a>I am sure that the Treasury will hate this amendment, because it sees itself as the sole arbiter of resource levels in all government departments, but I hope that the Minister will not be bullied by his officials in this case and that he will recognise that there are real issues here. It is clear that statistics have suffered in the past through resource squeezes, and they will almost certainly do so again, quite possibly as a result of the latest budget settlement. The new clause is a modest counterweight against that. I beg to move.</p>

It raises a live issue. It is important that the Statistics Board has adequate resources; if it did, one might question whether an amendment was needed to ensure that it could make a noise if there were a problem.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07050230000213"></a>It is important to remind the Committee of the situation in which the ONS finds itself in light of staffing cuts that have been imposed on it by the Treasury. Within the past few months, it has announced that its annual cross-check on the accuracy of the national annual accounts will not be published in full. To quote the ONS, that will create,</p>
<ul><a name="07050230000291"></a>&#147;some temporary additional uncertainty about the path of the economy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000253"></a>The annual statement of the UK&#146;s balance of payments will,</p>
<ul><a name="07050230000292"></a>&#147;include less analysis than usual&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000254"></a>The Bank of England has also expressed concerns that planned so-called &#147;improvements&#148; to the measurement of the service sector are being delayed. Preparations for the 2011 population census are falling behind, as are plans to collect improved immigration data. The ONS has also admitted that a survey on wealth is behind schedule. This is a terrible state of affairs. The amendment would give the new board the maximum chance and, again, the maximum legal cover to make its case to Parliament if it believes that this kind of cost-cutting is jeopardising its ability to do its job properly.</p>

I would have thought it axiomatic that, if the board is not to be a charade, it must be able not only to monitor resources and the quality of any official statistics but actually to do something about them. If the board is not there for that purpose, it looks right from the start as if it is not being given a reasonable job. That is sending a lad on a man&#146;s errand, as they used to say. I am sure that the Minister can reassure us that it is within the scope of the board to ensure that it has the resources to do the job.</p>

We have already heard that substantial numbers of senior staff concerned with precisely the matters to which the noble Lord referred have proved reluctant to move to south Wales, and that this is hampering the work of the ONS.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07050230000216"></a>To come back to the point of the amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Noakes, I referred in an earlier debate to the European principles on statistics. I do not want to anticipate the amendment that I shall move on that matter, but Principle 3 refers directly to the adequacy of resources. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07050230000282"></a>&#147;The resources available to statistical authorities must be sufficient to meet European statistics requirements&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000255"></a>Then there is a list of indicators:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07050230000283"></a>&#147;Staff, financial, and computing resources, adequate both in magnitude and in quality, are available to meet current European statistics needs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000256"></a>I repeat what I said before; namely, that that includes the statistics needs of individual countries within the European Union. The document continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07050230000284"></a>&#147;The scope, detail and cost of European statistics are commensurate with needs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000257"></a>I shall not read it all now, but the clear international requirement of the convention to which we are party is not only that the resources are sufficient but that they are seen to be sufficient and that there are procedures to ensure that they are sufficient. That is what the convention requires. Therefore, it seems to me that my noble friend&#146;s amendment is entirely justified. I hope that the Minister will be able to give her a reassuring reply.</p>

<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="07050230000217"></a><b><a name="70502-0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07050230000741"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I shall certainly do my best to give the noble Baroness a reassuring reply. We should distinguish between two sets of resources. The resources for the board will comprise a five-year settlement, as we have indicated. Like any other body, it would speak out if it found itself inadequately financed and would identify where new obligations had severely increased costs. We are undertaking a five-year settlement to give the board independence. It will be expected to reach its objectives within that framework of resources.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07050230000218"></a>The other resources to which noble Lords referred concern where the board has identified that a department is falling short in its production of statistics at the appropriate level and quality. It is for the board to draw attention to that, and the National Statistician will take responsibility for doing so. The Minister in charge of the department that produces the statistics will be responsible for meeting such criticism. Those people are accountable for resources and will need to meet any failings identified by the board and to allocate resources accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07050230000219"></a>I hear what my noble friend Lord Lea said about the present position. We shall discuss the issue of relocation on a later amendment. That precedes the setting up of the board and the new financial arrangements that we have indicated we have in mind. I shall comment on the Newport move in due course, but the ONS  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1095"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1095</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already has more senior managers based in Newport than in London. The relocation of senior posts is key to the overall success of the ONS&#146;s strategy for relocating work. That process is under way. We shall debate that later and I shall reserve my position until then.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07050230000220"></a>As regards whether the ONS is able to meet its current obligations, it is embarking on the next stage of modernising the UK national accounts, which will deliver significant long-term benefits. In respect of that, the Blue Book in 2007 will be reduced somewhat in scope to release skilled and experienced staff to carry out the modernisation. The ONS will deliver one significant improvement by incorporating into the national accounts estimates for in-house software development in businesses, which has been a weakness in the past.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07050230000221"></a>Modernisation is going on. I hear what noble Lords say about resources and I accept the obvious point that the board needs resources to carry out its work. It will at times, if the board comments adversely on a range of statistics, be clearly identified that resources will be necessary to be devoted towards improvement. That responsibility is bound to lie with the department or whoever is responsible for such statistics. Within the framework of Clause 8, where the board has to monitor the quality, good practice and comprehensiveness of official statistics, it has the base to achieve what the amendment suggests that it needs to achieve. The powers are there in that clause, and we expect the board and the National Statistician to exercise their powers to reach exactly the objectives identified in the amendment.</p>

There are two separate strands. There is the issue of the board&#146;s resources, on which most noble Lords taking part in the debate on the amendment concentrated. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the board could comment on its own resources; that is at least one bit of reassurance. However, he as usual trotted out the five-year settlement as the answer to all things financial relating to the Statistics Board. We are not convinced that the five-year settlement will prove adequate as it is currently announced. It is not provided for in the Bill, so it applies only to the first five years and does not form part of any argument for the security of the resource levels available to the board.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para9"></a>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="07050230000285"></a> Clause 9, page 5, line 8, at end insert &#147;, taking account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and any other relevant international codes or agreements&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07050230000228"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving AmendmentNo. 52, I will speak also to Amendment No. 60 in the name of my noble friend Lady Noakes, which is grouped with it. Amendment No. 52 would require the board when giving,</p>
<ul><a name="07050230000293"></a>&#147;guidance and advice to persons responsible for official statistics&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000258"></a>to take account of the two main international statements of principles; namely, the European code and the United Nations fundamental principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07050230000229"></a>In Amendment No. 60, my noble friends have exactly the same objective, but they have linked it to the board&#146;s code of practice. The result might be almost exactly the same, but I see some merit in making the requirement explicit and directly binding on the board, which would happen if it comes into Clause 9, but I would not die in a last ditch for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07050230000230"></a>The two primary international codes are the <I>United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics</I>, which were adopted in 1994 by the UN Statistics Commission, which describes itself as,</p>
<ul><a name="07050230000294"></a>&#147;the highest statistical authority in the world&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000259"></a>after lengthy international discussion, and the <I>European Statistics Code of Practice</I>, which was aEU Commission recommendation endorsed by EU economic and finance Ministers in November 2005. The EU code, I am advised, explicitly recognises the UN code and is consistent with it. There are other international statistical agreements and principles&#151;I instance the 1993 System of National Accounts&#151;but all such more specific agreements are consistent with the overarching codes.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07050230000231"></a>My argument for making reference to these well respected international codes in the Bill is that it would leave no doubt in the mind of Parliament, government or the board as to the scope of the ground that is to be regarded as the proper territory of the board. Without such express reference, the board might find itself accused of stepping beyond the remit that Parliament intended or act in fear of such criticism. There is almost nothing in the Bill to indicate the nature of the guidance that the board may give. The two codes give express guidance to the board as to what is legitimately within its remit. That is the purpose of including the reference.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07050230000232"></a>Equally important, reference in the Bill to the international codes will remind the board to make sure its guidance is consistent with international expectations or to consider fully the consequences of offering advice that might be seen to be at odds with the international consensus. That is important in building the international credibility of the UK statistical service. The noble Lord, Lord Moser, has already told the Committee that other countries do not face the same problem of the falling-away of public trust and are puzzled as to why we suffer it. Therefore, it is important that we should be able to

Reference to the two codes is important in that regard.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07050230000233"></a>I shall not go through the international codes in detail&#151;they are lengthy documents&#151;but there is nothing in either of them that need cause anxiety. They are the synthesis of good sense in statistical matters. For instance, Principle 1 of the UN code makes it clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="07050230000295"></a>&#147;official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honor citizens&#146; entitlement to public information&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000260"></a>Some people might think that that is a clearer exposition of what the Bill is about than appears in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07050230000234"></a>Principle 6 of the UN code states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07050230000286"></a>&#147;Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050230000261"></a>That is an international obligation to which this country has subscribed. Individual privacy, which we shall come to discuss, is a matter of concern to many in this Chamber, and it is helpful to have such a clear statement of principle from the UN.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07050230000235"></a>The UN code has stood the test of time&#151;some14 years have gone by without significant amendment&#151;and the EU code, while newer, has been accepted by all the European statistical offices as the basis of a Europe-wide assessment function carried out under the principles of peer review. The UK statistical service is, I am advised, to be reviewed against the EU code this year. It would be wrong for the Statistics Board to do anything other than work in close partnership with the EU arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07050230000236"></a>Amendment No. 52 would expressly import the two conventions into the Bill by requiring that the board take account of those international codes. I beg to move.</p>

As we have also suggested in previous debates, the Government&#146;s general approach, where possible, has been to seek not to over-prescribe in legislation but to leave it to the independent, non-executive majority board, composed of those with a range of expertise and background, to use its own judgment in working out how best to fulfil its statutory duties. As we have indicated in the Explanatory Notes, we fully expect the board to take account of such guidance. However, as I have also said, it is not sensible to place in the Bill a statutory obligation on the board to take account of many of the codes mentioned.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07050230000240"></a>On Amendment No. 60 and the general approach to the development of the code, the Government&#146;s approach was, as in much of this legislation, not to over-specify the requirement on the independent board as to how it fulfils its duty to develop and produce a code. As set out in Clause 10, however, the board is under an obligation in developing or revising the code to consult those it thinks necessary, and we would expect it to take due account of other relevant principles and guidance. The final content is for the board itself to determine.</p>

<a name="70502-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07050230000241"></a>We expect a wide consultative process, taking account of many of the important guidance issues which have been mentioned. We also expect the board to look at the commendable work of the Statistics Commission, which has put out its own proposals on a revised code of practice. Again, however, we do not think it appropriate to place statutory obligations upon them, and I repeat that we should leave what is right to the independent board&#146;s judgment.</p>

I take issue with him on the point that, if the United Nations decided&#151;after the comprehensive consultative process when it first introduced the code&#151;that the code required some amendment or strengthening, it would be inconceivable that the board and the whole of the UK statistical system would not want to come into line. His argument that we should not put it in the Bill because it might be changed therefore seems fanciful. The Minister has rather scraped the barrel with his argument against putting this in the Bill, but I will study what he has said. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Clause 10 requires the board to prepare a code of practice for national statistics. This is the first time in the Bill that we encounter national statistics as opposed to official statistics, which are referred to elsewhere. We support the existence of the code of practice and pay tribute to the work that the Statistics Commission has done in developing the content of a code.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07050239000007"></a>What we do not support is the Government picking and choosing which official statistics are to be assessed against the code, leading to designation as national statistics. We believe that the distinction between official and national statistics is unhelpful and confusing to lay users of statistics, and simply that no official statistics should be prepared without regard to the code of practice. Our amendments are slightly different from those in this group tabled by the Liberal Democrats, as theirs have a distinction between official and national statistics, admittedly on the basis of being within the control of the board rather than the control of government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07050239000008"></a>Amendment No. 54 changes the title of the code to the &#147;Code of Practice for Official Statistics&#148; in Clause 10(l). There will be no separate national statistics in our scheme for this part of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 78, 80, 81, 82, 84 and 85 amend Clause 12 so that it is not for government departments to choose whether to have their statistics assessed against the code. The board will be required to assess all statistics. Amendments Nos. 87, 88 and 89 make consequential amendments to the reassessment provisions of Clause 13. Lastly, Amendment No. 91 converts the obligation of the board to publish a list of national statistics to one which publishes all official statistics together with a note of when they were assessed and the result of that assessment.</p>

Then this division was made between the kosher statistics, if I can call them that, which deserved all the discipline of a code and so forth, and the non-national statistics of a lower league. It is quite unhealthy and, on the whole, meaningless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07050239000011"></a>What is unhealthy about it is that Ministers themselves decide what is to be called national, and therefore subject to strict rules, and non-national, which will not be so subject. For example, when the Secretary of State for Health deals with waiting lists, the quarterly waiting-list statistics are national statistics and monthly waiting-list statistics are non-national statistics. No one could explain to me the justification for that distinction, the monthly statistics not being subject to exactly the same rules. Unauthorised migrant statistics are non-national statistics and at this time only 20 per cent of all official statistics are non-national. It is therefore a minority group, arbitrarily divided from the majority and unhealthy because, as has been said, it causes more suspicion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07050239000012"></a>A simple and, I would have thought, uncontroversial change to the Bill would be to call all statistics official, or national, or government. The simplest way of dealing with the problem, as proposed in the amendment, is allowing the board to decide what to call different kinds of statistics. Above all, it is important that Ministers lose that power. With that in mind, I support the amendment.</p>

However, I want to remind the Committee that lying behind much of this is the report by Professor Adrian Smith on criminal statistics. In that, he poured considerable doubt on the validity of the various series of criminal statistics which are produced by the Home Office. Under the definitions in the Bill, those are official statistics; they are produced not by the ONS, but by the Home Office. In the light of Professor Smith&#146;s comments and criticisms of the handling of that in recent years, I regard it as bizarre that they should be outside the code that the Bill sets up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07050239000014"></a>The Minister owes the Committee a considerable explanation of why the Government think that that is right. If you are going to have a code of practice for statistics, it should apply to all statistics, as my noble friend Lady Noakes and the noble Lord, Lord Moser, said. An unreal distinction is being drawn which once again, I suspect, has been included in the Bill at the behest of the departments which want to keep a tighter control over their own statistics. They do not want the board crawling over them too much and they certainly do not want them to be subject tothe board&#146;s code of practice. Well, who is in charge? This is a Treasury Bill and, surely to goodness, the Treasury should say to the other departments, &#147;Look, we are all in the same game of trying to restore trust. Now, go away. We&#146;re going to have all official statistics under the guidance of the code&#148;. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer is not prepared to say that to his colleagues, Lord help us.</p>

Having heard about the amount of work going on within the present Office for National Statistics in respect of relocation, changing numbers of staff and so forth, I think that it might be the victim of a slow start. The worst thing for public expectation on the effect of the Bill, and the effect on their trust of what will come out of it, will be the board making a slow start. That will also greatly prejudice its independence. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will comment on whether the board will be able to get off to a quick start and hit the ground running.</p>

The more we have looked at the arrangements in the Bill, the more unsatisfactory they appear to be. All statistics start life as official statistics. As new creations, they have a small &#147;o&#148; and a small &#147;s&#148;. If for some reason the Minister wants them to be made big, grown-up national statistics with a capital &#147;N&#148; and a capital &#147;S&#148;, he says to the Statistics Board, &#147;I&#146;d like these statistics to be made bigger, more important statistics&#148;. The board then looks at them. If, for a whole raft of reasons&#151;some of which might be quite sensible under the thought processes that have gone into the Bill, but others might be quite reprehensible&#151;Ministers do not wish their little statistics ever to reach the higher status, they just keep quiet about that and, as the Bill is drafted, the board is unable to do anything about it. That is why we tabled at an early stage a halfway house, proposing that the board should at the very least be able to initiate an assessment of any statistics it chooses, with a view to assessing them against the code and therefore seeing whether they qualify as national statistics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07050239000018"></a>The second unsatisfactory issue in the drafting of the Bill is that if the board assesses the statistics against the code&#151;the Minister having said that he would like some statistics to become national statistics&#151;and they do not meet its requirements, all that will happen is that they return to being little official statistics and everything is all right. Again, that does not seem satisfactory. The proposal in Amendment No. 54 largely gets around that problem, so we support it.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1102"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all statistics start as official statistics and I assure him that we envisage that the board, within its operation, will see the picture changing and statistics becoming of such import, salience and significance that they move from official to national within the operation of the code. Furthermore, we do not look on the code as restrictive. The formal statement of the code is one of practice against which national statistics, or candidate national statistics, will be assessed. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated, we expect the board to promote its code of good practice against all official statistics. However, as a special responsibility and obligation is identified with regard to national statistics, I shall seek to explain why I must resist the amendments.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07050239000021"></a>Why do we make a distinction between official and national statistics? The noble Lord, Lord Moser, asked that excellent question, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who reiterates it now. In a modern statistical system it is most important and practical that the board&#146;s independent audit function covers all the statistics that are most relevant to policy formulation, delivery and accountability. Those statistics are the most valuable to business, academia and a wide range of other users.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07050239000022"></a>Statistics produced and published by the Government differ in importance. Unemployment statistics are important for a wide range of purposes and uses. They are a bit more important than the number of television licences held by a government department. Few would argue that such statistics should all be treated in the same way or have the same status. An active assessment programme will necessarily bring with it resource implications, both in funding the process itself and in placing a compliance burden on those assessed for the code. It is right that we should limit this assessment to the core set of national statistics&#151;the key statistics that government, business and the public rely on for an accurate, up-to-date and comprehensive description of a modern United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07050239000023"></a>Currently, about 1,300 national statistics cover the vast majority of key statistics on health, education and crime. That set of national statistics is already comparable with our international counterparts. That is not an unimportant factor in terms of issues of international comparison.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07050239000024"></a>Most of the key national indicators are already national statistics. Some have suggested that national statistics comprise around 80 per cent of all official statistics. That is not the case. The very broad legal definition of official statistics, which we use in the Bill, means that it is not a straightforward task to quantify the volume of official statistics.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07050239000025"></a>The definition in Clause 9 includes all statistics produced by the Government, their agencies, the devolved Administrations and other Crown bodies. Statistics from other public bodies can also be added to the scope of official statistics. That reflects the Government's desire to ensure a wide coverage and definition of official statistics which is flexible and can capture the wide, evolving and increasing rangeof data produced and used by government. The volume and range is vast and covers all sorts of information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07050239000026"></a>The Government have adopted this broad definition, as set out in the Bill, to ensure that the vast range of statistical information produced across government is within the scope of the board's objective. The board is required to promote and safeguard its quality, comprehensiveness and good practice. We believe that we should remain committed to the principle that it is right within the vast category of official statistics that the board&#146;s assessment process starts by focusing on those key national statistics on which we all rely, and which, as the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, said, will enable the board to hit the ground running.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07050239000027"></a>The Bill creates a framework that can evolve in the light of experience and changing demands from data users. It means that inevitably the set of national statistics will evolve. There will be a strong incentive for Ministers to look actively at submitting additional departmental statistics for approval as national statistics where they are central to the policy functions they carry out or to the delivery of programmes for which they are responsible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07050239000028"></a>As my honourable friend the Financial Secretary said many times in the other place in its considerations during the passage of the Bill, we also expect the board, as part of its statutory duty, to comment on the comprehensiveness and coverage of official statistics and to comment on any official statistics if it thinks they should become national statistics. That is the process of evolution to which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, drew attention.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07050239000029"></a>I treat with the greatest respect the position indicated by the noble Lord, Lord Moser, when he suggested that it is difficult to draw the line&#151;as inevitably it is, although we are indicating that the line is an evolving line, to which official statistics get translated into national statistics once a case has been made out for them. Also, he sees no need for such a division. There are implications for resource allocation when the board is doing its job properly and makes comments on departmental work and the adequacy of statistics. There will be resource implications if departments have to respond in order to guarantee that they meet the board&#146;s requirement, wherever it occurs, that certain statistics should be brought up to standard. The board should primarily be concerned with the national statistics central to the development of policy formulation in the country.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07050239000030"></a>Obvious criticisms could be made of any division in these terms, but I ask the Chamber to recognise that we must have some regard to the priorities for the board and its work across the massive range of official statistics which exist. Any line drawn is bound to raise the kind of challenges that the noble Lord, Lord Moser, expressed so forcefully in his contribution, but we are indicating that we are devolving to the board considerable responsibilities and very important powers. The role of the National Statistician is greatly enhanced against the background of the rest of the Bill in terms of how the system works. Within that framework I defend what the Bill already says about the definition of national and official statistics. I recognise the valid

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="07050243000001"></a><b><a name="70502-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07050243000040"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I am not sure that we can discern wisdom in the Government&#146;s position. I start by thanking all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. They have highlighted the practical areas where illogical distinctions exist at present. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, put the matter rather well when he said that there would be big statistics and little statistics, and that it would be the Government who determined which escape having to comply with the code and thereby become big statistics. The Minister said that it was valuable to have this distinction, but I did not hear him say anything that made it at all valuable to have the distinction between national and official statistics. The Minister made much about the resource implications, not only for the board but also for those needing to comply with the code. I do not think we would have any problem with that.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07050243000002"></a>The key issue is who should decide the priorities and therefore who should decide what is to be assessed against the code of practice. The Minister's argument is that the Government, through the devolved administrations and government departments, should decide whether or not they want their statistics judged under the terms of the Bill against the code of practice and thereby become big statistics&#151;national statistics. We have argued that it should be for the board to determine that. The board will determine what it does in the light of the resources available to it. It does not have infinite resources and therefore will have to set its priorities.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07050243000003"></a>The Minister argued, in effect, that departments that do not put enough resources into their statistics should be allowed to carry on putting out ropey statistics. That simply does not stack up. There is a large difference between us on whether it is the Government or the board that calls the shots. The board is being set up to restore trust in official statistics. We do not think that trust will be achieved in the way that the Government have described. We would like to think carefully about what the Minister said but it is fair to put him on notice that it is likely that we will be returning to this on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The amendment inserts additional words at the end of Clause 10(1) so that the code of practice required by Clause 10 must be issued within 12 months of the board being established. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the work of restoring trust in our official statistics must begin as soon as possible. In the absence of a code of practice there may be some degree of statistical mayhem, as the Government have the opportunity to manipulate statistics and their release.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07050243000007"></a>We strongly support the statutory code of practice, but our concern is to ensure that it is available as soon as possible. We know that the Statistics Commission has done good work with its draft code, but it is by no means certain that a new statistics board would pick up that work. We do not know if the Government will use their appointment rights to secure some continuity with the Statistics Commission or will try to make a clean break from a body which they have sometimes found troublesome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07050243000008"></a>If there is a clean break ,there is a possibility that the code will be delayed. The code should be operational within weeks of the new arrangements coming into effect. However, we have allowed 12 months, to allow some leeway, from the time that the Statistics Board is established. I hope that the Government will share our desire that the code should get out and be available early in the life of the Statistics Board. I hope that the Minister will set out how and when the Government expect the new code to be issued. I beg to move.</p>

He wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07050243000036"></a>&#147;Although the new Board is unlikely to be in a position to take decisions on the Code until late in 2007 or early 2008, we are seeking comments at this time so as to be able to deliver well-considered public advice in summer 2007&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07050243000033"></a>He goes on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="07050243000037"></a>&#147;All the comments we receive will be provided in full to the new Board, along with an updated text of our proposals&#148;.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07050243000010"></a>It is clear that the commission has regarded this as an exercise which has to be taken at a measured pace. It is right that it is consulting on the December draft, but it does not believe that the new board likely to be able to take decisions until early next year&#151;2008. If the code is going to play the important role which the Government have earmarked for it, it is really important, as my noble friend has said, that it should be operative at the earliest possible opportunity. That timetable, which is already long drawn out, should not be delayed more than conceivably necessary.</p>

<a name="70502-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07050243000011"></a>An amendment along the lines of that proposed by my noble friend seems highly desirable. We all support the idea of the code. No doubt, when the commission has considered all the representations we shall have another draft to consider but we must get on with it. Otherwise, we are going to have a long delay and we do not want that. In the words of my noble friend Lord Eccles, we will not hit the ground running.</p>

By the same token, the code is of such importance that the board should get it right. The Government are conscious of the necessity for urgency.

We are taking steps to ensure that the code is developed as rapidly as possible. It will also be recognised, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated when he talked about the present consultation from the commission, that this is a challenging task. As the code is the fundamental building block of the board&#146;s work, it is essential that it is constructed and in place properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07050243000021"></a>Amendment No. 56 amends Clause 10(1) to ensure that the board both prepares the code and monitors compliance, leading to compliance being specifically included in the board's annual report, as set out in Amendment No. 115. Although Clause 12 deals with the assessment of individual statistics against the code, there is nothing in the Bill that mandates the board to oversee compliance. There may be generic issues about compliance as well as specific ones related to particular statistics or statistical series. The duty to monitor compliance complements the assessment provisions in Clause 12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07050243000022"></a>Amendments Nos. 56 and 115 shift the public emphasis to compliance with the code, but the real meat is found in Amendment No. 65, which would add a new clause after Clause 10 requiring compliance with the code. The new clause requires compliance by the board, the National Statistician, government departments, the devolved Administrations and anyone else who produces or publishes official statistics. It is important that that obligation applies not just to statistical staff who produce statistics but to government departments and their Ministers.</p>

<a name="70502-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07050243000023"></a>That would make it easier for professionals to adhere to the standards that I am sure that they want to attain, because it will be in statute that compliance is obligatory. The amendment also requires consultation with the board on matters of interpretation. I do not understand why the Bill does not emphasise and require compliance. I beg to move.</p>

Our Amendment No. 64 is in the group. If the earlier amendment about the difference between official and national statistics were carried, our amendment would need amending, but it makes two points. The first is of lesser importance, because it is highly unlikely to arise often. If a department feels that it cannot comply with every aspect of the code for some reason&#151;I do not know what it might be, but in theory that is possible&#151;it should consult the board and the board will be required todeem whether that deviation from the code was acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07050243000025"></a>The second point, which would be a valuable addition, is that the amendment places a requirement on departments continually to monitor their compliance with the code and, where they find that theyhave breached the code, to report that breach to the board. At the moment, the board must assess whether departments have complied with the code, but where a department has for some reason not compliedwith the code and discovered that, it should have a statutory responsibility to report that breach to the board.</p>

I have emphasised before, but I take this opportunity to emphasise again, that the Government do not believe in over-prescribing in the Bill the requirements on the board, especially when, in respect of Amendment No. 56, the Bill already provides for the board to be responsible for monitoring.

Of course the board, working with all the relevant stakeholders, will develop mechanisms to engage on interpretation of the code and reporting breaches of it, but that is not a matter for legislation. The approach to reporting breaches may well be set out in the code itself&#151;for which, after all, the board will be responsible. The board may choose to continue with something akin to the current requirement that any accidental or wrongful release of statistics must be immediately reported to the National Statistician. If a suspected breach is brought to the board's attention, or if for any reason it becomes concerned about a possible breach, it can carry out an immediate assessment. The board must publicly report its findings. That is all within the framework of the Bill and I do not think that the amendment adds a great deal.</p>

I am asking for it to be respected that we are allowing the board to judge the code that it will produce for its operation, rather than writing into the Bill, as the amendments do, how the board should act. We expect the code of practice to be a model of good practice for official statistics and for the board to promote it as such.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07050243000030"></a>We had the discussion on a previous amendment about official versus national statistics but all along I have sought to emphasise that the board has responsibility for official statistics. It will seek to bring some statistics within the framework of national statistics when that is merited. The role of the board is to promote the concepts and requirements of the code to cover all statistics. We should not tell the board in detail how to do its job, which is the main thrust behind the amendments. I recognise that they are well intended, because they are directed at objectives for which the board must surely see an obligation. We were earlier asked to ensure that the board moves with dispatch to take responsibility for the operation of its code. I sought to give assurances on that. That does not mean that we would aid the process by being overly prescriptive in legislation, which reduces the flexibility of theboard and, potentially, its competence to get its work done.</p>

He sought to deal with the first amendment in the group, which concerns whether the board should monitor compliance. I do not think that he addressed at all whether departments and others who prepare, produce or publish statistics should comply with the code. That is the meat of this group, as I explained in my introductory remarks. Will he comment on that?</p>

The ultimate sanction of the board is obvious enough: it would include in its annual report presented to Parliament any criticism that it had voiced about national statistics produced by anyone. Within that framework, in ensuring compliance with the code of practice for national statistics, the board has clearly both the powers and the obligations under the Bill. We should leave the board to develop the code of practice against those obvious expectations.</p>

In consultation with and working with all the relevant stakeholders, the board is to develop the mechanisms for engaging on the interpretation of the code and reporting breaches of it. Of course, behind all that lies the obligation of the board to report to Parliament. If, within that report, it identifies a breach of the code by any official, it would put that in its national statistics. Under Clause 13, the board can reassess the national statistic if it believes that there has been a breach; it can indicate that it is dissatisfied with the quality of the national statistic and it has important sanctions for guaranteeing that its judgment is respected.</p>

Nothing in the Bill gives it any power to

They will refer to this debate and say that the Minister expressly refused to allow there to be any provision, on the excuse that he does not want to tell the board what to do.

I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Of course, he is right to say that it is the people who produce the statistics against whom the comments are made, but the board can comment on the fact that a standard has not been achieved on a national statistic. In such circumstances, we would expect the board to work with those involved in a breach to effect change. That would occur and there would be improvement. I was merely indicating that the board has the power to report such a development if it thinks it necessary. That is a very significant sanction. All those working on the production of national statistics will know that, if they are in breach of the code, that sanction might be deployed against them. That underpins the Bill, in relation to the code and its significance, and we do not need to be prescriptive about the work of the board in line with these amendments.</p>

To take the most obvious example in recent years, we are all aware that the absence of statistics on the number of illegal immigrants in the country has raised the political debate to an intensive level, thereby occasioning Ministers to indicate that weaknesses in such areas should be repaired. The noble Viscount will recognise that that is meant to relate to high levels of policy, to such statistics and certainly to national ones.</p>

Why is the Treasury, one of the most prolific producers of official statistics,not included? This clause gives the unfortunate impression that the Treasury will be in such control of the board and have such a close hand in drawing up the code that it will not be necessary to consult it.

For the reason given by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, it seems perverse that Scottish, Welsh and Irish Ministers would be consulted but not the main body of government. It might seem slightly surprising that we are suggesting an additional area on which the Treasury&#151;in this case, the Cabinet Office&#151;should be consulted, as we have been keen to reduce its influence, but, as I said, it seems perverse not to do so in this case.</p>

The particular constitutional status of the devolved Administrations and devolved statistics makes it appropriate that we specify that those Administrations should be consulted on matters such as the code and the appointment of one member to the board.</p>

<a name="70502-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07050255000019"></a>Under the devolution settlement, devolved Administrations have responsibility for devolved matters and related statistics. By joining this legislation, they agreed that the board should have jurisdiction over devolved, as well as reserved, statistics. Given their constitutional responsibilities for devolved statistics, it is right that the legislation should explicitly specify that they should be consulted on matters such as the code or the appointment of one member.</p>

As I think has been suggested, it would be unthinkable for the board not to consult the Treasury and the Cabinet Office, as well as other government departments. That is why the devolved Administrations, but not government departments, appear in the Bill. It is in line with a theme that has emerged this afternoon&#151;that we do not wish to over-specify to the independent board how it should fulfil its duty in developing and producing the code, other than in relation to its responsibility to the devolved Administrations.</p>

In our discussion on the previous amendment, the Minister said that it was for the board to decide how the code might address breaches. The board might put in the code that a department had to report a breach to it. Suppose a department has a Minister whom the board feels has sought to undermine the integrity of statistics for political purposes. The board decides to strengthen the reporting requirements against that Minister and is in any case fed up with Ministers behaving in that way, so it thinks, &#147;Right, we are going to change it and we are not going to consult on it. I have to consult the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish, but they are behaving perfectly adequately, so we do not mind doing that, but we do not have to consult the Treasury, the Cabinet Office or the Home Office, so we are not going to bother&#148;. In a way, that suits my purpose, but I am surprised that the Government feel that that is an acceptable way to proceed.</p>

Notwithstanding that, I would welcome clarification from the Minister. It will come as no surprise that I believe that the matter should be covered, not least because, as I indicated previously, the Bill envisages granting the Statistics Board access to broad swatches of administrative data that will qualify as sensitive and/or personal under the Data Protection Act.

The commissioner drew attention to the fact that he does not at present have sufficient powers to protect the way in which information is shared and disclosed.

However, as I have said previously, we do not intend to stipulate specific organisations on the face of the legislation. At the risk of repeating myself, we think it best to leave it to the independent board, which is composed of those with a range of expertise and backgrounds to ensure that it conducts an effective consultation on the code.

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07050255000063"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment would open up some of the areas of obscurity covering the methods of calculating the retail prices index. The honourable John Healey laid out in Committee in another place the circumstances that justify the Chancellor continuing to have a veto over the changes to the calculation of the retail prices index. He explained that, given the right of holders of these gilts to sell them back to the Government at face value, if the RPI is to be changed to the holders&#146; material detriment, the potentially huge cost to the taxpayer makes it essential that there is provision for such a change to be prevented.</p>

<a name="70502-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07050255000064"></a>The amendment is not intended to reduce the Chancellor&#146;s role, but if the Bill is to restore public trust in the production of statistics and the accuracy of the figures, it must above all be transparent. Even if there is a reason for the Executive&#146;s continuing involvement in the methods used for calculating the RPI, the Government should ensure that it is obvious that there is complete transparency at every stage. As mentioned in another place, it was a lack of transparency and an unclear division of responsibility that led to the confusion and suspicion over the February 2004 changes incorporating hedonic regression methods, even though there was no evidence of political partiality. Although the Bill clearly improves matters, the amendment would go a little further and would be that much more useful for addressing public fears. I beg to move.</p>

It is a hugely complex concept that can affect the measurement of both the retail prices index and the consumer prices index, and I should think that it is one of those things that very few people, apart from the noble Lord, Lord Moser, and others who are and have been deeply involved in statistics, understand anything about. I must say that, despite the evidence that the Library was able to give me, I am still not much the wiser. However, I accept and reinforce the point that my noble friend Lord Howard of Rising has made that, if the Chancellor is going to withhold consent from a change that the board feel is necessary to measure the RPI, that should be transparent and should therefore be reported. I hope that the Government will see the sense of that and be able to accept the amendment.</p>

There were frequent changes as new products came on the market&#151;there were changes certainly every few meetings&#151;and I do not recall the Treasury vetoing any of them. But what did happen&#151;it was a memorable moment&#151;was that when the RPI Advisory Committee had a debate about housing costs, we made a decision that mortgage interest rates should be retained within the RPI. The Treasury did not so much reject the advice&#151;it was not in a position to do so&#151;but decided to go in the direction of RPI minus X and sell that to the City of London. Will my noble friend take account of that variation on the theme? The down side is that it has led to a proliferation of indices. When we take the international dimension into account, there are now three indices when one counts RPI minus X, and the CPI, which is used internationally. I am a bit doubtful about whether the position is as simple as the Bill or the amendment imply.</p>

It was an attempt to explain how the price of an automobile changes in terms of its various characteristics&#151;its top speed, comfort and so forth&#151;because there was no other way of explaining why the price of a car changes. It was agreed that it must be because the various components are valued differently by different people.

To be honest, I found the arguments put by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, rather difficult to follow. If the independent Statistics Board wants to change the basis of the RPI&#151;changes are made from time to time&#151;and if the Chancellor of the Exchequer prevents it doing so, that is a very material and public thing to know and is not something that affects only the holders of index-linked gilts. Given that there is an obligation to raise pensions by 2.5 per cent a year and similarly to increase public sector pensions, it would affect virtually every pensioner in the country. At the very least, the pensions of millions of people would be affected. I would have thought it a matter of perfectly legitimate public concern to know if the Chancellor of the Exchequer wants to stop the independent Statistics Board doing this.</p>

The intention behind this provision is to deal with a highly specific circumstance, one that can be justified on the basis that it relates to the UK debt market and certain holdings of gilts. The holders have the right to redeem their gilts if the RPI changes in certain circumstances. If it did so when these gilts were below par, the implications for the nation&#146;s finances would be very considerable. We are talking about significant sums of money which relate to what are fortunately time-limited gilts, so I can say that this applies only to the year 2030 so far as this provision is concerned. However, we are reflecting here a highly sensitive change in the RPI which would trigger certain market consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07050255000072"></a>What is being sought, therefore, is that the consent of the Chancellor would be required only under these narrow and specifically defined circumstances. It will be required when the Bank has determined that the proposed changes to the RPI are likely to triggerthe clause in relation to gilt-edged securities. Should  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bank determine that the change is not both fundamental and materially detrimental to the holders of index-linked gilts, the Chancellor will play no part in the proposed change. It is very restricted and is set against the background of the nation&#146;s financial needs&#151;not just potential costs on the financial markets, but real fiscal costs because it is likely that the new gilts would need to be issued at higher yields if those they were replacing were redeemed at high yields. That could lead to substantial additional fiscal costs.</p>

<a name="70502-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07050255000073"></a>We do not expect the Chancellor&#146;s role to be triggered very often. Since 1997, the Bank of England has not assessed any of the changes as being both fundamental and materially detrimental to the holders of the relevant index-linked gilts. Accordingly, if this provision had been in place over the past decade, the Chancellor&#146;s role under this clause would never have been activated. While of course I respect the well motivated representations on transparency and openness made by noble Lords, as well as a certain anxiety about the role of the Chancellor in this sensitive area, I assure them that this provision is narrowly defined, highly specific and in the national interest. That is why we have included it in the Bill.</p>

But it would be much worse not to make changes, and I include in that negative changes in the form of preventing an element going into the RPI because it suited the Government not to include it. That would be considerably worse than any damage that could be caused by announcing them. Not announcing changes would be much worse because markets are quite capable of working these things out. Markets are extremely sophisticated. They can work out the elements which go into the RPI&#151;the changes that may or may not be necessary.

I think that the noble Lord accepts that there is necessary adaptation in some of the statistics which are provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07050257000008"></a>Amendment No. 105, a probing amendment,seeks to prohibit the board from &#147;adapting and developing&#148; data under this function. However, in the course of carrying out statistical services, the board may be required to adapt or develop, and not just collect, data. Adapting of data is a significant part of any useful data-processing service the board is likely to provide and as such this should be retained.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07050257000009"></a>At present, for example, the DTI undertakes surveys on construction, selecting businesses from its register of construction businesses as the sample frame. The DTI passes this list of businesses to ONS, where ONS adapts these data using information in its own business registers. For example, the ONS would add records of new construction businesses discovered through its own surveys of business or would inform the DTI that a business on the DTI&#146;s register is no longer trading in construction. The adapted data are returned to the DTI, thereby keeping its construction register in step with the main ONS business register. A service level agreement governs this service and a fee is charged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07050257000010"></a>Given that such work is currently undertaken by the ONS, we think it appropriate that the clause makes it explicit that one example of statistical services that may be provided by the board is in adapting and developing data. This will not allow the board to become simply a conduit of information across government through Clause 44 as it is clear from Clause 44(9) that the regulation may be made only where disclosure is required by the board to carry out its function; and, furthermore, when disclosure is in the public interest. I hope that the noble Earl is satisfied with the explanation I have given.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07050257000017"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this Question was first tabled by the learned Lord Ackner, who was a brave and consistent champion of the cause of justice in this House. When he died a year ago, I tabled it in my own name to draw attention to the Government&#146;s regressive policy on civil justice costs. Alas, I cannot match Lord Ackner's sarcastic wit or his legal authority. He might have recalled the Irish judge,Sir James Matthew, who said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="07050257000042"></a>&#147;In England, justice is open to all&#151;like the Ritz hotel&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70502-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07050257000018"></a>The debate is timely. The Government&#146;s botched plan to create a Ministry of Justice has given rise to well founded concerns on these Benches and within the senior judiciary about its financial, constitutional and management implications. As Lord Justice Thomas told the Constitution Committee yesterday, more safeguards are needed to ensure that the courts are properly funded and administered.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07050257000019"></a>The current DCA consultation on civil court fees provides a sharp focus for this debate. The Civil Justice Council has repeatedly criticised the Government&#146;s policy in this area. It has pointed out that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="07050257000043"></a>&#147;Constant increases in court fees seriously threaten access to justice for those on low or modest incomes who do not qualify for fee exemption or remission, or for legal aid. This should not be seen as simply a book balancing exercise, but is a serious access to justice issue&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050257000036"></a>In response to the last consultation in 2004, the council explained that the policy of full costs recovery is,</p>
<ul><a name="07050257000046"></a>&#147;fundamentally at odds with the aim of securing access to justice&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70502-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07050257000020"></a>The right of access to justice is a fundamental constitutional right. Section 92 of the CourtsAct 2003 empowers the Lord Chancellor to prescribe civil court fees, with the consent of the Treasury. In doing so, it requires the Lord Chancellor to,</p>
<ul><a name="07050257000047"></a>&#147;have regard to the principle that access to the courts must not be denied&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050257000037"></a>But that is too limited a safeguard and must be read and given effect in accordance with the broader common law and convention right of access to justice. </p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07050257000021"></a>What is objectionable is not the principle of levying reasonable court fees. The objection is to a levy that is disproportionate and which impairs the effective enjoyment of the right of access to civil justice. The DCA&#146;s consultation paper was made in the Treasury and written by government accountants, using the language of the marketplace. In today&#146;s Whitehall, the citizen becomes a &#147;customer&#148;, as though the litigant or &#147;stakeholder&#148; was merely seeking to buy butter or go to the cinema. The Civil Justice Council is rightly concerned at the short time allowed for the current consultation and that the consultation is too limited.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07050257000022"></a>As in 2004, the consultation paper takes it as axiomatic&#151;which I think means beyond dispute or argument&#151;first, that the civil courts will continue to charge fees for the entire cost of running the civil and family courts, because a free service would require the newborn justice ministry&#146;s expenditure to be increased by some &#163;400 million; and, secondly, that general government fees and charging policy will continue to apply. It explains that this means that,</p>
<ul><a name="07050257000048"></a>&#147;all services must have a financial objective agreed with the Treasury. The norm is full-cost recovery. But different objectives  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1122"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may be agreed where there is a wider policy justification. Fee remissions and exemptions (Remex) are an example of such a &#145;social subsidy&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70502-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07050257000023"></a>It is characteristic of the Treasury&#146;s market-driven mind-set that it regards fee remissions and exemptions as a social subsidy, given by way of concession. It is a subsidy only in the sense that the taxpayer rather than the court user pays. The paper explains that the calculation of full-cost on which fees are based,</p>
<ul><a name="07050257000049"></a>&#147;takes account ... of all resources needed to run the system. This includes the salaries of relevant HMCS staff and judiciary, general administrative costs including the cost of supporting IT systems, accommodation and an appropriate share of other HMCS overheads. It also includes the cost consequences of previous capital investment&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70502-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07050257000024"></a>Court fees are worth about &#163;550 million and cover nearly 88 per cent of the full cost of running the civil and family courts. Currently, family court fees and magistrates&#146; courts civil fees do not meet the full cost of fee exemptions and remissions. The DCA therefore proposes to increase fees accordingly. It explains that otherwise, to comply with the Treasury fees and charges guide, it would have to reduce spending, for example,</p>
<ul><a name="07050257000050"></a>&#147;by closing courts or reducing staff numbers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050257000038"></a>That is a measure of the priorities of the Treasury in forcing the DCA to choose between closing courts and requiring suitors to pay for the full cost of running them, of paying judicial pensions, accommodating judges in heritage buildings and Victorian lodgings, court modernisation, and the burgeoning costs of investment in new technology.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07050257000025"></a>It is as inappropriate to charge the user for the entirety of these costs as it is to charge the patient for the costs of running the NHS. The core services of the state, whether policing, healthcare, the prison and immigration service, or the courts service should be mainly funded from general taxation. In the words of the Civil Justice Council, the policy,</p>
<ul><a name="07050257000051"></a>&#147;fails to recognise the significant element of collective benefit in the administration of ... justice&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70502-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07050257000026"></a>We are told in the DCA paper that,</p>
<ul><a name="07050257000052"></a>&#147;the requirement to fund most of the business from users&#146; fees creates a strong onus to maximise efficiency&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050257000039"></a>I hope that the Minister will explain to whose efficiency this refers and how a policy of charging users rather than taxpayers will create a strong onus on the part of the DCA and related public authorities to maximise efficiency. I should have thought the reverse to be the case. Why is it is fair and equitable for a claimant of moderate means to be required to pay court fees so as to &#147;subsidise&#148; the cost of judicial pensions and salaries, and maintain the judges&#146; lodgings and heritage buildings?</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07050257000027"></a>I have given notice to the DCA of four key questions that will, I hope, be answered in the Minister&#146;s reply. First, as a matter of principle, is it in the interests of justice to charge those seeking access to the courts the entire cost of running the courts, or, except for commercial and similar cases, should most of those costs be borne by general taxation in funding the courts service? Secondly, what has been the practical impact of the charging policy and its effect in impairing the effective enjoyment of the right of access to courts, especially taking into account the chilling effect of the costs  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1123"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rules, the impact of changes in civil legal aid and the decline in litigation? Thirdly, is the charging policy indirectly discriminatory in its adverse impact on vulnerable groups? Fourthly, would the Government&#146;s proposals to modify the charging scheme be sufficient to avoid arbitrary, discriminatory and unnecessary financial barriers impeding or deterring effective access to justice in civil cases?</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07050257000028"></a>Significant levels of court fees risk deterring the citizen from using the civil justice system. Socially excluded groups are particularly vulnerable. The consultation paper fails to explain how it is objectively justifiable to maintain a policy that has a disproportionate adverse impact on vulnerable groups. Three years ago the Civil Justice Council called for a fundamental review of the exemption and remission provisions. That recommendation has not been accepted. Regrettably, it may once again be left to the courts to conduct a judicial review to secure an adequate guarantee of access to justice.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07050257000029"></a>I said that the debate was timely, but of course it is untimely, coming on the eve of the local government elections, which I fear explains why the Chamber is not crowded. Finally, I should say that I wrote to the Lord Chancellor urging him to reply to this debate since it concerns the DCA&#146;s consultation on a matter of constitutional importance, particularly affecting England and Wales. I have great respect for the Scottish legal system and for its law officers, including the Scottish Advocate-General. But I have to say that I find it a great curiosity that it should be left to the Scottish Advocate-General to have responsibility for replying to this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07050257000031"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, I, too, am curious as to what prompted the Government to invite the Advocate-General to respond to this debate, bearing in mind the responsibilities that I understand he has. By saying that, I do not wish in any way to say that I am not delighted to see him on those Benches.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07050257000032"></a>As usual, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has made a number of apposite observations and posed some demanding questions to the Government. I am simply going to continue in his slipstream. First, I want to ask the Government about the &#163;34 million surplus that was a consequence of the recovery of charges levied on users of the civil courts by the Courts Service in the year ending 31 March 2006. This was the subject of a Written Question by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, which received a Written Answer on Tuesday, 9 January 2007. I hope your Lordships will forgive me if I read out the Answer from the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland. It is plain from her Answer that she accepts that it is undesirable that the system should generate a surplus.</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="07050257000044"></a>&#147;The Treasury has agreed that the over-recovery of&#163;34 million can be phased out over the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 period. Therefore, Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1124"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposes to use the increased income generated to fund: progressive reductions in the civil over-recovery; the additional cost of the proposed reforms in the remission and exemption policy; and any planned increases in resource spending on IT modernisation. Within civil proceedings, we are proposing to introduce hearing fees in the High Court and county court and other changes so that fees better match cost drivers. We are also proposing to make the appropriate reductions to offset extra income from hearing fees and to eliminate the over-recovery. This would be targeted on issue fees and weighted towards the fees for using e-channels (County Court Bulk Centre, Money Claim OnLine and Possession Claim OnLine), reflecting the lower cost compared with paper issue and the objective of promoting their greater use as part of the Her Majesty's Courts Service&#146;s business strategy&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/1/07; cols. <I>WA 67-68</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050257000040"></a>Quite frankly, I have some difficulty in understanding exactly what the noble Baroness means. Will the Minister be kind enough to interpret this Answer in a way that makes it clear what measures will contribute to the phasing out of the surplus, and what relative contributions each one will make to the total?</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07050257000033"></a>My second question concerns the Government&#146;s policy to recover in total, as I understand it, the cost of providing court services. What do they think it appropriate to include in defining &#147;cost&#148;? We have already heard the noble Lord, Lord Lester, make some important observations about capital costs. To what extent do the Government think it appropriate to charge capital costs on the sort of capital expenditure to which the noble Lord referred?</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07050257000034"></a>My third question concerns the important contribution the Civil Justice Council is making to this debate. What weight do the Government give to principles that compete with the principle of recovering the total cost of the provision of court services? Recently the Civil Justice Council made the following observation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="07050257000045"></a>&#147;The Council considers that the policy of recovering almost the full cost of running the civil justice system from litigants is wrong in principle in that it fails to recognise the significant element of collective benefit in the administration of civil justice, not least for those who do not become involved in proceedings. It is in the collective interest that an efficient and authoritative means for resolving dispute should exist, that the law should be clarified and developed, that the power of the executive should be checked, and that human rights should be safeguarded&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70502-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07050257000035"></a>My final question is to endorse and amplify the point the noble Lord, Lord Lester, made about access to justice. This ought to be a crucial component of the Government&#146;s approach to this issue. Have the Government undertaken an analysis of the impact of their approach on access to justice? Furthermore, has a view been taken about the combined impact of the approach together with recent changes in legal aid rules? I emphasise a further point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, because I regard it as very important: what impact has the Government&#146;s policy had on socially excluded groups? I underline what a debt the House owes to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, for bringing this matter to its attention. We are all fortunate that he keeps his eye on a whole range of issues connected with access to justice, of which this is just one.</p>

This is an issue with a long history, as he knows better than many. True it is that, were Lord Ackner present today, I would no doubt be on the receiving end of two fairly acerbic observations. To some extent I am relieved I am not, but I regret that he is not with us because he was a very considerable legal figure.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07050263000002"></a>The primary benefit of civil litigation is usually that the parties involved are those who receive the benefit, and that is perhaps the critical area of distinction between the approaches to the principle here. The Government believe it is right that those who take the primary benefit bear the costs of using the civil courts. The general policy of recovering most of the cost through fees enables better targeting of scarce public resources.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07050263000003"></a>There are essentially three options for funding the civil court system. The first is to maintain the concept of setting fees to reflect cost, so those who have sufficient means to pay the full costs of litigation do so while the taxpayers&#146; contribution is focused on those qualifying for remission or exemption. The second is to subsidise the level of court fees generally by increasing taxes or taking money from, say, the legal aid budget in order to reduce court fees. It should be borne in mind that a wholly free court service would cost some &#163;550 million. That figure has already been alluded to. Inevitably, the third option is to cut costs and therefore fees by slashing court services, closing courts and sacking staff, which, of course, no one would want.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07050263000004"></a>Court fees have to comply with the general policy principles that apply to all services where the Government charge fees authorised by Parliament. The most important is that fees should not exceed the total cost of providing the service. Fees cannot be set to make a profit. All fee-charging services must have a financial objective agreed with the Treasury. For civil court fees, the objective is to recover the total cost, not counting the cost of providing fee exemptions and remissions. In other words, although the term is often used, the target is not full-cost recovery. A better way of describing the policy is full-cost pricing. This means that fees should generally be set at levels which, on average, if charged in every case rather than waived, would recover the full cost of providing the service.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07050263000005"></a>Full-cost pricing, together with a system of concessions to protect the least well-off, is the better way of targeting the taxpayer&#146;s contribution at where it is most needed. Furthermore, many fees in family proceedings are currently set at levels well below full cost. These include, in particular, the fees for domestic violence, adoption and public law childcare cases. So the taxpayer makes, and will continue to make, a significant contribution to the cost of running the civil and family courts. In 2005-06, court fees represented 79 per cent of the total cost.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07050263000006"></a>The part of cost not covered by fees is met by the general taxpayer as part of the resource budget ofthe Department for Constitutional Affairs. The taxpayer&#146;s contribution is made up of two elements: potential fee income forgone under the system of

This is currently the case with many fees for family proceedings generally and for civil proceedings in the magistrates&#146; courts.</p>

<a name="70502-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07050263000007"></a>In 2005-06, the latter subsidy was partly offset by the fact that civil fees in the county courts and above recorded significantly more than the cost of these proceedings. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, observed, the over-recovery for that year came to some &#163;34 million. That arose partly from the difference between forecasts made in June 2005 and the actual outturn and partly as a result of the new costing model identifying a more accurate allocation of cost between services. The Treasury agreed that the over-recovery can be phased out over the spending review period of 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07050263000008"></a>I was asked how the figures in the fees-and-charges approach will be dealt with. As I understand it, these figures are based on actual income and expenditure with shared and overhead costs allocated between services on the basis of the new model. The allocation would be through civil, family and probate. The recent fee increases were based on forecast income and expenditure using the old model. These figures showed a substantial over-recovery using full cost for civil and probate but lower recovery rates than intended on the other services. Civil fee income in the higher courts exceeded full cost by 15 per cent of an excess net income worth around &#163;34 million. The probate recovery was 30 per cent&#151;an excess of almost &#163;4 million. The equivalent surpluses in 2006-07 are likely to be rather larger because of the full-year effect of the recent fee increases and the impact on civil and probate costs of the expenditure cuts. The recent increases are not the principal reason for the over-recovery; they were set to raise about&#163;4 million in 2005-06&#151;about 11 per cent of the process.</p>

<a name="70502-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07050263000009"></a>We have developed a package of fee measures for implementation in August 2007, which, among other things, addresses the recovery issue. In other words, reductions in civil and probate should be offset by increases elsewhere so that we avoid over-recovery and have a neutral or better impact on the net departmental expenditure limit. We envisage that the August 2007 package will also include changes arising from the exemption and remission and fee structure reviews mentioned above. The former is likely to increase the loss of income that will have to be recovered through the departmental budget.</p>

<a name="70502-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07050263000010"></a>I should say something in this context regarding access to justice via exemption and the remission process. Approximately 5 million people are in receipt of specified means-tested benefits or tax credits who are eligible for automatic exemption from court fees. Thus anyone not qualifying for exemption but who would suffer financial hardship if required to pay fees whether in full or in part may be granted remission in full or in part. The current test for remission is based on both income and expenditure and takes full account of all a person&#146;s commitments and liabilities, not just how much money they have or receive. Setting fees generally at levels lower than a full-cost price would

These are public expenditure decisions for the Government; what the state provides free or at a charge is essentially a matter of policy for government. The issue of determining priorities in the allocation of scarce public resources inevitably arises. We recognise, of course, that citizens in a democracy under the rule of law have a constitutional right of access to a court system, but&#151;this is the critical point&#151;it is not a constitutional right to free access, provided those who cannot pay are protected.</p>

<a name="70502-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07050263000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, raised the question of the practical impact of the charging policy. The department has no evidence to suggest that charging court fees is affecting the number of cases coming to court. One should bear in mind that court fees represent a much smaller proportion of the cost of civil litigation than legal fees. One must note that legal aid, together with a system of concessions, exists to protect access to justice for the less well-off.</p>

<a name="70502-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07050263000012"></a>Current statistics show that the number of specified debt claims has steadily increased by 28 per cent since 2002, which suggests that there is no chilling effect on litigation proceeding in this area. However, as part of the long-term fee strategy, the department has commissioned a detailed piece of research to identify the consequences of fee charging. This may provide an answer to the question&#151;I believe that it was his fourth&#151;asked by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. The research hopes to identify what the impact of fee changes might be on users and to identify any users who may be prevented from accessing the courts due to increases. The outcome of the research will be formally published in July 2007.</p>

Research should establish whether that belief is correct. As regards the general point of access to justice and whether the system is capable of improvement, the answer is yes; it would be foolish to suggest otherwise.

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07050263000018"></a>The longer term is important to Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service, and we will continue to review and reform that service.

That consultation will end on 25 June, and it is an opportunity for those who consider this matter strongly to make their views clear. In conclusion, I confirm that the department&#146;s plans, as set out in the fee strategy and more recently in the fee consultation paper, are concerned, as we all are, with the fairness of the issue, while considering the financial obligation of the Government.</p>

<a name="70502-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07050265000008"></a>There is no need for an express charging power or a duty to charge for any services being provided. As with any government department, the board will be subject to cross-government rules and guidelines on what it may charge for services. These rules are designed to ensure that government departments and public bodies charge appropriately. For example, as with any government department, the board will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, competition law and the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations so far as selling information for commercial re-use is concerned. The board will be subject also to a range of cross-governmental administrative rules that set out when it would be able to charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07050265000009"></a>The problem with the amendment is that the board would lose this flexibility. The amendment is unnecessary, as the board will be covered by the wider detailed framework on charging for services that applies to all government departments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07050265000010"></a>The noble Baroness may be right that services may be provided to third-world countries on the basis of funding from the Department for International Development, but it is not for us to specify such arrangements in the Bill. The board will fit into the pattern of all public bodies and be subject to the same rules governing the basis on which it may charge. It has the right to do so; none of its functions is obligatory.

As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said, the Government envisage that the chief statistician will, in order to meet the Prime Minister, have to negotiate with a Cabinet Secretary who might just say, &#147;No, I&#146;m terribly sorry, but he&#146;s going to be busy for the next few weeks or months&#148;. That is not adequate. It does not reflect the situation that obtained when the noble Lord, Lord Moser, was chief statistician and it does not reflect the importance of the chief statistician, particularly in the circumstances set out by these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07050265000039"></a>We have already argued these points during the Bill&#146;s progress in this House and the other place. The role and status of the National Statistician is strong in this Bill. The nearest comparators are the Government&#146;s Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser. While neither of those is a statutory appointment, and while both are leaders of their respective professions in government, they have no statutory right of access to the Prime Minister, nor are there requirements on the Government to follow their advice or to give reasons if they do not do so.</p>

<a name="70502-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07050265000040"></a>The bedrock of this system is transparency and accountability to Parliament. The board and the National Statistician are required to act openly, which includes publishing the results of assessments against the code. They publish any advice or concerns about statistics across government. Open discourse is the best assurance of the role of the National Statistician, but we intend that she shall continue to enjoy the right of access to the Prime Minister if so required.</p>

For obvious reasons, I understand the importance of the amendment that was carried in Committee the other day, but I do not think that that affects the right of the National Statistician and the significance of his role.

The amendment has nothing to do with the amendments that we moved successfully last week, which replaced &#147;Treasury&#148; with &#147;Cabinet Office&#148; on the residual functions that reside with the Government. This is a question of whether the National Statistician gains access to the Prime Minister through the Cabinet Secretary or goes directly to the Prime Minister. It is a matter of extreme importance because, had Mr Healey not said that he had to go through the Cabinet Secretary, I suspect that there would not have been such concern about the arrangements intended to operate for the National Statistician under the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07050265000046"></a>I do not think that the Minister is right in saying that access has always been through the Cabinet Secretary. It may have been since 2000, when the new framework was established; if so, that is a pity. However, we are looking to see the full practice reinstated with the right of direct access. One can understand that a strong Cabinet Secretary, approached by a Permanent Secretary when he knows what will be criticised directly to the Prime Minister, can make it extremely difficult for the National Statistician to see the Prime Minister, unless the National Statistician has the statutory right of direct access.</p>

I am aware that the noble Lord, Lord Moser, goes a long way back in terms of his service to government and it may well be that he had a somewhat different arrangement. It certainly was not a statutory right, but that is what the amendment seeks to achieve. I was reflecting what I understood to be the National Statistician&#146;s rights of access. It may well be that the noble Lord, Lord Moser&#151;such is his reputation and the recognition of his significant role&#151;enjoyed privileges that might not be vouchsafed to everyone.

As I implied with my earlier amendment, my motivation stems from my concern about the extent to which the Government envisage that the board should, or should not, become a conduit for the wider dissemination of raw data, rather than statistics, throughout Whitehall and conceivably beyond.</p>

<a name="70502-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07050265000055"></a>The Minister sought earlier to offer me some reassurance on the point by referring to Clause 44(9). However, I am not convinced that that provision affords me all that much comfort. Clause 24(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="07050265000081"></a>&#147;The Board may do anything which it thinks necessary or expedient&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050265000073"></a>Its potential scope therefore, in so far as it is not confined to &#147;statistical&#148; function, is extremely wide. I acknowledge that up to a point it may be constrained by virtue of the reference to &#147;ancillary&#148; powers, but, by the same token, there is no indication in the Bill as to what these may be. Accordingly, it is mildly tempting to suppose that the clause offers an open invitation to function creep.</p>

<a name="70502-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07050265000056"></a>It may well be that I am being unnecessarily obtuse. Nevertheless, it would be helpful to know whether the Government&#146;s intention is that the power granted is to be limited to &#147;statistical&#148; function alone or whether it is intended to go wider. If it is the latter, it would be helpful to know the sort of circumstances in which the Government envisage the power being exercised. Indeed, I should be grateful if he could provide some practical examples.</p>

The purpose of a clause of this nature is to give the board the necessary powers to transact its day-to-day business. It does not widen the scope of the board&#146;s activities, nor does it provide any powers of compulsion. If it helps noble Lords, I will list some of the things that we expect the board may do under the power&#151;enter agreements, acquire and dispose of property and promote or assist the promotion of publicity about the work of the board. These powers will also entitle the board to charge for certain services on a discretionary basis as ONS currently does; for example, for paper copies of its publications, for any statistical services it provides and for services promoting statistical research.</p>

This is an important clause. Its effectiveness will be considerably enhanced by making the board examine its own efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and include that appraisal in its annual report.

It is now commonplace that organisations have an audit committee comprising non-executive members. The idea has been largely developed in the private sector, but is widely used in the public sector.

However, rightly, it does not specify the names and functions of specific committees that must be established. The Government fully expect that the board will use that power to establish an independent and objective audit committee, chaired by an independent non-executive member, as set out in the code on corporate governance and following the guidance set out in the <I>Audit Committee Handbook</I>.</p>

<a name="70502-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07050268000009"></a>In addition, the Government expect Parliament to play the central role in holding the statistical system to account. There will be full accountability to Parliament as much for this aspect of the board&#146;s work as for others. For example, in the extremely unlikely event that the board failed to establish an audit committee, I have no doubt that that would be a matter of fundamental concern to Parliament and it would call the board to account for that failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07050268000010"></a>In those circumstances, we do not think it necessary to legislate for an audit committee. It is for the independent board to determine how it sets up its committees, including the details of their membership, and it is not

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07050268000011"></a>As I have said in previous debates, we do not think it necessary to stipulate the contents of the board&#146;s annual report. Clause 25 already requires the board&#146;s annual report to cover what it has done and what it has found each year, and within that remit, we think we should allow the board to use its own judgment, following good practice guidance, to ensure that the most pertinent information about its activities are reported each year. I hope my explanation is satisfactory to the noble Baroness.</p>

The reference to Parliament in Clause 26 therefore will ensure that reports will be laid before each House, without the need for further elaboration.

I affirm the importance of spreading public services, including Civil Service work, around Britain, and I have been involved in a good number of such exercises. However, a certain finesse is needed where the function is by its nature a central Whitehall function; hence the three factors in the amendment which we say the board must take into account: first, the need to recruit and retain suitably skilled and experienced employees; secondly, the need to maintain effective contacts with users of statistics, particularly in central government; and, thirdly, the need to maintain the influence of official statistics on policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07050268000037"></a>In making the case, I am relying substantially on a briefing from the Association of First Division Civil Servants&#151;the FDA&#151;which is the union for senior civil servants. It is a TUC affiliate, so I am told that I should declare an interest in that FDA members also help to pay my pension. The central issue raised by the amendment relates to the location of the ONS and whether the board will have a coherent job of work to do. If the determination of the location of ONS staff is excluded&#151;if, for example, the board is precluded from deciding that the national accounts section must be at the heart of Whitehall&#151;I fear that the standing and reputation of the board will be negligible from the start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07050268000038"></a>An ONS-commissioned survey of 2006 on the business case for ONS relocation from 2008 onwards states on page 7:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="07050268000071"></a>&#147;Looking beyond March 2008 the Government&#146;s plans to convert the statistical side of ONS to become a non ministerial department reporting to an independent governing board ... These organisational changes will have little or no impact on the ONS relocation programme ... however any decision taken after the conversion will be the responsibility of the independent governing board&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050268000060"></a>That raises two important questions: one about reversibility; the other about responsibility. The survey also states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="07050268000072"></a>&#147;There is some reluctance on behalf of the National Accounts Group and the Methodologists to embrace the proposed change to re-locate outside of London and they hold strong views on the likely risks to the business if this change is adopted. Their concerns are mainly around the ability to retain existing staff and recruit new, suitably qualified and experienced staff outside of the London area. This may have an impact on the quality of statistical output in relationships with key customers and stakeholders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70502-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07050268000039"></a>I submit that it must be part of the board&#146;s scope to conclude, if it so wishes, that the current move to take all ONS activities out of London, mainly to Newport, has caused a loss of morale and efficiency. The survey&#146;s figures on senior civil servants are quite astounding&#151;I shall give them in a moment. All colleagues who have taken part in these debates will have seen the FDA&#146;s evidence to the Treasury Select Committee to which I am referring. The FDA points out that it is not simply making a trade union point, by any manner of means; it is expressing deep dismay at the impact on professional standards. It points out that no other country in Europe, with the exception of Germany, which has a highly federal structure, has a significant national statistical office presence in its capital city. Moreover, the demotion of ONS is not just from the outskirts of London, but from what we have always known as the Treasury building just across the road. We all know that in whatever walk of life we come from, access to and location close to the highest level correlates with the degree to which our function is taken seriously. If, in effect, none of the functions of the staff of the ONS is located in Whitehall, it looks a bit like a circus animal. The ONS will have a small presence here just to serve the board, with everyone else somewhere else.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07050268000040"></a>The other point made is that the Newport labour market is not going to produce the specialist skills required to draw up, for example, the national accounts. The FDA concludes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="07050268000073"></a>&#147;The FDA believes that the ONS is at crisis point. The cumulative impact of the need to deliver efficiency savings, the

</ul>
<p><a name="07050268000061"></a>I shall mention two of the survey results. Only 11 per cent of ONS senior civil servants think that the organisation is well managed, which is 40 percentage points lower than for the Civil Service as a whole. The second result is that 11 per cent of ONS senior civil servants think change is well managed in the organisation, which is 22 percentage points lower than for the Civil Service overall.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07050268000041"></a>I have some sympathy with an observation that could be made: this is most unfair on the senior managers of the ONS. I think it is most unfair, but I have quoted the facts. It is most unfair that they are the people carrying the can in these circumstances&#151;we have all been there and got the T-shirt&#151;and have to take all the opprobrium of such a relocation.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07050268000042"></a>I want to put on the record my personal thanks to the director of ONS for her courtesy and ready agreement to arrange for a senior colleague from Newport to come to the House of Lords and discuss with me over a cup of tea some factual questions concerning statistics on income distribution and how the &#163;30 billion or &#163;40 billion paid out in City bonuses fit into the published data based on averages for all employment pay increases widely quoted in inflation analyses, or excluded as the case may be. This is against a background where the board, if it is to have any authority, needs to have the whip hand over the Treasury on the publication of statistics on things like income distribution, not the other way around. Is that sort of signal being sent at this point in time? The answer to that question, in the vernacular, is &#147;You must be joking&#148;. The ONS seems to have been set efficiency targets by Gershon, on top of Lyons, so hence the relocation targets. But I have to say that if anyone were to define cost cutting as synonymous with efficiency, we would call it a caricature.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07050268000043"></a>To recapitulate: first, after these changes, will there continue to be a significant London presence? I think the answer is no. Some 700 ONS staff are still here at the moment, but they will virtually disappear. Secondly, will it be possible to get staff with the specialist skills needed if London is closed down?The answer, I submit, is no. Thirdly, will there be a significant loss of experience through people resigning? The answer to that is yes. Fourthly, was there or is there still room for a compromise, such as keeping national accounts in London? That was rejected out of hand, so everybody will go. I do not see why that proposition has to be rejected out of hand.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07050268000044"></a>My noble friend should be able to find a way to show ONS staff some light at the end of the tunnel&#151;and I do not mean just the light at the end of the Severn Tunnel on the Great Western Railway. The location changes must not be set in concrete before the board gets to work. An assurance is needed that if&#151;I believe when&#151;the board concludes that the comprehensive nature of the relocation has gone over the top and that it is damaging the quality of national statistics, the board will be able to make the necessary adjustments. So the changes cannot be set in concrete and some may need to be reversed, as the Irish

At Second Reading and in Committee last week I raised the issue which he has raised in greater detail today. Since last week I have had a chance to read for the first time the FDA evidence to the Treasury Select Committee. That is the most damning document one could read of a decision to relocate any department anywhere in the UK given that one is talking about the FDA. It is not the miners&#146; union led by Arthur Scargill. One has to take what it says extremely seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07050268000046"></a>As a matter of principle, we on these Benches have been great supporters of relocation. Indeed, my noble friend in another place, Dr Cable, has argued thatthe whole Treasury should move to Liverpool&#151;a suggestion of which the Treasury has not approved with the alacrity with which it is forcing people from ONS to go down to south Wales. But there comes a point where, however much one might favour the principle of relocation, the cost and benefits weigh the other way. It seems to me that in respect of certain of the functions of the ONS, as the noble Lord, Lord Lea, explained, the argument for moving to Newport has not been made.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07050268000047"></a>Last week I referred to information which had been passed to me from someone who currently works for the ONS. It was claimed that, as of a fortnight ago, of the division which produces the RPI and the CPI&#151;it has a staff of 35&#151;not one of them had chosen to relocate to Newport and that there were serious risks to the production of those statistics over the coming months. Does the Minister recognise those figures and that danger? What action will the Treasury take if it believes that there is a serious risk that major statistical series will be disrupted if the move, as currently planned, goes ahead?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07050268000048"></a>As regards the role and powers of the board, if the amendment were passed, to reverse the changes, I fear that that could be extremely difficult unless it were possible to relocate back at a cost saving. As wehave heard from the Minister, a five-year financial settlement has been agreed with the ONS which is predicated on the move to Newport being successfully concluded, with the reductions in costs that that brings with it.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07050268000049"></a>While I support the amendment and the sentiments underlying it, unless the Minister is about to tell me that the settlement can be re-opened, I have some doubts that it is a reversible situation.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07050268000051"></a>There are two issues in relation to the amendment. First, in relation to Newport, is the position reversible? Does it have to happen? What are the cost implications  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1144"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the five-year settlement? That is one range of issues for the here and now. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, and the noble Lord, Lord Lea, referred to the serious practical difficulties that the ONS appears to be encountering in being able to carry on its ordinary work given the unattractiveness to many of the ONS staff of relocating to Newport. It is, in fact, a very nice place to go, but I do not think that it could be regarded as somewhere we would expect statisticians to want to congregate in large numbers. It is not a natural statistical centre of the world or surprising that existing staff will not want to go there in large numbers. That is one set of issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07050268000052"></a>My second set of issues concerns the future freedom of the board, which is also very important. We are told that this is a non-ministerial department, but we have never really had teased out what goes with being such a department. Does it mean that you get bullied by Lyons mark 2 or Goschen mark 3 into doing something you do not want to do or does the board actually have freedom? We have been told many times in Committee that the board will be trusted to do the right things, but we have never really had spelt out the constraints on the board&#146;s freedoms, so I welcome the debate that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lea, has allowed us to have on this issue.</p>

The Government should listen very seriously to what he has said. The comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, reflect the seriousness of the situation; that is, the statisticians who compile the CPI and the RPI will not be moving, which is a very dangerous situation. There will be a board, but no employees. The noble Lord, Lord Lea, is right to recommend that the board has the power to move to wherever it is necessary to get the right quality of employees.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Newby, raised this issue at Second Reading and I referred to the29 targets that the Office for National Statistics is bidden to meet. The noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, has thrashed out the bare bones of what we were asking at Second Reading. We have not had any answers to those worries. I referred earlier today to whether it is possible for the Statistics Board to hit the ground running. I simply do not believe that it is. I feel very strongly about the combination of where the Office for National Statistics is coming from, the regime under which it has been controlled to date and what is expected to happen with all this independence and rebuilding of public trust as the objective. Quite frankly, it will not happen unless someone takes a serious look at this Bill and makes many important changes between now and Third Reading.</p>

I want to put in context the Government&#146;s policy on relocating activity outside London and the south-east. It developed followingSir Michael Lyons&#146; independent review of relocation, published three years ago, which argued that government was located too much in London and the south-east, to the detriment of other nations and regions within the UK. The Government welcomed thatreport.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07050268000056"></a>The Lyons review argued that relocation offers value-for-money gains, with departments able to take advantage of significantly lower rents and potentially lower labour costs in other regions by aligning pay with local labour market conditions. Unnecessarily locating Government activities in the most expensive part of the UK does not make sense. I ask whether anyone quarrels with those important propositions. Relocating posts out of London also increases opportunities in other parts of the UK, such as allowing people from other locations to join the Civil Service. Relocation delivers economic benefits for an area by creating valuable jobs. New locations can be a spur for new ways of working, adopting better business practices, processes and technology, and reforming organisational culture. That is why the Government are making steady progress across departments in terms of relocation. The Ministry of Defence has moved 1,900 posts, the Home Office is moving 1,300 posts and the Department for Work and Pensions is moving 3,900. They are not just operational posts; policy work is also moving. For example, DfID has moved various policy teams from London to Scotland. Specialist work is also being moved: 150 posts in the Department of Health and a former NHS information service have migrated from offices in London and the south-east to Leeds.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07050269000003"></a>The ONS has a part to play in this wider strategy. It is relocating jobs out of London. I might add that accommodation costs are five times higher in London than they are in Newport, where most of the relocation is going. In circumstances where we all recognise the burden of London housing costs when it comes to the question of recruitment, the advantages that Newport offers will be recognised. This gives the ONS an opportunity to create a new structure, which will affect efficiency savings.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07050269000004"></a>I recognise that my noble friend has rightly identified the concerns of the FDA about the dislocation caused by the move. Of course there are concerns at this stage, and it is important that the ONS responds to them. That is why there are significant relocation packages to encourage staff to relocate to south Wales and to provide support and additional training for them. It is recognised that asking staff to do this involves a degree of sacrifice on their part. But these are issues that the FDA and the other unions involved are well equipped to deal with, with regard to managers. I recognise what my noble friend is indicating; namely, that there is some dislocation that is causing anxiety at this stage. These issues need to be addressed, but my noble friend will also recognise that the current process is at probably its most stressful position.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07050269000005"></a>I might add that Newport is not the end of the world, certainly not for statisticians. There is a significant ONS office already in Newport, so we are asking  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1146"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people to relocate not to a new site but to a well established office with much statistical expertise already in place. I recognise the commonsense point that my noble friend expressed so graphically, that the closer one is to key policy-makers, the louder one&#146;s voice may be&#151;or one thinks that it is&#151;and that one does not need such a loud voice when one can whisper around the corner rather than calling from afar. That is a matter to take on board. The board will have to take responsibility for ensuring that this relocation does not adversely affect the quality of its work. But there is no evidence that that has been the case in other departments, and I see no reason for thinking that ONS managers will be any less successful than the Department of Health, for example, has been in moving its specialist workers.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07050269000006"></a>However, the concerns need to be met. I would be more concerned if my noble friend had had neither sight nor sound of any comment from organisations representing the workforce involved. Far from that being the case, he said that a great deal of activity is being carried out by the First Division Association, which is not a negligible influence on the Government or the Civil Service. I am fully aware of the anxieties that my noble friend expressed, but we are at the most difficult point in the process and machinery is in place to meet the difficulties that have arisen.</p>

<a name="70502-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07050269000007"></a>If the move to Newport were stopped, it would create a very difficult situation. The board would be unlikely to think that that was a judicious action to take. The ONS is fitting into a pattern followedby many government departments. Therefore, the problems associated with relocation are widely known throughout government, as are the benefits. I reiterate that many of the benefits accrue in the longer term. An ONS office exists in the relocation area. Staff will find housing costs in that area a good deal less expensive than they are elsewhere. That represents for many a real improvement in their cost of living although I accept that relocation costs apply in any move. That is why we have packages in place to address that.</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07050269000008"></a>Concern has been expressed on all sides of the Committee about an aspect of policy that generally achieves widespread agreement; namely, that we should seek to spread government functions and Civil Service jobs more widely than has been the case in the past. However, there are always anxieties about the disruption incurred in that. Nevertheless, I have every confidence that the service will meet the requirements imposed on it by these changes. The Office for National Statistics&#151;and, in due course, the board&#151;needs to wrestle with anything that impacts directly on the success of its work. Neither the ONS nor the board would fulfil its duties if the relocation resulted in a deterioration in the work of our statisticians. I have no reason to believe that that will be the outcome, but I appreciate that the needs of the staff should be taken seriously. These are serious issues concerning a service that is of great importance to the nation. The ONS, and subsequently the board when the Bill becomes an Act, is obliged to ensure that this transition is effected in a way that allays the fears of my noble friend and all Members of the Committee who spoke about this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07050269000011"></a>The central fallacy in my noble friend&#146;s brief, which comes from the Treasury, is that it does not compare apples with apples. The first rule of statistics is that you must compare apples with apples. What my noble friend has done&#151;he is a great friend of mine, so I can say this&#151;is compare the minimal move of certain people out of the Ministry of Defence, or the agriculture department or whatever, with a lock, stock and barrel move of the ONS. That is not comparing apples with apples, and no self-respecting statistician would make such an error. Is the Bank of England going to move lock, stock and barrel? Of course not. The same goes for the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07050269000012"></a>I beg my noble friend to look at the three criteria, which have been carefully drafted; they are not just done off the top of someone&#146;s head. The Treasury has not begun to deal with this remotely satisfactorily in the notes that it has prepared. As regards the FDA and the idea that things are over the hump and will get better, I am afraid that the FDA says that it could all get worse. I see no evidence to support the Panglossian view that the relocation has gone through the worst. I regret to say that I will have to table an amendment very much like this on Report, unless my noble friend can think of a way of meeting half way the very logical points that I have made.

Clause 27 creates the usual draconian power of direction which the Government reserve for public bodies. Our natural instinct is to oppose this power remaining in the Bill because it is the very antithesis of the independence that should be created by it. How can there be proper independence for the Statistics Board if it has to look over its shoulder the whole time to see whether it is upsetting the Government or the devolved Administrations? The Government have not made their case for this power to be established in the Bill, which is why we have opposed the Question that Clause 27 stand part of the Bill. The Explanatory Notes offer no specific assistance either. Why is the power needed and in what circumstances do the Government believe that the clause will be activated?</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07050270000003"></a>The Bill refers to a &#147;serious failure&#148; by the board to comply with its objective or to perform any of its functions, but the judgment is that of one man: the Prime Minister, now that our earlier amendments have replaced the Chancellor. Let us suppose that the board had reached a judgment on the proper calculation of efficiency in the National Health Service that showed that the Government&#146;s policies were resulting in a massive waste in the NHS&#151;noble Lords will recognise that this is not a fanciful example&#151;or that the board decided that changes were needed to crime statistics which had the effect of showing the Government&#146;s achievements in a bad light. Again, this is not a fanciful example. What is to stop the Prime Minister stepping in and saying that he considers that the board has not complied with its objective in this regard? He might argue that it would not serve the public good if public trust in the NHS or in the police were so undermined by the new statistics that it would perhaps create social unrest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07050270000004"></a>It is not only the Prime Minister who has this power, but also the devolved Administrations. They have the power to step in and exercise the functions of the board if the direction is not complied with. I believe that this is an unusual component of the  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1149"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column 1149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conventional power of direction, which is why our Amendment No. 144 would delete subsection (12). What precedents exist for such a power&#151;not the power of direction but of step-in? In what circumstances has such a power been used in practice?</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07050270000005"></a>Clause 4 contains the usual, wide-ranging grounds for the removal of the chairman and the other non-executive members. Can the Minister envisage a situation where Clause 27 (12) could be invoked to allow the Government to step in and act, but where the provisions of Clause 4 did not allow the removal of the chairman and the non-executives? I remind the Minister that Clause 4 allows removal where a member is,</p>
<ul><a name="07050270000022"></a>&#147;unable, unfit or unwilling to perform his functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050270000020"></a>Why is that power not good enough to change the board? Why does there have to be a power of direction backed up by the power to step in as well? The Bill is weighted towards circumscribing the independence of the board. That is why we believe that if the power is to remain in the Bill, and especially if it is to include subsection (12), more parliamentary oversight is required.</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07050270000006"></a>It is helpful that the direction is to be laid before Parliament, but that does not amount to a parliamentary process. Accordingly, Amendment No. 135 would require a direction to be made by order. This is a modest amendment, because it requires by virtue of Clause 62 only the negative resolution procedure, of which the Minister will be aware we are normally dismissive. The important point is that it would not impede the operation of an order, if it were ever determined that one were necessary and urgent, but it would allow a parliamentary debate if appropriate. That is an essential protection for the Statistics Board.</p>

That secret weapon of control will be made less sinister if all parties know that Parliament will have a proper role if the power is used. I beg to move.</p>

It will always be looking over its shoulder at the possibility of a direction being issued under the clause. If it knows that the Cabinet Office, or whoever, must produce an order before Parliament which could be debateable&#151;albeit by the negative procedure&#151;that would be a considerable reassurance and a further indication of the distancing of Ministers from the day-to-day operation of the board.</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="07050270000009"></a>Almost the first statement that the Government made about the Bill was that the board distances Ministers from the operation of the statistical system. My noble friend&#146;s amendment would be a tangible expression of the Government&#146;s own philosophy. I hope that we will be able to support it.</p>

The noble Baroness is therefore right to raise serious questions about the broad sweep of this clause.</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="07050270000011"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister gave us some idea of what the Government consider the kindof circumstances in which it might be invoked, particularly those in which the Government would not simultaneously invoke the earlier clauses about removing either the chair or non-executive directors. In many circumstances&#151;relatively rare ones, I suspect&#151;that would be the more logical way of doing it. If the Government&#146;s view is that they wish to retain the power, having to come to Parliament to do it would serve as a break on their willingness to do so, as noble Lords have said.</p>

<p><a name="st_214"></a>
<a name="07050270000012"></a><b><a name="70502-0014.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07050270000080"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I assure the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that the clause is as far removed from the day-to-day operations of the board as it is possible to get. The clause embraces the ultimate sanction against the board when there is a failure of such seriousness that the Chancellor acts. In acting, it is inconceivable that there would be no parliamentary response to such a dramatic development.</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="07050270000013"></a>The clause, which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggested was draconian, is actually less powerful in its impact upon the body as a final sanction than exists for the Food Standards Agency, where the Secretary of State can give such directions as he may consider appropriate for the purposes of remedying a serious failure. Similarly, Section 40 of the Environment Act empowers the Secretary of State to direct the Environment Agency on the implementation of any community obligations or international agreements. That is what this clause does in the event of such neglect on the part of the board of its obligations under a European directive. Far from having anything to do with the day-to-day operations of the board, it is the final sanction when there has clearly been a complete breakdown of understanding of what it is necessary for the board to do such as to trigger the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s action. It is inconceivable that such an event would take place without the most widespread public debate and parliamentary response to it. We would be reflecting a very serious crisis in the operation of a board. Moreover, that board, more than the other bodies I referred to earlier, is recognised in terms of its independence and its performance&#151;I refer to the individuals who have held the office of National Statistician and to the Office of National Statistics, which is due to be developed and subsumed into this board.</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07050270000014"></a>I assure noble Lords as strongly as I possibly can that this is the ultimate fall-back position necessary for the Minister responsible for the overall operation of the board&#151;the final sanction that he or she has in circumstances where there has been a significant dereliction of duty and failure. Such a failure, being massively in the public domain, would need to be open to reporting. It is inconceivable within that framework that there

We are describing the position of crisis in the ultimate situation, where there is a breakdown.</p>

<a name="70502-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07050270000015"></a>One or two noble Lords indicated that they hoped that this would never arise. It is highly unlikely that a body as responsible as this board would ever get into these circumstances, but there is a need for a failsafe mechanism for the Minister who is responsible for Parliament and to the people for the discharge of the functions of the board. Therefore, a reserve power is necessary. Otherwise, it must be contended, what is being suggested is that the board could get into a very serious circumstance indeed, without a Minister having any direct responsibility for putting things right.</p>

We asked him to explain why Clause 4 did not give the Minister sufficient powers. The Minister has given other examples of directional powers and I do not believe that they are as severe as this clause, which allows either the relevant Minister or the devolved Administration to step in and exercise the powers of the board. We are less than convinced that this is the right way to go. My amendment proposed a modest parliamentary procedure which would have acted as a backstop. I do not want to carry this over to Report; I would like to seek the opinion of the Chamber.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000147"></a> Before Clause 12, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000148"></a>&#147;Budget</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000149"></a>(1) Schedule 6 to the GLA Act 1999 (procedure for determining the Authority&#146;s consolidated budget requirement) is amended as follows.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000150"></a>(2) Omit paragraph 8(4).&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000008"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment also stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. It would alter the majority of Assembly Members required for the Mayor to get his budget from one third to a simple majority. I proposed &#147;one third&#148; because the Mayor&#146;s proposed budget each year will be rejected only if two thirds of the Assembly vote against it and if two thirds agree an alternative budget. He needs, therefore, only a one-third majority backing.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000009"></a>At Second Reading I said that we were entitled to be informed by the experience of the past seven years, and that does not always mean personalising arguments. The system in issue, the votes that people exercise, the effect of those votes and the powers of those for whom people are asked to vote should be readily understandable if we want greater engagement with the political process generally. My seven years&#146; experience is that the public do not readily understand that the Assembly cannot block the Mayor&#146;s budget when over half of its Members vote against it.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000010"></a>The Government&#146;s argument seems to be that the GLA is based on the model of a strong executive Mayor and that the &#147;two thirds&#148;&#151;or, as I would put it, &#147;one third&#148;&#151;requirement is &#147;entirely appropriate&#148;. In what way is it appropriate other than that it was invented here?</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000011"></a>Of course the current Mayor likes the arrangement; it is very handy. At the most recent budget meeting of the Assembly earlier this year, as each of the component parts of the budget&#151;for the GLA and the four functional bodies&#151;met with a vote of nine for and 16 against, the Mayor shouted &#147;carried&#148; from the public gallery. The Government might have been a little more comfortable if the current incumbent had shown greater subtlety, but he made the point very clearly.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000012"></a>I appreciate, too, that the Government are keen on continuing to promote the strong mayor model, but that is not a universal view. Members of the Committee perhaps read comments by &#147;Robocop&#148;, Mayor Mallon of Middlesbrough, earlier this week, criticising the strong mayoral model, but I do not need to pray him in aid of this argument. It is not necessary to have this voting arrangement on the budget to achieve the strong mayoral model in London. The Mayor has all the executive powers. Even if 50 per cent plus one Assembly Members&#151;a simple majority&#151;voted against the budget, they would still have to agree an alternative, which would not be easy.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000013"></a>The largest proportion of the GLA budget, including all the functional bodies, is made up of grant from central government and from fares in the form of Transport for London&#146;s income through the fare box. The Assembly is very limited in what it could alter in practice.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000014"></a>The design of the Greater London Authority should build on the PR system of election. One of its benefits is that Members have to look for ways of working together, which is generally a matter of finding common-sense solutions. I do not think that this arrangement for the GLA budget assists or reflects that.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000015"></a>At the point where the Assembly could bite and where this new system of government could be shown to be effective, the Government drew back. We now have a system that pleases few people, with the notable exception of the current Mayor. The fact that the current Mayor is such a notable exception in his view should sound a warning bell to us all. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000016"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07050260000175"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> It will not surprise the Committee to hear that we, too, support the amendment. Schedule 6 to the 1999 Act begins:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000151"></a>&#147;It shall be the duty of the Mayor and the Assembly ... to prepare and approve for each financial year ... a consolidated budget for the Authority&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050260000140"></a>As the schedule progresses it becomes apparent that the Assembly can influence the budget only with a two-thirds majority. The amendment seeks to lower that bar, and we throw ourselves wholeheartedly behind it.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000017"></a>The Assembly is set up as a scrutinising body, yet the budget for the whole authority can be covered by a minority, with potentially well over 60 per cent of the Assembly against it. It is staggering that a matter of such importance for the whole of London, which affects all the authority&#146;s functions, can be forced through by an individual faced with such ineffective scrutiny. I support everything that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said on that.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000018"></a>The proposal would give the Assembly the power only to amend not to prepare the budget, which would remain the brainchild of the Mayor.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000020"></a>No doubt all sorts of models could be devised for the structure of Greater London governance. I sat in numerous meetings with some of the people in this Room in the mid-1990s, when we discussed different governance models. However, the Greater London Authority Act set up a particular structure. To change one part of it without recasting the rest is a dangerous way of proceeding. If it is really the belief that you need to have a different governance model, then let us review every aspect of it rather than simply changing one element at a time or, as will happen during the Bill&#146;s progress, making a series of piecemeal changes which change some elements of the structure but not all of it.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000021"></a>There are very strong arguments for saying that the existing model, which says that the Mayor of London is a strong figure, is right for our capital city. Given that the Mayor of London has limited powers compared with mayors of similar cities overseas, it is important that he can exercise them fairly decisively and clearly.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000022"></a>There also seems to be confusion between the role of scrutiny and the role of decision, which surprises me because both noble Lords who have spoken so far are highly experienced in precisely that distinction. My experience, although admittedly I was on the London Assembly for only four years, is that its scrutiny of a number of aspects of the budget was extremely detailed and effective. It highlighted issues that needed attention, and they were, by and large, attended to. However, that is a different process from one of decision. To say that the Assembly by a simple majority is to determine the budget is to transfer the bulk of the Mayor of London&#146;s power to the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000023"></a>Will the Committee consider the implications of the proposal? You would have a Mayor, directly elected by the people of London, clearly visible and expected to carry out certain functions, who could not, without the support of the majority of the Assembly for those actions, guarantee that he would be able to take at least some of them forward. That would be less of a problem and have fewer consequences if there were a different system for electing the Assembly or if the Assembly was of a different type. As far as I can see, nothing in the amendments suggests that the Assembly election system should be changed. Indeed, I should be very surprised to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, suggest a move away from a system of proportional representation for the Assembly. Yet only if there were a parallel system of election could you really argue that this was an appropriate way in which to determine the functions.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000024"></a>My objections to this amendment are, first, that the change should not be made without a fundamental review of how the entire GLA structure operates, and, secondly and perhaps more importantly, that London deserves strong leadership and governance, neither of which it will get through this proposal.</p>

Anything that seeks to confuse his role as the leader, accountable for his decisions, is a backwards step. In that sense, I entirely support what the noble Lord, Lord Harris, said. However, it is arguable whether this rule that there must be a two-thirds majority of the Assembly on the budget achieves what we seek. We all agree that the Assembly needs to be in a position to carry out effective scrutiny; I am not entirely clear that the rule enables the Assembly to hold the Mayor to account on whether he is spending his money wisely and well, as I would want it to be able to do, but not to decide how he spends his money. For example, he has probably spent too much money on buses, and it would have been good if someone had held him to account for that.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000026"></a>The other aspect of the current model that I dislike is that it has the unintended consequence of getting the Mayor to align with minority parties to gethis budget through. That seems an unintended consequence on anybody&#146;s part.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000027"></a>The conclusion that I reluctantly draw is that the current situation is the best that we can have, but I am concerned about financial accountability.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000028"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07050260000178"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Harris, is correct in so far as we probably ought to change the whole system, but we are where we are with the GLA. This is a new Bill, with certain provisions that we are entitled to look at, and that undoubtedly includes the budget.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000029"></a>I had barely joined this House when the first GLA Bill was introduced, but I recall that there was an expectation that the Mayor&#146;s precept would be remarkably low. Many spoke about whether he would be able to raise sufficient money from his budget at the level considered. The Bill went through on that basis. By extraordinary chance, the Mayor has managed to double&#151;double&#151;his precept since he came into power. Neither the Assembly nor the London electorate has been unable to stop him doing that. There is no doubt that he has found ways of ensuring that he can get from the London taxpayer a great deal more money than was ever envisaged.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000030"></a>There has to be some check on what the Mayor can do. Everybody foresaw such problems from the outset. The scrutiny role of the Assembly should include a holding power, particularly in relation to the budget and precept, and some way of tugging the Mayor back; otherwise, nothing will stop the precept from increasing, and it cannot keep going up at the current rate.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000031"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07050260000179"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> I am grateful to the Committee for that short discussion, which is the start of a very important debate. It represents a debate that we will have in different forms about the Assembly settlement, which will work itself out as the Bill is discussed. This is probably the most important amendment in this group; it reflects some robust, yet relatively simple,  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>political realities, to which my noble friend Lord Harris referred. As emphasised, inevitably it would undermine the GLA model of governance: a strong mayoral executive and an Assembly holding the Mayor to account through effective scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000032"></a>I shall run through the changes that Members of the Committee would like to discuss. Obviously, the key change that we have introduced, which is very simple but important, deals with the procedure for determining the authority&#146;s consolidated budget requirement. Clause 12 will give the Assembly, for the first time, its own component budget. That should not be underestimated, as it marks our commitment to giving the Assembly greater financial autonomy and a clearer focus on its scrutiny role. The Assembly has welcomed that, but it has opened up the debate about its powers to amend the budget.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000033"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that people did not understand the work of the Assembly, and we need to think about that. By giving the Assembly its own budget, that process will become more transparent and clearer. Under our revisions, which I want to run through briefly, Clause 12 provides for separate component budget requirements. The Mayor and Assembly budgets now make up six budgets rather than the four functional budgets that we had previously. Together they make up the consolidated budget requirement for the GLA group.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000034"></a>Clause 13 revises the procedures for determining the GLA consolidated budget simply to incorporate the new Mayor and Assembly budgets into the process. It is worth thinking about the process because part of my argument will rest on how these different stages offer different opportunities for checks and balances.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000035"></a>The Mayor must now prepare a first draft consolidated GLA budget after preparing six draft component budgets. He has to consult the Assembly before preparing both the Mayor and Assembly draft component budgets. He must present the draft consolidated budget to the Assembly on or before1 February in the financial year preceding the one to which the draft consolidated budget relates. The Assembly must approve the first draft and the six draft component budgets it comprises, with or without amendment, by a simple majority.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000036"></a>I can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, that that is where the first stage of accountability kicks in. The simple majority will enable the Assembly to influence what is happening at that early stage. But the Assembly&#146;s power to increase its own draft component budget by amendment has been limited by the Bill so that its annual percentage increase must not be more than the annual percentage increase in the Mayor&#146;s component budget. We will talk about that in later amendments. For example, if the Mayor proposes a 3 per cent increase in his own budget compared with the previous year, against a 2 per cent increase in the Assembly budget, the Assembly may increase its own budget by up to 1 per cent. That calculation is set out in Clause 13(5).</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000037"></a>Similarly, if the Mayor proposes to decrease his own budget by 1 per cent, the Assembly may not amend its own budget such that the decrease, compared  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the previous year, is less than 1 per cent. That does not mean that the Assembly&#146;s budget could never increase by more than the Mayor&#146;s, year on year, but the Mayor would need to propose such an increase. Those arrangements would ensure that the Assembly could not award itself excessive increases in its budget, and that is reasonable.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000038"></a>The Mayor, informed by the Assembly&#146;s considerations, must then prepare a final draft of the proposed consolidated budget, which it must approve, with or without amendment, before the last day of February in the financial year preceding that to which the budget relates.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000039"></a>Two contextual points were implied by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. First, the Assembly does not have an option to reject the final draft budget. As my noble friend Lord Harris said, Schedule 6 to the Greater London Authority Act makes it clear that the Assembly must approve the final draft budget, either as it stands or by amending it by a two-thirds majority. Secondly, the Assembly has the power, if it so chooses, to amend the component budgets and, in so doing, amend the consolidated budgets. That is another check. There is nothing to stop that. The fact that the Assembly has not done that does not mean that it cannot do so. Therefore, by implication, that amends the consolidated budget.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000040"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07050260000180"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I am not as familiar with the workings of the GLA as I am with those of Essex County Council. The noble Baroness said that the first draft must be passed by the Assembly. What if it does not pass the first draft? She said that it has to pass the later drafts. What if the Assembly rejected the first draft?</p>

<p><a name="07050260000041"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07050260000181"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> That is the point I was trying to make. The Assembly does not have the option to reject.</p>

However he is required&#151;rather as he will now be required to respond to consultations on the strategy&#151;to say why he does not accept them.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000045"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07050260000185"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I would not dispute that. The noble Baroness may wish to take advantage of an invitation to talk through with us some of those consultations before Report.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000046"></a>The Assembly&#146;s ability to amend its budget is limited, and we will deal with that in later amendments. Why have we done it this way? We can all agree that it is right, timely and proper to give the Assembly its own  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC63"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>budget. Its consolidated budget represents &#163;11 billion of expenditure on strategic services: public transport, the police, fire and emergency services, economic development and regeneration, and the budget for City Hall. The budget process has worked well. It has been predictable and has delivered for London, particularly on policing and transport. The Bill involves as little disruption and change as possible.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000047"></a>In order to deal with unusual one-off payments, such as the Olympic precept, the authority&#146;s chief finance officer may direct that specified amounts are left out of the budget requirement calculations for the purpose of determining that limit. We will come on to that in a later amendment.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000048"></a>As part of this complicated set of provisions, reflected in the amendments, a parallel set of &#147;virtual&#148; arrangements in Clause 14 makes similar provisions for subsidy calculations.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000049"></a>I listened to the arguments on the amendments but I cannot agree with them, because there are built-in checks and balances. First, the Assembly keeps its existing power to amend the first draft budget by simple majority, which allows it to give the Mayor a clear and early signal of concern, disagreement and controversy and enables him to change his later drafts. Secondly, it has the power to amend by a two-thirds majority, which ensures that, under the strong mayoral model, there is consensus on the budget. The challenge for the political parties in the Assembly&#151;this is where we come to the realpolitik&#151;is to work together to maximise its influence over the preparation of the budget. That is the democratic way of doing it, and I believe that it is better for the reputation of the Assembly if it galvanises its forces rather than our making arrangements for that to happen by guaranteeing a simple majority. With this new power over the budget, it will be able to focus on doing that. It would go down far better with Londoners if the Assembly were seen to have the courage of its convictions. I do not think it is necessary to have a PR system to build coalitions.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000050"></a>Two short quotations support the case. First, the GLA&#146;s own website shows that the Assembly has made a distinct contribution to this process. It states: </p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000152"></a>&#147;The London Assembly has saved Londoners more than&#163;125 million by reining in the Mayor&#146;s budget&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050260000141"></a>That is confirmation of the positive power. Secondly, in the other place, the opposition spokesman Michael Gove said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000153"></a>&#147;Far from being an ineffectual scrutiny body, the GLA&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050260000142"></a>I think he meant the Assembly&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07050260000167"></a>&#147;can be a powerful one, if it can command the votes required&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Greater London Authority Bill Committee, 9/1/07; col. 60.]</ul>
<p><a name="07050260000143"></a>I think that that is a rallying cry. Referring to the strong mayoral model, Robert Neill MP said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050260000154"></a>&#147;We do not have a problem with that model&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Greater London Authority Bill Committee, 9/1/07; col. 71.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050260000144"></a>I am therefore not clear why noble Lords are trying to change the model, which the amendment would do. It would enable a narrow majority of Assembly Members to decide London&#146;s strategic budget, it would overturn a successful model and, as my noble friend said, it  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would introduce real confusion between the scrutiny and executive functions. I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, said about the benefits of that model and the certainty that it brings. It would create the risk that the Assembly would routinely take on the executive function of setting the budget and it would be a recipe for confusion.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000051"></a>There is one other, strong argument. Such a change would not stop at London; it would have implications for other local authorities run on the mayoral model. The two-thirds rule also applies to mayor-in-cabinet and mayor-in-council management models up and down the country. We need to think very seriously about the implications of introducing such a change.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000052"></a>On those grounds, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.</p>

None of them surprised me much, except, perhaps, the Minister&#146;s explanation that the Assembly can amend component budgets. I am grateful for her offer of discussions outside the Committee on that. We would certainly like to discuss it with her because there is clearly some difficulty over the interpretation of the GLA Act. There has been some controversy about the ability of the Assembly to amend components&#151;I had proposed to mention this in the next-but-one group of amendments. The Assembly has been advised that it must vote on the one amount at the end of the day, which has affected how the components are dealt with. If there is a vote against the whole budget because one part is not acceptable, as has happened, it is easily characterised as a vote against the parts that are acceptable. This has been particularly clear in the case of the police, who have had huge support inthe Assembly. The Mayor has had huge support in the development of the police budget and its activities. It does not go down well with Assembly Members if they are characterised as voting against that when it is not the case.</p>

For instance, he will be as familiar as I am with the issue of whether it is necessary to put an amount on the Transport for London budget which gives rise to a precept when there are arguments about whether that is what Londoners want. I do not dispute that a very large part of what has been raised by the precept and a large part of what is spent as a result of government grant is a matter for the MPA budget. I will talk to the Minister outside Committee about that.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000056"></a>In saying that the Mayor is required to respond to the Assembly&#146;s amendments to the first draft budget, I realise that I have supported the noble Baroness&#146;s case more than I intended to. I should have added that the reasons given can be rather dismissive.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000057"></a>The Minister also said that there are implications for other authorities. This is not the place to argue about the comparative arrangements, but my understanding is that in boroughs with a strong leader model the council&#146;s authority is completely different from that of the Assembly. What we have in London is sui generis.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000058"></a>The Minister also said that, because the Assembly will have its own budget&#151;as it will after this Bill is enacted&#151;that will assist the matter. I do not believe that that is an issue for this amendment. People see the Assembly as a check on the Mayor. They are not hugely concerned about the Assembly&#146;s own budget, unless somebody accuses it of being profligate, which can happen, but that is not the heart of the issue.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Harris, said that I based my argument on the current incumbent not being a subtle person. I do not row back from that comment, but it is not the basis of my argument. I had hoped that I had explained that a recasting of the arrangement&#151;and I accept that it would be such&#151;would still leave a strong Mayor, because he would have executive powers. Indeed, it would be a greater challenge to the Assembly than combining to defeat the budget, because the Assembly would require 50 per cent plus to agree an alternative budget. I have always thought that that was the hardest barrier to overcome.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000060"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, talked about how the Mayor spends his money. Another very considerable frustration is that the Assembly is not able to deal with the budget line by line. That explains why this amendment was tabled but it is not a partof it.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000066"></a>The noble Lord said: As we enter a wider debate about the Assembly&#146;s budget, Amendment No. 28 relates to a fairly small, specific point about the budget of the London Transport Users&#146; Committee. We tabled this amendment to urge that, when the budget is set, appropriate regard is given to the requirements of that committee.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000067"></a>London TravelWatch plays a fundamental role. Transport issues are very rarely far from the thoughts of Londoners. The speed and, in particular, the reliability of the capital&#146;s transport network regularly preoccupy  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>users. London TravelWatch is an invaluable watchdog: it tackles those concerns effectively and persuasively on top of its function of resolving customer service complaints.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000068"></a>It is essential to have an effective body for addressing problems related to security and safety on public transport. No one would want to deny it sufficient funds. My honourable friend in another place Michael Gove, who has already been mentioned today, raised the shocking examples of the murder of Tom ap Rhys Pryce and the 2005 Tube bombings. The recent publicity surrounding the sentencing of the so-called Kensal Green Gang has further illustrated the level of fear that London&#146;s transport users have about the rise in violent crime.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000069"></a>For all those reasons, transport matters have been brought to the fore. London TravelWatch has become ever more active, and we believe that concern over travel safety and transport reliability will only increase. It is therefore essential that there is a mechanism to allow the people of London to voice their fears and complaints, knowing that they will be heard. We believe that the resources required to keep this service effective may well increase. This amendment would ensure that this important vehicle continues to receive the funding that it merits. It would be a great reassurance to know that it will continue.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000070"></a>As well as ensuring funding for the London Transport Users&#146; Committee, the amendment has an important second part. It seeks to ensure that London TravelWatch does not receive its resources at the expense of the Assembly and its important scrutiny function, which we have just discussed&#151;not least on transport. It would be wrong not to have regard also to the Assembly&#146;s needs.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000071"></a>I hope that the Government will accept this small amendment. Although transport is not one of the main areas of focus in the Bill, as I have said before, it affects Londoners every single day. If the Government accepted the amendment, they would show willingness to take fully into account the views of the public on important transport issues. Following the Minister&#146;s rather lukewarm response to earlier debates about consultation, it would send out an unfavourable message if the Government resisted this sort of amendment, which would improve democratic participation in our capital. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000072"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07050260000190"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I support the amendment. It concerns a matter discussed by the Assembly; its Members would unanimously support it.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000073"></a>I understand that the original intention was that London TravelWatch, as the London Transport Users&#146; Committee is now branded, should fall within the Assembly&#146;s budget because, if you have to choose between executive and scrutiny, it falls within the scrutiny part of the picture. However, it has a very different role and, as the noble Lord said, if it reduced the Assembly&#146;s scrutiny budget, that would be a problem. I am not wholly sure that I should like to see the Mayor setting the LTUC budget, so, if the principle of the amendment were accepted, I would want to see it followed by a further amendment dealing with how the budget is set. However, I understand the principle behind it.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000074"></a>The Minister in the Commons made the secondary point that the amendment was technically flawed. I can understand the words that he used&#151;he mentioned the chief finance officer&#146;s power of direction being intended to deal only with the Mayor&#146;s aspect of the budget&#151;but I cannot reconcile what he said withthe amendment or where it comes within the Bill. If there is a technical flaw, I hope that the Minister will explain it.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000075"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07050260000191"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I agree with what the noble Lord said about the importance of the function that London TravelWatch performs and how important safety is to all Londoners who use public transport, but I am afraid that I will have to disappoint him on the first part of his argument. I shall also try to address the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Members of the Committee have become a consolidated opposition, rather like the budget.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000076"></a>First, the noble Lord argued that we should ensure that the budget of the LTUC was adequate, protected, and so on, but it is not for the Government but the Assembly to do that. I am sure that the Mayor will listen to the suggestion that he sets that budget as well&#151;a seventh component budget, perhaps. The second argument is that an increase could adversely affect the budgetary ceiling of the Assembly and how it might increase its budget. That is the argument that I can address, explaining why it is technically problematic. I do not believe that it is a significant issue.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000077"></a>Clause 13 inserts into Schedule 6 to the Greater London Authority Act 1999 new paragraph 5A(9), allowing the GLA&#146;s chief finance officer to direct that specific amounts should be left out of the calculation for determining the ceiling beyond which the Assembly cannot amend its own budget. That is intended to deal with unusual, one-off, occasional items that would distort the Mayor&#146;s budget. Obviously, the Olympic precept is the best example.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000078"></a>The London Transport Users&#146; Committee does not come into that category, for obvious reasons. Placing a duty on the chief finance officer to have regard to the functions of the Assembly and the LTUC in issuing a direction relating to the Mayor&#146;s budget would have no bearing on its content. That is the explanation that I hope the noble Baroness was seeking.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000079"></a>In any event, I do not believe that one should be too exercised about this. Under Clause 12, the LTUC budget forms part of the Assembly&#146;s component budget, but it is a small proportion of the overall budget&#151;less than 20 per cent. Any changes in the LTUC&#146;s budget requirement are unlikely to have a significant bearing on the overall budget for the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000080"></a>In addition, if any of the LTUC&#146;s statutory duties changed, we would need primary legislation. For example, if it were to take on additional functions, which would imply a bigger budget, primary legislation would be needed to accomplish that. In that case, it would be appropriate to consider funding issues at the same time as the legislation was debated.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000081"></a>For those reasons, disappointed though the noble Lord probably is, I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I do not think the amendment would have been tabled were there not the fear that things might not work out properly.

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000083"></a>I am disappointed at the latter part of the Minister&#146;s argument. I always find that, where there is a will to do something, there is usually a way to do it. I know that it is a small issue, but I repeat that it is very important to Londoners. I am disappointed with the arguments, but I note what the Minister has said. We shall probably come back to the matter. I shall read what she has said and think about it, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000086"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 30 to 35. The amendments deal with the Assembly's budget. I put on record my appreciation that the Government have acknowledged the need for particular arrangements for the Assembly. They did so some time ago. The Government said that the Assembly would be able to set its own budget. The Mayor also said that that was quite right and that no Mayor should be able to meddle with the Assembly's budget.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000087"></a>I have acknowledged before now that the current Mayor has been generous in his allocation of staffing to the Assembly, but it is entirely possible that a future Mayor or the current Mayor in a less good mood&#151;I do not want to personalise the issue&#151;might constrain the Assembly's ability to scrutinise his actions and hold him to account. It is extremely important that the  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC69"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC69</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scrutiny arm should not be constrained through such a sledgehammer approach. The Government have included important protections for the Assembly's budget, but they are not enough. A separate component budget for the Assembly needs a little tweaking.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000088"></a>The Minister spoke earlier about the ability to vote on separate components. I had not taken that into account in these amendments. I hope that we will be able to relate that point to the Assembly's budget as well as the overall issue.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000089"></a>Amendment Nos. 29, 31 and 33 deal with the same issue but at different stages or under different circumstances. As the Minister said, the Bill sets a ceiling so that the Assembly budget cannot rise by a greater proportion than the Mayor's budget. For that purpose, the Mayor's budget is everything but the Assembly budget. I do not argue with that, but it does not address the issue of protection. The amendments would set a floor so that the Assembly budget is not subject to unlimited cuts if the new Mayor&#146;s budget&#151;that must be what &#147;NM&#148; means, and &#147;OM&#148; means old Mayor&#151;is greater than the old Mayor&#146;s budget&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07050260000090"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07050260000194"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> The old mare.</p>

Perhaps we should have used &#147;PM&#148;, for previous Mayor. The minimum Assembly budget would reflect that change. If the new Mayor&#146;s budget&#151;I have lost my place thanks to the helpful intervention on the acronyms.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000092"></a>If the new Mayor&#146;s budget is less than the older Mayor&#146;s budget then the Assembly budget would be reduced in proportion. If they are the same, the Assembly budget would be the same.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000093"></a>Will the Committee consider the position not only on a single year but in the context of the cumulative effect of mayoral cuts or a standstill of the Assembly budget compared with an increased mayoral budget over a period of years? The amendments are not about Assembly profligacy. The Assembly is not profligate. It recently decided not to go for an extra post in the budget, which would have related to scrutinising new mayoral powers, because it is not likely to be needed as soon as was once thought. The amendments are about protecting the scrutiny function. As I have said, that is not the case so far in London.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000094"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07050260000196"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Can the noble Baroness point to anywhere else within the system whereby budgets are protected in this way in local government? I had always thought that local authorities were free to cut budgets if they wanted to. She is seeking to establish a system that would protect in law the whole area of expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000095"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07050260000197"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> That is right because, as I said on a previous amendment, this arrangement is sui generis.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000096"></a>I have been struck by the fact that some local authorities have given almost no resource to the scrutiny function. For example, an overview and scrutiny committee may be supported by half an officer who spends the other half of his time supporting the executive.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000097"></a>I am not seeking to protect a part of the budget, other than proportionately to the Mayor&#146;s budget. If the Mayor reduces his budget by 50 per cent, the Assembly&#146;s budget would be reduced by that, but not more than that. The amendment would set a floor to ensure that the Assembly&#146;s statutory duty of holding the Mayor or the Executive to account was not prejudiced by the Executive cutting the budget disproportionately. It should be there to support that function. I agree that the provision is not something that one has come across before, but one has not come across something like the GLA before. The whole thing is entirely new. I hope that that is of some help.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000098"></a>The Mayor has said that such an amendment would put the Assembly on a privileged footing compared with the functional bodies, but that is not an appropriate comparison. The functional bodies are an arm of the Executive. As I said, this is about delivering the scrutiny function. The noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, is not in her place, but London First accepts and supports applying a floor as protection. Members of the Assembly, of all political parties, also support it.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000099"></a>In a letter to noble Lords following Second Reading, the Minister said that if a Mayor set an excessively low budget, the Assembly would readily muster two thirds to amend the Mayor's proposal, but that is not my understanding of what the Assembly can do. That takes me to Amendments Nos. 30, 32, and 34 in which I propose that the Assembly needs to be in full control of its own budget, subject to a ceiling, and that that must apply through all stages of the budget-making process.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000100"></a>We have returned to the matter of voting on separate components of the budget, which we may need to discuss further before Report. As the Assembly has understood it, it cannot effectively vote on the separate components. It has historically taken votes to show that it has, for instance, supported the police budget but not a transport budget. Still less can it vote on a line-by-line basis for particular projects. It has to vote at the very last stage for the total amount of the Mayor's budget. By making the Assembly budget a sixth component, without this amendment, the Assembly would not be able to vote separately on it. If, at the last stage, the Mayor put forward an Assembly budget that was unacceptable to the Assembly, its option would be to vote against the whole budget. There are often political reasons why that is not an acceptable way forward. In any event, it would be ineffective because it would only change the total amount of the Mayor's budget not the component parts. It would be up to the Mayor to reallocate. The other option would be to vote for the Mayor's budget because of the political perceptions.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000101"></a>The Minister has said that to have a different arrangement for the sixth component would be inconsistent, but consistency does not always mean that the overall aim is achieved. The amendments would be consistent with the objectives of ensuring that the Assembly can set its own budget. Again, the amendments are supported by London First.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000102"></a>Amendment No. 35, the third limb of these mechanisms, builds on the government proposals and would enable the Assembly to allocate resources within its budget. Without that, I fear that the Mayor could make the decisions and, for example, alter the amount that is devoted to the Assembly&#146;s scrutiny programme or given to the party groups. I do not suggest favouring or disfavouring particular groups, because that might well attract challenges, but it would allow the Mayor to control the allocation within the budget.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000103"></a>In the Commons the Minister said that this amendment was not necessary. He referred to Section 34 of the 1999 Act, which says that the powers of the authority can be exercised by the Mayor, the Assembly or both acting together. That does not seem to help us in this case. If the Government are relying on that, perhaps the Minister will explain it. I beg to move.</p>

As the debate has gone on, I have become more and more confused, and I hope that the Minister will clarify matters.

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000105"></a>I am going to depart from my notes because I want to clarify one or two points. We have talked about the Assembly having scrutiny powers, but it seems obvious that it should have the right kind of budget to carry out its scrutiny function. The Assembly is the right body to do that but it has to have some protection. As I understand it, there is no floor to the budget, as has been the subject of our discussion. The Assembly should be able to create a budget that is protected in some way, and I should like assurance on that point.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000106"></a>We have talked a lot about scrutiny. If we have a strong mayoral model, the Assembly must have a strong scrutiny function and powers to create its budget, but that does not seem to be the case. We seem to have got confused regarding agreeing budgets line by line, and so on. We are giving a lot of extra power to the Mayor so that he is a strong Mayor, but we need to give equivalent power to the Assembly so that it can carry out the scrutiny. The amendment seeks to clarify that.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000107"></a>This matter will clearly be the subject of debate not just in Committee but throughout the passage of this legislation. We need to understand it so that we know what amendments to put forward, or even to vote on, at later stages to ensure that the Assembly has enough scrutiny powers.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000108"></a>I am concerned that we are not considering the matter sufficiently. The Assembly is elected on the same day as the Mayor and therefore it has a political mandate. Even if its Members are not from the same political party as the Mayor or the majority are not from the same party, they are still elected on the same day. The people of London will have voted for them and I am sure that they will want to see the checks and balances created by the Mayor. It might be sensible to insist that they are all from the same party,

As leader of Essex County Council, I propose a budget that has to be scrutinised and passed by the full council. The leader and the Cabinet have no power to implement that&#151;all 75 members of Essex County Council have to debate and pass the budget. That does not happen in London although there is a strong Mayor model. I will be interested to see what happens in the forthcoming local government Bill. Will I, as leader of Essex County Council, have the power of veto over the county council? We will talk about that when we debate that legislation.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000115"></a>Let us have some more clarity; when we know where we are and how the Assembly can protect its budget, we can debate it properly. I am getting more and more confused about how the Assembly can function in London.</p>

I gather from the briefing I have had from the Mayor&#146;s Office that he supports the Bill as it stands, which gives the Assembly greater powers of scrutiny. However, parts of the amendments undermine to some degree the powers that the Mayor already has; we have had some discussion about that in the context of my noble friend Lord Harris&#146;s contribution. There is a move here to transform the Assembly into a Greater London Council, which it is not. It is not the GLC but an Assembly with scrutiny powers. I can see no real reason for departing from the wording in the Bill. I would be grateful to know if the Minister can see any reason; I can see none except an attempt to undermine to some degree the powers that the Mayor already has. Although we may have different views of what the government of London ought to be, we are all agreed

We have a Mayor with substantial powers, and everybody seems to agree with that. Therefore, there is no reason to support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000117"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07050260000206"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This has been a lively debate. I will not follow the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, through the detailed way in which she presented her arguments. It is probably better that I do what I was invited to do by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and address some simple political realities. I am grateful for the contributions of my noble friends Lady Turner and Lord Campbell-Savours. They raised issues which are contextually germane to what we are proposing.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000118"></a>I believe that noble Lords have erected fears which are unfounded. The strategy they propose runs greater risks than does accepting what we are trying to do, not only by inventing a budget for the Assembly. The underlying fear is that the Mayor might, in the face of argument or criticism, reduce and diminish the power of the Assembly by cutting the budget. I am not convinced that there need be any additional statutory safeguards; the normal democratic processes are there to do just that. Creating an Assembly budget which then can be promoted and defended gives the Assembly a new and unique ability to do that.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000119"></a>Let me deal first with the Assembly component budget and the simple majority question. Amendments Nos. 30 and 32 specifically allow the Assembly to amend by simple majority only its own final draft budget. To pick up a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, there is no basis in legislation, as I said earlier, for the Assembly to vote against the Mayor&#146;s budget as a whole. It must approve the final draft, with or without amendment.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000120"></a>I have three arguments. The first is to do with inconsistency, and I do not think it is frivolous; the second is to do with the reputation and function of the Assembly; and the third is to do with the realpolitik of what it means to operate in a democratic environment. It does not make sense for the Assembly to be allowed to amend one part of the final budget through a simple-majority vote while the rest of the consolidated budget requires a two-thirds majority for amendment, even if that part is about the Assembly&#146;s own budget. That takes us to the question of reputation. It would send a curious and unconfident signal if the first thing the Assembly did on getting its own independent budget was to try to secure preferential treatment to ensure that it is more protected and easier to increase than budgets for GLA front-line services. The noble Baroness said that that would not be so, but I believe the perception of Londoners would be that neighbourhood police forces are less important and have less political salience than the administration of the Assembly or that the fire service counts for less than securing more staffing for Assembly Members. I would not feel comfortable sending that message.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000121"></a>The second risk, which is related to the first, relates to reputation and realpolitik. For the first time, Assembly Members will have a strong common interest in ensuring that the Assembly has the resources necessary to fulfil its functions. This is the point raised by the question of  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scrutiny. On the first day in Committee, we discussed how the scrutiny powers of the Assembly are enhanced by requiring the Mayor to explain to it in new ways why he had taken certain decisions. For the first time, the Assembly will have the resources necessary to fulfil its functions effectively and, together with the additional powers on confirmation hearings and staffing, it will be able to hold the Mayor to account on behalf of Londoners. This is a different state of affairs. It will be far easier for the Assembly to achieve a consensus on its own budget against a Mayor who proposes an excessively low budget than it is at the moment, when it has to try to reach consensus on policy issues. If it did not do that, I would think that there was something seriously wrong with the political organisation of the parties involved.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000122"></a>Amendments Nos. 21, 31 and 33 set the minimum amount. The same arguments apply in part. The amendments provide the Assembly with additional and preferential safeguards in its budget rather than ensuring that the existing arrangements, whereby it can amend its final draft budget by a two-thirds majority, work well. I find this a rather alarmist scenario. I do not say that it is typical of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, but the expectation that something cannot be achieved within the present arrangements is strange because the two-thirds rule provides a sufficient safeguard to enable the Assembly to amend an excessively low budget proposed by the Mayor. As the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, implied, rather than establishing a complex and arbitrary mechanism to guarantee a minimum budget, the Assembly should have confidence in itself and use its existing powers and the powers of persuasion between parties to command a majority that ensures a fair and equitable budget.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000123"></a>We are having architectural arguments about ceilings and floors. I do not think it is inconsistent to have a ceiling and no floor. A ceiling is important because it would look very odd to give the Assembly carte blanche to increase its own budget unacceptably, but a floor anticipates a profound lack of trust between the Assembly and the Mayor and a lack of self-confidence in the Assembly. It sends a seriously uncomfortable and probably inappropriate message that the Assembly budget is more worthy of extra protection than the budgets of front-line services. It is a very cumbersome and complicated way to protect the Assembly. It adds more layers of complexity to an already complex process.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000124"></a>I shall not repeat my response to the argument that, without a budgetary floor, the Assembly would suffer a death by 1,000 cuts. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would not have its intended effect. The calculation it proposes would allow the Mayor to freeze the budget&#151;a cut in real terms&#151;and increase his own budget. That would not protect the Assembly from cumulative cuts.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000125"></a>AmendmentNo. 35 makes explicit that the Assembly can allocate money as it sees fit from within its own agreed budget. The amendment is not necessary, given the spirit and the letter of the law. It is clearly within the spirit of the Bill that the Assembly should decide how best to allocate its budget within the agreed total of that budget, regardless of whether or not it had

Section 34 of the GLA Act 1999, which enables the Assembly to do anything that is incidental to the exercise of its functions, provides the legal basis for the Assembly to take such decisions.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000126"></a>The point raised by the noble Baroness in her amendment is covered. I hope that noble Lords will not press their amendments.</p>

I apologise to noble Lords that I have not made the process more like a stocking stitch. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, asked why, if there was no budgetary floor in Essex County Council, there should be one in London. Conversely, if it is wrong in London, it may be wrong in Essex also and we should look at changing the arrangements for Essex.</p>

On two occasions she said that that was news to her. That would be an immeasurable power in discussions over scrutiny budgets. I would have thought that her group and the Conservative group in the authority would wish to look very closely at my noble friend&#146;s undertaking. If I were a member of the GLA and that power were available to me, I would feel assured that I could obtain whatever money I needed for scrutiny.</p>

However, there is some history to this issue, which has been of concern to the Assembly. I am not saying that the Assembly and its advisers have never thought about or looked at this matter, but I want to be absolutely sure about it. I believe that I am right to say that, whatever assurances the Minister may give from the Dispatch Box, although welcome, if they can be challenged afterwards on the basis of the wording of the legislation, they would, sadly, not count.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050260000130"></a>The position of Essex and all other local authorities is not the same as that of London. Even with a Cabinet model, there is a leader and a Cabinet drawn from the whole council and the council has control of the whole budget. That is not the case in London. The noble Baroness, Lady Turner, characterised the amendment as rewording the Bill. That is not the intention; the intention is to provide additions. That may sound a tedious point, but it is important. Nor is the amendment aimed at undermining the structure and constitutional arrangements or at turning the Assembly into a GLC mark II. It aims to ensure that the Assembly is in control of that one bit of the budget. That is what the Government said, at the start of the process, they sought to achieve. Despite their length, these are intended to be technical amendments to achieve what the Government say they are tryingto do.</p>

<p><a name="07050260000131"></a>The Minister talked about reducing the Mayor&#146;s powers. The amendments would not do that, except to the extent that the Mayor would have a power, as we believe, to reduce the Assembly&#146;s budget subject to a cap but not to a minimum, or a floor.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000010"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 38. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has Amendment No. 73 in this group as well. The Mayor already has powers to issue directions to the London Development Agency and Transport for London; these are to be extended to the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, to which the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment refers. My amendment relates to directions to all the functional bodies. The principal amendment is AmendmentNo. 38, which would enable the Assembly to call in directions.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000011"></a>The amendment is not tantamount to a veto. It is proposed that, when the Mayor issues a direction, the Assembly should have an opportunity to require the Mayor to take account of any recommendations made by it within a period of three weeks and to justify why he does not&#151;in other words, it creates a pause.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000012"></a>This is not new in local government&#151;indeed, quite the contrary. In local authorities, the executive have to publish forward plans and there is a right to call in odd decisions, but neither applies in the case of the Greater London Authority. The amendments are about openness and about the Mayor justifying his proposals and that is what scrutiny should be about.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000013"></a>The point of difference between my noble friends and me and perhaps the Minister&#151;but certainly between Assembly members and the Mayor&#151;is whether scrutiny should always be in arrears or whether it can take place in advance of an action. I do not believe that scrutiny should be confined to occurring after an event. The Assembly could not block the Mayor but would simply ask him to explain himself.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000014"></a>The Minister said that the 21-day period in Amendment No. 38 would gravely hinder the Mayor, leaving him unable to act quickly and decisively. But it is hard to think of a direction that might come out of the blue and mean that the 21-day period would be of such importance. For a direction to be issued, one would expect the functional body&#151;the fire authority or the development agency&#151;to have considered the  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue, because it would be odd if the Mayor issued a direction without knowing that there was a conflict with the functional body. Therefore, it should not be the dramatic cliff-hanger that the Minister suggested. I understand that, so far, there has been an average of about five directions a year. Given that the whole constitution is about checks and balances, this would be a check not in the sense of a stop but of a pause. The Assembly considered this amendment as a proposal and agreed it nem con.</p>

She referred to five directions a year. Can she give us a particular example?</p>

As I said on the last group of amendments, our job here is to think through the &#147;what ifs?&#148;, not to start from the point that the Assembly would be utterly difficult or would block the Mayor. This is not about blocking but about an explanation. It is not an answer to these amendments to say that the Assembly would have used this on a matter in the past. In a well functioning authority, this sort of thing would be such a last resort that one would not want to see it used. I take the noble Lord&#146;s point that it might be helpful to have an example. However, the fact that my brain is not working fast enough should not undermine my amendment in the way that he might imply.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000017"></a>The first of my two amendments deals with what would be counted as a direction for this purpose. We are all accustomed to the different levels of diktats. In different levels of government, they are suggestions and guidance at one end and gentle encouragement at the other. The amendment would extend the term &#147;directions&#148; to include not only specific directions about particular decisions by the functional bodies but also general directions about how each body might act and guidance about the way it exercises its functions. I beg to move.</p>

It is very similar to those moved by the noble Baroness but it refers to the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. Our amendment continues the arguments that have been used by the noble Baroness and I do not need to go into them in much detail. However, it again underlines the debate that we are having about increasing the Assembly's ability to scrutinise the Mayor's powers and introducing greater transparency into the decision-making process.</p>

It mirrors existing powers for Transport for London and the London Development Agency, and the amendment would not remove those powers. It would also respect the primacy of the Mayor in the event of an unresolved dispute. However, it would represent a significant shift in favour of openness and accountability. It would allow the Assembly to make

The Mayor could choose to ignore the Assembly&#146;s suggestions but there would be an opportunity for some degree of scrutiny or consideration of the directions. It is desirable that there should be an opportunity to scrutinise these directions&#151;even if they are limited in number&#151;before they take effect rather than, as the noble Baroness has said, simply retrospectively. The Mayor is frightened of extra scrutiny, as any Mayor in London would be.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000020"></a>I am interested to hear what argument is advanced against this amendment and against those tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. As the noble Baroness said, many local authorities already have similar powers. The Mayor has used his power to issue directions to Transport for London and the London Development Agency only very sparingly; I think the noble Baroness said that he had done so five times. This power would therefore not be widely used. However, as the directions are not numerous, they presumably have some significance when issued. Given the nature of the cases, there would be some merit in having accountability, at least to the point that the Mayor is likely to have to justify openly why his direction is being made.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000021"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07050276000363"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> In moving the amendment, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that it was not a veto. Amendments Nos. 38 and 73 both state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050276000292"></a>&#147;The Mayor shall have regard to any recommendation made by the Assembly under subsection (3) above&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000266"></a>But subsection (3) in the amendment states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050276000293"></a>&#147;The Assembly may within 21 days ... recommend that the proposed direction should not be issued&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000267"></a>The amendment also states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050276000294"></a>&#147;The Mayor shall have regard to any recommendation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000268"></a>That seems to come very close to being a veto.</p>

It shows that this is, once again, a variation on the debate about the balance of power between the Mayor and the Assembly and the threat that it poses to the successful model that we have of a strong executive Mayor with an Assembly holding him to account. It will come as no surprise to the noble Baroness that I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000023"></a>Amendment No. 38 would require the Mayor to send to the Assembly any direction or guidance that he intends to issue. It would allow the Assembly to recommend to the Mayor within 21 days of receiving the proposed direction that he should not issue it, or should issue it with amendments. That sounds very much like a veto. It also imposes a duty on the Mayor to have regard to the Assembly&#146;s recommendations and, within 21 days of receiving them, to prepare a statement setting out his reasons why any of the recommendations are not accepted.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000024"></a>Amendment No. 73 makes a similar provision in respect of any directions issued by the Mayor under the GLA Act to the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. The Committee will be aware that the GLA Bill includes a provision at Clause 27 to give the Mayor a power of direction over the LFEPA. We shall come to that in due course.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000025"></a>Amendment No. 78 defines a direction given bythe Mayor to include any general and specific directions&#151;again, a much wider power&#151;or guidance issued by the Mayor to any body on the exercise of its functions.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000026"></a>These directions may be few but they are among the most important levers available to the Mayor to ensure that priorities and objectives set out in his strategy are implemented. They are the levers of change; that is what makes them so important. It is only right that the Assembly should be able to scrutinise the Mayor&#146;s decision to issue a direction, but the difference between giving a retrospective power with a requirement to explain and the power to withdraw the direction is serious.</p>
<h5><a name="07050276000350"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000027"></a>The power to issue directions and guidance is part and parcel of the Mayor&#146;s oversight of the functional bodies for which he is accountable, and it is crucial that the Mayor should be able to act quickly and decisively when necessary to issue directions and guidance to functional bodies about their performance and actions. Requiring the Mayor to wait up to 21 days for the Assembly to make its recommendations on his proposed direction would prevent him issuing urgent, or even timely, directions, and it could risk a hiatus of several weeks before the body receiving a mayoral direction became clear about what that direction included.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000028"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours for asking the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for examples. Disappointingly, she was not able to provide an example, but I can provide some of how it would harm the process. The current Mayor has already issued time-critical directions providing legal certainty to functional bodies that they can undertake particular urgent activities&#151;for example, to TfL and the LDA in relation to Olympic preparations. It is possible that a future Mayor would want to act quickly and decisively through the use of directions immediately after being elected in order to implement his manifesto commitments&#151;for example, in relation to public transport fares.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000029"></a>Furthermore, the introduction of a 21-day period for Assembly consideration would affect the Mayor&#146;s ability to use his limited powers of direction over boroughs, which are often time-critical. In particular, the amendments would cut right across the Mayor&#146;s current power to direct a borough to refuse a strategically important planning application&#151;a matter that we are all looking forward to debating next week. As under the existing Mayor of London order 2000, the Mayor has only 14 days to issue a direction of refusal to the borough, so these amendments would effectively make this power of direction unworkable. Similarly, the Mayor has only a limited window of opportunity to issue a direction to boroughs in relation to their waste

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000030"></a>Finally, the Assembly already has ample opportunity and means through its existing scrutiny powers to scrutinise, retrospectively, any directions or guidance issued by the Mayor. Indeed, there arewell established mechanisms that support that; it is the best form of effective scrutiny. However well intentioned, what the amendments present us with would fundamentally alter the balance of powers in the GLA&#151;a balance that at the moment creates the opportunity for the Mayor to act decisively for the benefit of Londoners. It would fetter that discretion, and that would be to the detriment of London as a whole. I hope the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

If those words amount to a veto, does that mean that the Assembly has a veto over the strategy under new Section 42A of the Act, under which the Mayor must consult the Assembly about his proposed strategies and &#147;have regard to&#148; any comments submitted by the Assembly? We debated that as a specific amendment. The Government cannot have one interpretation of &#147;have regard to&#148; under that clause and another under this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000032"></a>I thought that I had substantially dealt with the issue of the 21-day period before, but the Minister gave us examples, including the period of 21 days for the Olympics.

<p><a name="07050276000038"></a>The noble Lord said: The eyes of the world will be on London when the London Olympics take place in 2012. The Mayor, whoever he or she may be after the 2008 elections, is likely to follow a pattern, already established and typical in any mayoral system, of having a number of advisers who are part of a team. Should the incumbent lose after the elections in May 2012, shortly before the Olympics, this could disrupt preparation for the Games and that team would inevitably move on if there were a change in the person holding the mayoral post.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000039"></a>The need to run for re-election would be a damaging distraction for the incumbent fromthe energies that are needed to make a success of the Games. With the upheaval to the capital in the approach to the Olympics, a mayoral election would be an inconvenience, causing unhelpful disruption to London in addition to expected inconveniences associated with preparing for the Games.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000040"></a>All Greater London Authority members and political parties should be focused on working together to ensure that the London Olympics are the best possible advert for the city and the country. A divisive election campaign only months before the Games would be counter-productive to this objective.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000041"></a>The new clause is entirely outside party politics; the success of the Games will be important for the United Kingdom&#146;s international reputation. With a partisan election, it is inevitable that the Mayor will be distracted with the election taking place just before the Olympics. There is the prospect of a great deal of distraction from the important attention that the Mayor should give the Olympic Games. I beg to move.</p>

I was a member of the GLC when the elections were deferred last time, and I am not sure that it did not create a lot of confusion. If it is a question of altering the date, perhaps it should be earlier rather than later. It is an interesting proposal but it needs to be given a lot more thought.</p>

In fact, it is so interesting that I think it was raised&#151;and, at one stage, had a degree of government support&#151;when it was first proposed that London should bid for the Olympics. It was recognised that the potential disruptive effect of a mayoral election a matter of weeks before the Olympics would not be entirely helpful to a successful event.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000044"></a>I am not sure that I support the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, about the coterie of advisers who will surround the Mayor in office at the time and the deleterious effect of some of them disappearing. I do not believe that that would be the critical factor. The critical factor will be that the ODA and LOCOG, which are already in place, will have permanent people acting for them and that will not necessarily be subject to a change of Mayor.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000046"></a>It would be unhelpful to have an election a few weeks before the Games. I can see the attractions of the noble Baroness&#146;s suggestion of bringing it forward or putting it back a year but, whatever change is made, it is important to indicate clearly that the normal cycle of elections would then revert to the one that started in 2000 and continued in 2004 and 2008. This would simply be a blip to recognise a unique event in the life of this city&#151;the Olympic Games&#151;and the fact that a distraction involving an election in that period would not be entirely helpful.</p>

I am not quite as cynical as my noble friend Lord Harris. I welcome the call that the noble Lord has made for all parties to work together over the Olympics. I am sure that we shall see that, because it will clearly be an opportunity to showcase and highlight London, and there will also be the regeneration work, as well as our heritage and cosmopolitan culture. It will be an extremely important event. However, I am afraid that it is not sufficiently exceptional to postpone the 2012 mayoral elections by a year to ensure continuity.</p>

I appreciate that it was regarded as a major event in the countryside but, for most Londoners, it was probably something that passed them by. How can my noble friend suggest that the Olympic Games is a minor issue?</p>

I certainly did not say that the Olympic Games was a minor issue. It was the only example that I could think of, although there was also the foot and mouth outbreak. However, we can all put forward our own candidates; for example, 2012 is the Handel tercentenary and that would be a very good reason for postponing the elections but, again, it is hardly a sufficient argument for interfering in such an important part of the democratic process. It would undermine a fundamental constitutional principle in the original GLA Act that the Mayor&#146;s political legitimacy is derived from direct regular elections held every four years. We had the beginnings of a discussion about that yesterday. While a potential change of Mayor in May 2012 might be a complicating factor, we cannot consider it as a major risk to the games.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000050"></a>In all seriousness, the proposal would also set a dubious precedent. The foot and mouth example followed from a genuine national emergency and there was no argument for different parts of the country voting on different days. On the basis of that argument, a case could be made for saying that other major sporting events should also trigger such a change, but that simply would not make sense.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000051"></a>There is one other argument. There would be increasing concerns about the political legitimacy of the Mayor&#151;whoever is elected in 2008&#151;towards the end of his five-year term in 2013, especially if he took forward new policies in areas not directly related to the Olympics. There would be a disjunction that would cause some confusion in the political environment and it might even lead to a loss of confidence in the Mayor. So, with regret, I must tell the noble Lord that we cannot accept his amendment and I hope that he finds it possible to withdraw it.</p>

I think that there were some extravagant gestures then. The more I listen to the debate, the more worried I become, or possibly the more amused&#151;I am not sure which. Elections have been moved for different reasons&#151;the foot and mouth disease outbreak was one. They have been moved to occur on the same day as other elections, which happened with the Euro elections. Somewhere in my head there is another example, which I cannot quite grasp.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000053"></a>This will be an exceptional event; we shall never get the Olympic Games again&#151;at least not for a very long time. The last time was 1948. We should be able to plan, and not leave it until the last minute. An awful lot of people of the few who have thought about this&#151;the political chattering classes&#151;expect that the Government will decide quite close to the event that they will have to postpone the election. That would be a bad thing. It is far better to be straight about it and plan for it now.</p>

My noble friend&#146;s suggestion that there will be a strange period in the fifth year when legitimacy will drain away is altered by the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, has had the sense to bring the issue forward in advance of the elections in 2008, so that the people of London will know the terms on which they are electing a Mayor at that time. I expect that the people of London could easily judge that they had been asked to elect someone for a five-year term as opposed to a four-year term&#151;or indeed, for three years, if an alternative was proposed.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000055"></a>The situation regarding the changing date for the GLC was slightly different; that was in the run-up to abolition, when the behaviour of politicians is slightly different from their behaviour just before an election that has been scheduled but is simply deferred.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000059"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would introduce a new clause to provide for the vacation of the office of Mayor following a petition. Earlier, we moved an amendment to limit the number of terms for the Mayor, but we are now moving on a bit. It is not an alternative to, but another of the ways of trying to ensure that the mayoral system in London has all the checks and balances that should be there.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000060"></a>Our rationale for limiting the time in office in the earlier amendment was founded on the lack of accountability that the Mayor faces in the four intervening years between each election, coupled with the powers that the Bill gives to this office.</p>

But it could be used in extremisif the Mayor did something that was of such importance to the electorate, or perhaps an extreme action triggered off a great deal of annoyance, irritation and concern. We should ensure that enough of the electorate signed the petition, so that the power could not be employed realistically unless there were clear grounds for doing so. Knowing how reluctant people in this country are to sign petitions, it would take a lot for them to do so. We recognise that, but we believe that it would enable some control overour Mayor&#146;s actions if it were deemed appropriate by the electorate. If that power were there, it would underline that the incumbent Mayor must have reason to continue to act in the public interest as far as possible.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000067"></a>The Minister may have identified flaws in the proposal for a two-term limit.

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000068"></a>It is essential that the Mayor knows that he can be judged on his performance between elections so that the electorate would have a voice if it felt strongly enough. As the 1999 Act and the Bill stand, there is no recall of the vote, even under a petition. It would be sensible as GLA powers expand&#151;each time a GLA Bill comes up, there is a bit more power in it. We hope that that restraint would be important to the electorate and the system under which the GLA operates. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000269"></a>I should have thought that 10 per cent of those who voted for the Mayor comes to only a few thousand. In other words, a handful of people in London with a petition would be able to remove the elected Mayor. Surely that is not what the noble Baroness intends; perhaps she would like to modify her amendment before it is debated further.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000272"></a>Assuming that it is a secret ballot, how will anyone know who voted for the Mayor and who voted against him?</p>

I am not particularly worried about the point that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has raised. The number of votes cast for candidates is declared and made public, so you divide that number by 10 and get 10 per cent. However, I am surprised that the amendment refers to setting a threshold at 10 per cent of those who voted for the Mayor. A 40 per cent turnout might mean that 2 million people voted. The amendment does not specify whether it is the first ballot vote for the Mayor or the second ballot vote; it simply talks about 10 per cent of those who vote for the Mayor. The number of people who cast their vote in the mayoral election might be a threshold but I argue that a 10 per cent threshold is rather low. In a tightly contested election, the losing candidate would have to persuade only slightly more than one-tenth of those who voted for him to sign a petition and the election would then be rerun. I am not sure that that would be in the interests of democracy in London.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000075"></a>Having said that, I think that there is some point to the noble Baroness&#146;s proposition. She cannot have it every way but she must be able to have it at least one way during these discussions. She has argued that the Mayor is in a unique position and that therefore a limit should be imposed on his term in office, he should be fettered by the Assembly in a way that was not envisaged in the original Act, or, as in this proposal, that a recall by the electorate should be possible. Because of the Mayor&#146;s powers and his unique personal role, I can see that there should be  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>checks and balances, and it is a matter for this Committee and for any wider review of the Greater London Authority to consider whether those checks and balances are precise.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000076"></a>I assume that, in summing up, the noble Baroness will tell us, first, that she does not intend all these constraints on the Mayor to operate&#151;that is, terms limits, much more power for the Assembly and a power of recall&#151;but, if she is arguing for a power of recall, I shall be very interested to hear her justification for the low threshold. It seems unacceptably low. If she had said, for example, that 25 per cent of the electorate should be required to sign a petition, I do not think that many of us would argue that that would be anything other than a substantial number which any wise Mayor would take seriously and recognise the need to renew his mandate. Again, particularly in the context of term limits, which we debated earlier, it is not at all apparent from the amendment whether a Mayor facing a recall petition could stand for re-election.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000077"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07050276000387"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I shall do my best to distinguish between principle and detail because there are issues relating to both. The debate on this amendment is very similar to the discussion that we had on the two-term limit. Again, we can look at the American parallel but we should do so with a very large dose of salt. In some ways, I think that it is rather dangerous to make such parallels.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000078"></a>It is important that democratic legitimacy is built into the Mayor&#146;s role and position, which ultimately derive from direct elections, and we should not do anything to dilute that. Indeed, his success in these elections, involving the whole London electorate, gives him his strong democratic mandate. We would be very unhappy about allowing a Mayor to be removed from office through a petition, as that would obviously undermine that principle.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000079"></a>The noble Baroness asked what could be done: she suggested that it should be possible to do something in situations of extremis between elections. Section 21 of the Greater London Authority Act provides for that. It states that a mayor can be disqualified if he is bankrupt, convicted of a criminal offence with imprisonment of not less than three months or disqualified for misconduct. Those are very powerful restraints on a mayor. However, being able to get rid of a mayor by a petition&#151;particularly, as noble Lords have pointed out, through the action of such a small proportion of Londoners who are unhappy with him&#151;would introduce enormous risk into the whole process.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000080"></a>Perhaps I may elucidate the figures that have been mentioned. The default threshold for the proposed petition is 10 per cent of the number of electors who voted for the Mayor. That is hardly a high hurdle: it would be 83,000 electors, based on the 2004 election results, out of a London electorate of 5.2 million. That figure stands comparison with the more than 90,000 Londoners who voted for the BNP in the last Assembly elections, so it is conceivable that a Mayor could be removed by extremists if the default threshold were adopted. This would be a dangerous precedent in terms of special interest groups, which, I believe, would

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000081"></a>The other problem, alluded to by my noble friend, is that a mayor removed from office would be able to stand again at a subsequent ballot, so there would be a continuous revolving door&#151;a time-consuming cycle of petition, by-election and petition&#151;which could turn the whole thing into a farce.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000082"></a>Finally, I am slightly surprised that the Opposition want the Secretary of State to determine the exact arrangements for a petition. That would give us the worst of all worlds, with a very low threshold and serious powers given to the Secretary of State to determine the process. I cannot believe that the noble Baroness wants such a strong lever over the Mayor, especially when the Government and the Mayor could be of different political persuasions. Clearly, a whole range of dangers is involved.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000083"></a>This has been an important debate in terms of checks and balances, but we cannot accept the amendment and I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

Today, even in the areas that have been criticised, we have discussed, as we needed to do, the principle of whether the Mayor, who is elected and is a figure of authority with power, should be subject to an additional check and balance. We discussed whether that might be done by a percentage of the electorate or a percentage of the people who vote in the election, and I accept the criticism in that regard.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000085"></a>However, there is a principle here that we may need to flesh out again more satisfactorily. There should be a trigger mechanism for someone to obtain the required number of signatures if the Mayor causes immense chagrin to a proportion of the electorate through a policy initiative. I do not underestimate the difficulty that that would involve. Although theNo. 10 website manages to attract a lot of names, people are generally extremely reluctant to sign anything, and I accept that there would have to be checks on that. But the principle behind this and my previous amendment concerning a limit on the term is that, during the passage of the Bill, we should be able to find a measure to ensure that the Mayor is subject to checks and balances from the electorate between elections.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000090"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to the Question whether Clause 18 shall stand part of the Bill, but I shall not move Amendment No. 41A, which was intended only as a probing amendment.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000091"></a>Amendment No. 41 relates to appointments to the board of Transport for London. To an extent, we welcome some of what the Government have sought to achieve in Clause 18. By removing the prohibition on holders of political office sitting on the board of Transport for London, the Bill will allow borough councillors on to the board. Given that councillors possess an extensive knowledge of, and play an important role in, local issues, we believe that this is an entirely sensible relaxation of the rules. However, this will remain a permissive power only, and we should like to see a specific provision included in Clause 18 that the Mayor must appoint borough representatives to the board of Transport for London, and that he must do so through London councils. It is essential that the boroughs play a part in the decision-making of TfL.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000092"></a>Of course, our preferred approach is to remove Clause 18 and replace it with the wording of Amendment No. 41. There must be a genuine balance of political representation on the board, and we want to give London councils the right to appoint seven of the 15 board members.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000093"></a>The proposed composition directly follows the model of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. Our concern is that the 1999 Act gave the Mayor almost unbridled power to appoint the individuals he wants&#151;a position not addressed by  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC91"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Cause 18. The inevitable upshot of this model is that the board is simply a tool of the Mayor. There is nothing to prevent the Mayor filling the TfL board with colleagues who share his political views, as indeed is currently the case. It would be naive to imagine that this practice would not oftenbe continued under future mayors of any political party.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000094"></a>Transport issues are unquestionably one of the authority's most important functions, as we said earlier. They affect almost all Londoners on a regular basis, and it is extraordinary that there is no accountability. There can be no real scrutiny of the Mayor's appointments, nor is there any democratic mandate behind them. There is no effective mechanism for the Assembly&#151;or any other body&#151;to remove tenure from any board members. Essentially and invariably, TfL simply acts at the whim of the Mayor.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000095"></a>There are clear advantages to the composition proposed in Amendment No. 41. I have already touched briefly on politics. The LFEPA model would give the board a greater ideological range, while also giving it at least a degree of political independence that is never likely to exist under the current system. A similar, and perhaps equally important, argument revolves around the geographical spread of the board members. By making up the board from representatives from both the boroughs and the Assembly, TfL will naturally have representation from all over the capital. That is important to provide exactly the sort of strategic viewpoint that the Mayor claims to love. But it would also mean that there was always a representative who had genuine and detailed knowledge of the local considerations. A broad geographical spread will allow TfL to make informed decisions on matters such as extensions of tube lines, the congestion charging zone, or buses, in a way that it cannot at the moment&#151;nor, indeed, barely pretends to.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000096"></a>The LFEPA model has functioned well without complaint or controversy. We believe that it would be entirely appropriate to employ the same model for TfL. That move would be greatly welcomed bythe London boroughs, and it would improve the body's accountability and decision-making. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000097"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07050276000390"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> The noble Lord raises an important point. Transport for London involves matters that come close to the responsibility of the boroughs, so it is different, in that sense, from the other functional bodies. The more localised things that TfL does can be quite contentious and can give rise to a good deal of correspondence.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000098"></a>We might be about to hear an answer that the Mayor, having the broad ability to appoint members of the board of TfL, can bring in experts. Excluding them from membership of the board does not mean excluding their expertise. It has struck me from observing TfL that many of the undoubtedly experts on the board have almost been acting more as consultants than board members. They have contributed a great deal but not necessarily as envisaged.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000101"></a>The GLA Act has served Transport for London well. Its board has been able to rise above competing local agendas to develop and implement a balanced strategy for the whole of London. But experience suggests that the blanket bar on political representation carries its own costs. It is important that the Mayor is able to nominate the best candidates to the board to represent the interests of those living and travelling in London.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000102"></a>Clause 18 does this by enabling the Mayor to appoint political representatives to the TfL board should he wish to do so. The Mayor will be able to appoint Members of either House, the European Parliament or the devolved Administrations and, crucially, Assembly Members and councillors from the London boroughs. For the first time, the Mayor will also be able to draw on their experience and skills.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000103"></a>Amendment No. 41, on the other hand, establishes a TfL board made up wholly of elected Assembly Members and borough representatives. I strongly resist this new clause. It fetters the discretion of the Mayor to appoint the best candidates to the TfL board and severely limits his capacity to ensure that board members can bring to bear experience in transport, finance and economics, national and local government, the management of organisations, or trade unions.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000104"></a>It also raises the danger that TfL would lose its wider strategic focus, which, as we have heard, is extremely important, being drawn down instead into vested local issues and interests. Such a position cannot be in the interests of Transport for London or Londoners and those travelling in or across London.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000105"></a>At the same time, Amendment No. 41 would remove the Mayor from the TfL board. He has significant powers over TfL, and his effective chairmanship of the organisation has served London well. It is wholly appropriate that he is able to chair, or can appoint the chairman should he wish, to provide political and strategic direction to the body.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000106"></a>I recognise that in proposing this new clause the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, are concerned, as they perceive it, at a lack of democratic accountability of TfL. But TfL is fully accountable for its actions to the London Assembly and, through it, to Londoners. The directly elected Mayor is its chairman. It is right that he should be able to decide the composition of the board and, should he wish, include elected representatives in its membership.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000107"></a>There are different models of membership for the functional bodies because the roles and functions of these bodies are different. The membership of TfL is defined by the GLA Act, and the Mayor is given more discretion in regard to the TfL board. That assists the Mayor in the delivery of executive transport powers, such as fare-setting and introducing and managing the central London congestion charge scheme, which has already been discussed in Committee.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000108"></a>There are sufficient safeguards on membershipin the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 10 to the Act provide that members must have experience in either transport, finance and economics, national and local government, the management of organisations or the organisation of trade unions. The membership&#151;this is very important&#151;must represent interests in relation to the transport of women and those who require transport accessible to persons with mobility problems.</p>

No one denies that Transport for London must have a strategic role. As I have said, it is welcome that borough councils can be represented on it. I thought that the Government believed, as I do, that we lived in a world of more localism&#151;that one has to have the strategic with the local. The Local Government Bill, which we shall consider soon, provides for much more local working. I shall not refer again to Essex, but we want more transport decisions to be taken locally rather than strategically. Local people must be involved if we are to make more popular decisions. Transport for London needs to be both strategic and local. I do not agree that the present position is right and I welcome the borough representation on Transport for London. I simply want a provision that ensures borough representation across the parties. That would work much better. Although I shall withdraw the amendments for now, I shall pursue them because Transport for London could be improved by increasing the number of local representatives from boroughs, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, suggested. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We drafted an amendment, but it was, unfortunately, rejected. It related to transport, but it  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC94"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>did not relate to the type of transport referred to in the Long Title. I hope that my noble friend can give some idea of the Government&#146;s thinking on these interesting machines.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000118"></a>As everyone in London knows, pedicab operators ply for hire. There is general agreement that they require some regulation to ensure safety, and they certainly need to be properly insured, but there is also agreement that there needs to be a fairly light touch. The Committee will probably be aware that this debate has been going on for six to 10 years. It is about time that these machines were brought under a common licensing arrangement. It should not apply only to London; there are similar problems in many other cities and towns.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000119"></a>A recent debate in Westminster Hall on this matter was raised by the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Gillian Merron, respondedthat, although it was an interesting subject, she welcomed,</p>
<ul><a name="07050276000338"></a>&#147;the steps being taken by Transport for London, as the taxi licensing authority in London, to put in place measures to bring pedicabs into its existing taxi licensing regime&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 24/4/07; col. 259WH.]</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000273"></a>I worry about that, because pedicabs are not taxis. First, they do not have motors; they are humanly and mechanically powered and travel much more slowly than taxis. They also address a very different market&#151;the tourist market&#151;and do not go too far for too long.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000120"></a>The amendment that I had intended to table defined a pedicab as a mechanically propelled vehicle that can ply for hire and take one or two passengers. Lighter-touch regulation is appropriate; quite a few local authorities in London seem to support that. They suggest that there should be licensing but that it should be light touch. Bromley wanted some form of regulation, focusing on safety, security and inspection of vehicles&#151;that is all right&#151;Westminster wanted some form of regulation because of concern about public safety; Croydon thought it was essentially a social service and that not much was required; and Southwark wanted a common-sense approach without going over the top.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000121"></a>That sums up this issue. The London Pedicab Operators&#146; Association wanted me to table the amendment, and I would have been pleased to had I been allowed. It would like some light regulation&#151;even self-regulation, if that were necessary&#151;to get things moving and provide credibility. It represents only about 30 per cent of pedicab operators; clearly, it would be much better if all operators were brought into the association.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000122"></a>I hope that my noble friend will be able to indicate that, if we cannot have an amendment in this Bill, perhaps in the next transport legislation the Government will look seriously at these issues and create a framework not just for London but for other towns. I live in Oxford, where pedicabs were operated briefly until the taxi drivers saw them off, rightly or wrongly. They all have a role to play. I hope that my noble friend will consider how this should be done to

I beg to move.</p>

I would not have thought that the clause could have sustained the arguments he has put forward. However, one has only to say &#147;clause stand part&#148;, without giving any indication of the basis, and almost any issue can be shoehorned in.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000124"></a>This is a serious problem. We tried to include similar provisions under the Road Safety Bill last year but were told that it was not appropriate there. If you cannot get these provisions into a Road Safety Bill, goodness knows where they can go. After all, pedicabs transport people from one place to another. </p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000125"></a>Westminster City Council is greatly exercised about this; there are a great number of pedicabs in central London and around the theatres. If we cannot get such a provision into this Bill&#151;and I can see that there may be reasons why not&#151;I urge the Minister to consider where primary legislation can be used to include these measures. If we are to try in every Bill that comes before us to find a loophole, it will be trying, apart from everything else, and will leave the potential problem, raised by the noble Lord, that pedicabs are not properly insured or licensed. They are a tourist attraction, and somebody will get hurt at some stage. That is an open question.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000126"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07050276000395"></a>Baroness Gardner of Parkes:</b> I, too, support the amendment. I declare a slight interest in that I live in Westminster. I have heard from councillors that there is also concern that pedicabs park on the footpath outside theatres and similar places. If there was a fire and people were trying to get out, they could be dangerously obstructed by these vehicles. I have been on buses in Oxford Street that have found it very difficult to pass these vehicles. There is definitely a case for doing something.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000127"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07050276000396"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I declare an interest as a special adviser to the board of Transport for London. I might have been appointed to the board had it not been for the political restrictions discussed under the previous clause.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000128"></a>I have to praise my noble friend&#146;s ingenuity in raising the issue in this fashion. He has, quite properly, highlighted an issue.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000129"></a>The issue does not just affect tourists. I could take noble Lords to a Sainsbury&#146;s in Liverpool Road, Islington, where pedicabs queue outside to take people and their shopping home. There are real safety questions involving the roadworthiness of the vehicles, the trustworthiness or skills of the people who propel them, and how those people behave on the road or pavements. A proper system of regulation and registration would be appropriate. Before the regulation of minicabs in London, reservations were expressed about whether it could work. Yet, I do not think that many people now would say that that regulation has been anything other than highly

A few hard-line Hackney carriage drivers might still say that it was the thin end of a particularly nasty wedge, but the public welcomed such regulation and would welcome the regulation of pedicabs.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000130"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07050276000397"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Far be it for me to challenge the Clerks, but I am concerned that a Bill in which the Long Title includes the words,</p>
<ul><a name="07050276000339"></a>&#147;to make further provision with respect to the functional bodies&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000274"></a>such as Transport for London, rules out such an issue. It also makes provision for the Greater London Authority and allows for new strategies to be promoted by the Mayor. That does not seem to stack up, so I congratulate the noble Lord on persisting by whatever means he can.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000131"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07050276000398"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> This is clearly an issue. I, too, pay tribute to the ingenuity of my noble friend for raising this matter. We have had an interesting debate and I hope that I can offer him reassurance. I welcome the opportunity to debate pedicabs, a topical issue that reflects the proliferation of such vehicles on the streets of London.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000132"></a>A range of views has been expressed about these vehicles. Some people, including my noble friend, enthuse about their contribution to London&#146;s transport system. I can understand his affection for pedicabs, having heard in an earlier debate how he and his bride travelled from their wedding to their reception in one. That conjures up a pleasant image of a romantic pedicab experience. However, not everyone&#146;s experience of them will be similar.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000133"></a>Other views have been expressed. Some taxi drivers think that pedicabs should be banned altogether. The Government&#146;s view is that they would make a valuable contribution to wider transport provision, provided that they are properly regulated. It is a concern that they are not, at present, regulated in London or, as we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in the boroughs.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000134"></a>The main issue identified by my noble friend is how to achieve proper regulation in the public interestand to ensure safety, particularly for passengers, pedestrians and other members of the public. I know that the principal operators share that objective. For example, the delightfully named pedicab operator Bugbugs met officials from the Department for Transport to explain that it wants an effective system of regulation.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000135"></a>I should make it clear that the issue of regulating pedicabs relates only to London. Pedicabs in the rest of England and Wales are already subject to licensing by local authorities, although my noble friend has highlighted concerns about that. Plans to license pedicabs in London are being developed, and it is welcome that Transport for London is taking this matter seriously, although I hear the criticism that it is taking a long time to develop those plans. TfL is the appropriate licensing authority for London and itis only right and proper that it should take responsibility for regulating pedicabs, which are very much a form of local transport within London. TfL

<h5><a name="07050276000354"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000136"></a>Once achieved, the licensing system will provide a means of exercising comprehensive but proportionate control over pedicabs in London. The licensing system will address the important issues of safety and standards that are of concern to my noble friend. It will, for example, require insurance; it will subject riders to criminal record checks; it will involve safety checks on vehicles; and it will make the riders identifiable.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000137"></a>As part of the process of establishing a licensing system TfL seeks clarification from the courts that pedicabs can actually be licensed as taxis&#151;or hackney carriages as they are termed in the legislation. This is taking time and is a main reason why the introduction of a licensing system has taken longer than all parties would have hoped. I cannot speculate on the likely outcome of the court's deliberations. TfL has powers to make the legislation needed to license and regulate pedicabs within the taxi-licensing regime. Indeed, it is now working on the necessary amendments to the London cab order to facilitate the licensing of pedicabs. However, given that there is some concern about this approach, as the noble Lord described, I welcome the fact that TfL is initiating discussions with representatives of the pedicab industry about the trade's proposal for a voluntary licensing scheme, ahead of the resolution of the legal issues. TfL is hopeful that a voluntary licensing scheme, if it proves possible, could become the basis for the enforceable licensing scheme that it is trying to achieve.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000138"></a>I hope that the noble Lord and the principal operators will find that encouraging, because I can see the possibility to discuss the concept of light-touch regulation. I hope he also appreciates that steps are being taken to establish a suitable licensing regime for pedicabs in London that seeks to ensure that pedicabs are appropriately insured. I know that the noble Lord is very concerned about that. Having said that, I support the clause.</p>

I have tried to be clear, although I may not have been clear enough. The Government welcome the fact that TfL is trying to take this forward, but it is a matter for TfL. We welcome the fact that TfL is discussing a voluntary scheme with the pedicab providers. We are speaking here about a hypothetical situation, which I think we should avoid, but we welcome those talks. If thing are taking longer than TfL and the industry would like, there is obviously an opportunity through talks to come up with a speedier

But the bottom line is that the Government want to see pedicabs regulated, in the interests of passengers, travellers and the industry.</p>

That was what I was pointing to. If there is an issue there&#151;and unlike buses, these Bills do not come along very frequently, or in many groups, as we heard in the Road Transport Act&#151;the Government could, without having to come off the fence regarding the detail of any scheme, ensure through the Bill that TfL had the powers to introduce a scheme and talk to the industry but ensure that a legal backstop was available.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000142"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07050276000402"></a>Lord Berkeley:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to this short debate. Yes, I recall, as my noble friend said, coming down the east side of Trafalgar Square with my wife, who was wearing a wedding dress, wondering whether the brakes worked. That was when the potholes were larger than they were before Trafalgar Square was redone. On the whole, pedicabs are rather good. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised an interesting point. I, too, read the Long Title and wondered why my proposed amendment could not be considered. We could not include such a provision in last year&#146;s Bill and there are rumours that there will a road safety Bill at some time in the future. In what kind of a Bill can such a provision be included?</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000143"></a>Secondly, my understanding of the issues being discussed in the court is simple: are pedicabs taxis? They do not look the same, they are not driven in the same way and I can envisage legal arguments about that. I would not bet on the outcome. Such arguments may continue for years, depending on who runs out of money first. My noble friend said that TfL and the industry were actively pursuing a voluntary scheme; that is terribly important and to be welcomed. It would be great if that were achieved and maybe one does not need legislation&#151;but such a scheme would need to be enforced. I am not sure how a voluntary scheme could be enforced, considering the nature of some of the people who drive pedicabs but are not members of Bugbugs.</p>

This amendment advances that proposal. The Assembly can already summon staff, members of functional bodies and even the Mayor to appear before it. We seek to add the health adviser and his deputies to that list.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000150"></a>The health adviser&#146;s function is to advise Assembly members on matters of public health, yet the Bill does not require him to attend the Assembly in any formal manner. At Second Reading, we welcomed the initiative that the health adviser would be subject to summons in public and we wish to know why it is not intended that the Assembly should have the power to summon those advisers to its meetings. Given the wide-ranging remit proposed in Part 4, it seems entirely appropriate that the Assembly should have such powers. I beg to move.</p>

The only reason that I can conceive is because it is envisaged in the Bill that that person may be a civil servant. We are about to consider an amendment that suggests that that person should not be a civil servant. I fail to understand why that is sufficient reason not to permit such an individual to be summoned.</p>

I am aware that the Government are sensitive about their toes being trodden on and feel that the Assembly should not step in when an individual is answerable to the Government. Given that the health adviser&#146;s remit will be to give advice to the Mayor, the Assembly would wish to be able to ask questions. If the Government are worried that that needs clarification, I am sure that that could be done quite easily. One can have a debate about whether it should be possible to have greater and more open dialogue between London and central government, but that need not be an issue with regard to this provision.</p>

The regional director for public health in London, in her current, informal capacity as health adviser to the GLA, provides the Mayor and the Assembly with expert advice on the patterns and causes of ill health in London and on proposals for action to improve health and narrow the health inequalities between Londoners. This dual role ensures that the Mayor and the Assembly can access expert advice from the person responsible for public health in London and provides a strong link between the GLA&#146;s work on health and the work of the strategic health authority and Department of Health. </p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000154"></a>The role of health adviser to the GLA was established in 2000, and is widely regarded as working well. However, the role is currently on an informal basis. We are making the role statutory simply to formalise the current arrangements and ensure that the successful co-ordination of work to improve the health of Londoners continues irrespective of changes in the political cycle or who is elected as Mayor or as an Assembly Member.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000155"></a>Amendment No. 42enables the Assembly to require the attendance of the health adviser and any deputy health advisers at Assembly meetings. We will resist this amendment. In her current, informal capacity, the health adviser meets regularly with the Mayor and the Assembly. She provides advice on public health issues and detailed briefing to Assembly scrutiny committees. She has also worked with the NHS in London to ensure that the most appropriate people are invited to give evidence to the Assembly.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000156"></a>Clause 21 ensures that the health adviser advises the Greater London Authority&#151;that is, the Mayor and the Assembly&#151;which picks up the point that was being made. We find it inconceivable that, in her capacity as adviser to the Assembly, the health adviser would not wish voluntarily to continue to attend Assembly meetings when invited to do so. We therefore see no need to compel the health adviser to do so.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000157"></a>My noble friend Lord Harris picked up the fact that the regional director of public health for London is a civil servant, accountable to the Department of Health and the strategic health authority. As such, she is accountable to Ministers and, through them, to Parliament. The Government have made it clear many times that it would be wrong to overturn the current constitutional arrangements by requiring civil servants to attend Assembly meetings. That said, given the health adviser&#146;s unique role, we would expect her to continue to work closely with the Assembly and continue to attend Assembly meetings when appropriate. I therefore hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.</p>

The fact that a particular post holder&#151;the public health director for London&#151;is accountable to the strategic health authority and, through that, to Ministers does not seem to alter the fact that it would be helpful for the transparency of work on public health if that person might, on occasions, be required to attend Assembly meetings. The fact that the current post holder voluntarily agrees to do so does not help if, in future, the post holder decides that that is not something he wants to do. The Government could take that away and look at it again.</p>

This amendment bears further consideration within the department because if I am wrong and it is not just the principle of civil servants going before the Assembly and is more to do with the merits of the case, the departmental officials should re-examine this before we get to the next stage of the Bill.</p>

The bottom line is that we are talking about the constitutional question of whether civil servants should be required to attend the Assembly. I was also putting forward the argument that because the health adviser advises the Assembly in spite of having a Civil Service position, the Assembly should not suffer. The role of the health adviser is to advise the Assembly, not just the Mayor. A Memorandum of Understanding between the health adviser and the Mayor clearly sets out the methods of communication and the level and speed of advice that is expected. There is a detailed process for working together. I hope I have answered the fundamental point and that the other points I have made reassure noble Lords that the role of the health adviser is positive for the Assembly as well as the Mayor.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000168"></a>The noble Baroness said: The motivation behind Amendments Nos. 43 and 45 is to explore further the appointment and status of the health adviser. We broadly welcome the new emphasis the Bill places on matters of public health and on tackling problems within the provision of the health service. I ought to declare my interest as chairman of an acute hospital trust in London. It is clear that, as a result of Part 4, the health adviser and, to a lesser extent, the deputies could have a great deal of influence on the health service for Londoners. As the Bill stands, the holder of the office will provide advice to the Greater London Authority on anything deemed by the health adviser to be a major public health issue and will also play a considerable role in the preparation of the health inequalities strategy. With this in mind, it is essential that we establish the Government&#146;s visionfor the health adviser and assess the level of accountability for that office.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000169"></a>Amendment No. 43 inserts new provisions into the Act making it clear that the health adviser and/or the deputies will be appointed by the Mayor and will be employees of the authority, which would enable them to be answerable to the authority. The purpose of Amendment No. 45, which is a probing amendment, is to assess whether it is appropriate that the health adviser is automatically the person who occupies the post of regional director of public health for London. We are not convinced that the health adviser should necessarily even be a civil servant from the department. There are plenty of people who are work for the health service who would be capable of doing a job such as this. The aim of this amendment is essentially to investigate the potential accountability of the holder of an office with far-reaching influence over the people of London. We welcome the creation&#151;are we all right?</p>

While welcoming the creation of a health adviser, we also question whether the Government have settled on the appropriate individual&#151;the post holder, not the person&#151;and method of selection. I have no criticism of the person, but it is a question of the office. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000175"></a>My other questions are to the Government. New Sections 309B and 309C require that the health adviser and the deputy health adviser are senior civil servants. I assume it is left as a matter of common sense that the health adviser who is appointed will be more senior in the Civil Service than the deputy health adviser, otherwise there could be a very strange position. It does not seem entirely likely.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000176"></a>I was intrigued by new Section 390A(5), which requires the health adviser to authorise the deputy health adviser. I accept that that can be general authorisation rather than specific authorisation, but is that the normal way of expressing that, or is there something particular in there? If it is particular, one might want to think further about it.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000177"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07050276000421"></a>Lord Harris of Haringey:</b> I have some sympathy with what I think the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is trying to do, but I am not sure whether her amendment succeeds in doing it. As I understand it, she wants to have a situation in which the health adviser might be the public health director, but might not be. My understanding of her amendment&#151;again I may not understand it properly, or it may not be quite what was intended&#151;is that essentially the health adviser will be an officer under Section 47 and an employee of the authority. That would preclude the possibility that the person is the public health director for London.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000178"></a>The amendment will not achieve the objective she wants&#151;which is, as I understand it, that the Mayor will have a flexibility. He may appoint the public health director for London, who would be a civil servant, or some individual who would be a highly regarded expert in the field, who for these purposes would become an employee of the authority.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000179"></a>I should like to see whether my interpretation of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment is correct and to understand a little more. While there is an enormous value in the current arrangement, whereby the public health director for London acts as health adviser to the GLA, is there is any reason why that should be the arrangement for all time? Also, are there many other civil servants whose precise role and nature is defined so precisely, given that the roles of civil servants change quite frequently, and we have not had this post for many years in this form.</p>

People are quietly picking holes in my amendments and how they are drafted. However, it is worth saying that the amendment requires exactly the interpretation that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, suggested. We do not see why it has to be the regional director; we believe that the Mayor should be able to have the choice either to have the regional director or someone else who is not within the Civil Service but who is in the health service, either as a director or deputy director. That should be optional&#151;and ifthat is not clear in my amendment, that is what it should be.</p>

I strongly resist this amendment. The regional director for public health, as the person with strategic responsibility for public health in London, is clearly the most appropriate person to be the health adviser to the Mayor and Assembly. She is uniquely placed to work across a range of organisations, ensuring that they all pull in the same direction to improve the health of all Londoners and reduce the shocking levels of health inequalities between them.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000184"></a>The Mayor, of course, has a crucial role to play, and is directly or indirectly responsible for many aspects of London life which influence Londoners&#146; health, from transport to public safety. Equally, other aspects of public health, such as improving the quality of health services delivered to Londoners, immunisation, and resilience planning in respect of health services, are clearly the responsibility of the NHS. It is therefore right that the health adviser, as London&#146;s regional director of public health, remains accountable to the Department of Health and the strategic health authority, not to the Mayor.</p>

The GLA surely wants the most senior public health official in London advising it. The adviser, by definition, advises the Mayor and Assembly. She does not take decisions on their behalf. The current adviser has proved that she does not need to be accountable to the Mayor in order to provide advice on fulfilling his legal obligations with regardto health and health inequalities.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07050276000329"></a> Clause 21, page 19, line 36, leave out from &#147;health&#148; to end of line 38</p>
</ul>
<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000192"></a>The noble Baroness said: The awesome number of amendments in this group is entirely due to the fact that an awesome number of health inequalities are mentioned in the Bill. My amendments would change the words &#147;health inequalities&#148; to &#147;public health&#148;. I shall expand on that a little.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000193"></a>The changes to Clause 22 are important. We broadly welcome the Mayor being required to provide a health strategy for London, but it needs to be of a different kind&#151;or certainly wider than that envisaged by the clause. The Minister in the other place defined &#147;health inequalities&#148; as,</p>
<ul><a name="07050276000340"></a>&#147;inequalities in respect of life expectancy of general state of health&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000276"></a>as a result of&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07050276000341"></a>&#147;general health determinants&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, Greater London Authority Bill Committee, 11/1/07; col. 119.]</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000277"></a>General health determinants include housing, transport services, employment prospects, ease or difficulty of access to public services and lifestyle or behaviour aspects.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000194"></a>Although those are very important, it is not clear that they would also encompass the important organisational aspects of public health, such as the prevention and spread of infection, the protection of the public from epidemics such as avian flu, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other health problems of diabetes, obesity, and so on. The protection of the public from epidemics is an extremely important part of the role of public health bodies, and it is important to have policies that bring co-ordination from the health service and other public bodies in the face of disasters, whether they are London-wide or confined to a smaller area.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000195"></a>Serious infection was the basis of public health policy&#151;that is where it all first started. It would seem a great mistake to jettison any of that, even by implication. Serious public health matters are currently managed  


<notus-date day="2" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC106"></a><b>2 May 2007 : Column GC106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by various organisations&#151;particularly the strategic health authorities&#151;but they should be incorporated into a London-wide public health strategy. Health inequalities will focus on the disparity between health outcomes in various parts of London and on the matters that the Minister in the other place described. This information is gathered by all local authorities in a number of ways for a number of reasons. Some local authorities try to take action. Some of the issues are extremely intangible and very difficult to deal with so they are not immediately practical issues, which public health is. For that reason, I want to see the words &#147;health inequalities&#148; changed. I do not have a problem with health inequalities being an aspect of the health strategy, but I do not think they can be the only aspect of it. The role of whoever is the health adviser&#151;we shall come back to that&#151;must encompass the wider public health aspect of the job. If not, London willget advice from somewhere. It is essential that the combined role takes account of all aspects of public health.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000196"></a>I shall give the Committee a definition of public health. It is,</p>
<ul><a name="07050276000342"></a>&#147;the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organised efforts and informed choices of society, organisations, public and private, communities and individuals&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000278"></a>It is the protection of those communities. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000197"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="07050276000428"></a>Baroness Gardner of Parkes:</b> I shall speak about these amendments in general because there is a whole heap of them. I half support what my noble friend said, in so far as I was persuaded by the Minister&#146;s remark that the right person is the regional director of public health for London. It was a well argued case, and I can see the sense in it. However, that case is for public health and supports my noble friend&#146;s amendments.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000198"></a>I find the phrase &#147;health inequality&#148; very unsatisfactory. First, it is emotive, and, secondly, if I am being the devil&#146;s advocate, when I read that one of the things the strategy must do is to,</p>
<ul><a name="07050276000343"></a>&#147;specify priorities for reducing those inequalities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000279"></a>I could say that that could be done by loweringthe standard of those who are doing well down to the standard of those who are doing badly. To reduce the inequality is not necessarily to help the people atthe bottom end to move up. I do not like thewording.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000199"></a>There are various other things. We have to be a bit careful because going back to GLC days, it was the policy of London regional government to take over the National Health Service, and I believe that the same principle follows with the GLA and that the Mayor would love to have the power to run the NHS in London. I have always bitterly opposed such a takeover because the National Health Service is such a huge concern already and to attempt to lump it in with regional government would be a disaster. The National Health Service is well run, but it is extremely complicated. My noble friend made the point thatthe Mayor should have a strategy. I agree with her definition of public health. The moment that

That would be very bureaucratic, unsatisfactory and terribly costly for London council tax payers who pay all the costs. We have to consider things very carefully.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000200"></a>This series of amendments goes a long way to help. One amendment deals with changing &#147;reduction of health inequalities&#148; to dealing with the &#147;health of persons&#148; in greater London. That is what we are all concerned about&#151;whereas the inequalities are very difficult to deal with. You could spend many years and vast amounts of money trying to decide what they were, whereas the director of public health already has a very clear image. On the other side of public health, when you are really considering something that is going to sweep in&#151;some pandemic or epidemic that may hit London&#151;there is a strong case for a strategy to deal with those situations. On the whole, these amendments are good and the Government should look again at the wording of this clause, as it is not satisfactory.</p>

There are so many things that I should like to say in response, but time is getting on&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07050276000202"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0007.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="07050276000430"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> We will have another opportunity.</p>

We need to be clear that we are talking about aspects of public health that are a subset of the whole wide range of what public health encompasses, over which the Mayor has influence. We are talking about a subset of public health, which includes areas in which health determinants come under the influence of the Mayor.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000204"></a>What the noble Baroness has been talking about is public health in the widest possible sense. It is right that we should be looking at how the Mayor&#146;s health inequality strategy dovetails with a wider London-wide effort, which plays into the role of the health adviser and why that adviser should be accountable to the strategic health authority and the Department of Health. The strategic health authority in London has responsibility for all the other aspects of health separate to those that we are talking about, which the Mayor has influence over. It is important that all of those are knitted together into a strategy that reaps real benefits for Londoners. That is the approach that is being built on here in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000205"></a>After this Committee, we should discuss how the mechanics of that will work in reality. As we have heard, tribute has been paid to the health adviser and the system has worked well, and we have the opportunity outside the Committee to work through the issues that the noble Baroness has raised.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000206"></a>We believe strongly that the Bill&#146;s focus on tackling health inequalities is justified, because broadening the remit of the strategy would dilute the focus on health

Respondents to the consultation on the development of new powers supported action to address health inequalities being prioritised through the GLA. The current Mayor also supports the focus on health inequalities, and I am sure that he would share my view that such inequalities are unacceptable in London as a world city. The health inequalities strategy will provide the necessary impetus to tackling health inequalities by giving that work equal status with other mayoral strategies.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000207"></a>For those reasons I strongly resist Amendments Nos. 47 and 48, which would rename the Mayor&#146;s &#147;health inequalities&#148; strategy the &#147;public health&#148; strategy. The term public health is too broad and potentially covers a range of aspects outside the remit of the GLA. For the same reasons, I resist the related Amendments Nos. 51 to 53, which seek to change the specifications for the strategy in similar terms.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000208"></a>I could go on about the consequential amendments, but I shall turn to Amendment No. 70, which would remove the duty on the Mayor to have regard to health inequalities in relation to mayoral strategies and to include in his strategies policies and proposals best calculated to promote a reduction of health inequalities. I come back to my point that we are focusing on the aspects of mayoral influence that affect public health in the widest possible sense. These concentrate on health inequalities.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000209"></a>Amendment No. 60 simplifies the consultation process on the Mayor&#146;s health inequalities strategy. Clause 22 requires the Mayor to consult the health adviser and bodies in London&#146;s health sector about what he should include in the strategy. In doing so, it requires him to publish a final draft. We believe that it is unnecessary to require the Mayor to publish a final draft of the strategy in order to consult about what should be included in it. We are therefore removing new Sections 309G(6) and 309G(7) to make the consultation requirements more straightforward.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000210"></a>I urge the noble Baroness to consider withdrawing her amendment and having a meeting to discuss what we have highlighted in this debate.</p>

One of the concerns of boroughs in London is that they might find that they cannot do as good a health job as they are doing with their own social services and health departments because he would be interfering and saying what they should be doing. It is all very well to give him influence&#151;everyone is very happy for him to have influence&#151;but I would want to be sure that he does not have powers to supersede or overrule what local boroughs think is right.</p>

My noble friend Lady Gardner has triggered an anxiety in my mind that boroughs will have to work in conformity with a lot of the other strategies, and it depends on how this strategy is constructed. The Mayor has influence over transport, housing and education, all of which are included in the health inequalities strategy, but he will not be able to deliver&#151;the boroughs will have to. I wonder what that level will be.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000214"></a>Government Amendment No. 60 would remove the provision that ensures that the Mayor produces a final draft. Does he have to produce any draft at all before he gets to the final draft? If there has been nothing for the Assembly to look at before it gets to the full consultation document, there is no possibility of amending it before it goes to consultation if the final draft&#151;if it is the only one&#151;is removed.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000215"></a><b><a name="70502-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07050276000435"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> The noble Baroness has picked up the key question. The idea of producing a final draft could have been perceived as a contradiction in the way in which the consultation was planned. On the health inequalities strategy, it is envisaged that the Mayor will seek to achieve results by influence and persuasion; he has no powers of implementation. It is, as the noble Baroness has said, about local delivery. Under our amendment, a final draft for the purposes of initial discussion would be produced and would be available before the Assembly considers it. I hope that that clarifies the position.</p>

I presume that this amendment will not reappear now that it has been moved by the Government and will presumably be accepted. It is a pity, because we have not really discussed at any length the Government&#146;s intention for that consultation. That is my fault.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000217"></a>I thank the Minister for her reply. The discussions she has offered will be helpful; it will be useful to see how these strategies are working. I have no doubt that what is being suggested is as it should be, but it would be very nice to see how the Mayor will do it. If I need to table the amendment again so that we can discuss it again, perhaps we can do it in a way which will be helpful as much as begging the questions. For today, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000225"></a>The amendment is tabled at the request of three organisations dealing with visual impairment&#151;the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, the RNIB and the London visual impairment forum. They sent me a six-page briefing, which I shall not share with the Committee at this stage. It makes important points about access to care services and the role of local authorities, particularly rehabilitation and the need for properly trained staff in adequate numbers.

<p><a name="07050276000229"></a>The briefing is interesting. It states that 94 per cent of local authorities in England do not employ staff who carry out full holistic assessments of individual need on the visually impaired. They are much disadvantaged. The majority of rehabilitation workers are qualified to undertake a specialist assessment of needs arising from a person's vision loss but they have neither the training nor the experience to carry out a more detailed assessment of other needs, such as those resulting from physical or mental health problems.</p>

The Government would like to think about this amendment. The noble Baroness seeks to add London borough councils and the Common Council to the list of relevant bodies and persons. In the light of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which will require upper-tier local authorities, such as London boroughs and primary care trusts, to produce joint strategic means assessments of the health and social care needs of their local population, we agree that it would be sensible to include local London boroughs and the Common Council in the list of relevant bodies and persons. This is because they are likely to have a role in implementing the health inequality strategy.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000234"></a>However, the list of relevant bodies and persons, except for the authority and functional bodies, is also referred to later on for the purposes of consultation on the preparation or revision of the strategy. The authority and functional bodies are exempted from the list for the purposes of such consultation as they are already named as consultees under Section 42 of the Act. If the boroughs and Common Council were to be included in the list of relevant bodies, like the authority and functional bodies they would need to be exempted for the purposes of consultation, as they too are listed as consultees in Section 42.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000241"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment relates to the general health determinants that are used to judge health inequalities. We are concerned with the possible discriminatory effect of the wording,</p>
<ul><a name="07050276000344"></a>&#147;and any other matters of personal behaviour or lifestyle&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07050276000281"></a>There is certain justification for the other determinants and the wording, but this one could be misinterpreted and it might be helpful to have an explanation from the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07050276000282"></a>from the description of &#147;general health determinants&#148; in relation to the health inequalities strategy. The specific listing of &#147;general health determinants&#148; such as the use of,</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000244"></a>This amendment should be resisted, as retaining this sweep-up provision at the end of the definition would serve to ensure that other aspects of personal behaviour, such as physical activity, would not be excluded without the inclusion of an all-encompassing list.</p>

<a name="70502-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07050276000245"></a>You can look at this issue from two perspectives. If you try to have an inclusive list, you can leave important issues out and that can become a problem.

<p><a name="07050276000254"></a>The Bill appears to be moving dangerously in the direction of government interference. Initially, it gives the Mayor the power to direct a citywide strategy.

<p><a name="07050276000256"></a>Secretary of State guidance is a standard requirement across all statutory strategies in the 1999 Act, so it would be inconsistent to remove the requirement in relation to the health inequalities strategy.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07050234000005"></a>The Government are strongly supportive of international efforts to tackle the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to prevent the abuse of financial systems. My Written Ministerial Statement of 7 February informed Parliament that the Government were seeking the agreement of the Privy Council for the adoption of an Order in Council concerned with giving effect to the financial sanctions against Iran's nuclear programme as required by UNSCR 1737. The Iran (Financial Sanctions) Order 2007 was laid before Parliament on8 February and came into force on 9 February.</p>

The regulation came into force on 20 April and is directly applicable in the UK. Council decision 2007/242/EC establishing the autonomous EU financial sanctions list came into force on 24 April.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07050234000007"></a>In order to enforce the financial sanctions elements of EC Regulation No. 423/2007, the Government are today laying before the Parliament the Iran (European Community Financial Sanctions) Regulations 2007. These establish prohibitions, offences and penalties with regard to persons who are on the autonomous EU financial sanctions list in relation to Iran. The Iran (Financial Sanctions) Order 2007 continues to apply with regard to persons who are on the UN financial sanctions list in relation to Iran.</p>

For this reason, the Government consider it necessary to waive the usual convention that there should be at least a 21-day period between regulations being laid and coming into force. Accordingly, the regulations will come into force tomorrow.</p>

The Sefton Coast Partnership is currently developing a new nature conservation strategy and biodiversity delivery plan for the whole Sefton Coast: this also reflects the need to conserve natterjack toad populations.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_4"></a>Whether, in cases of hearing aid tribunals for ex-servicemen whose hearing was damaged during service with the Armed Forces, they have routinely referred to later National Health Service test records when considering the suitability of their first compensation decision, or when assessing a request for review.

<a name="07050258000054"></a><b><a name="70502w0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="07050258000616"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> National Health Service audiometry records are not routinely used in deciding no-fault compensation claims. Depending on individual circumstances they may be helpful in diagnosis or for assessment if they date from around service termination. No-fault compensation is paid for personal injury and illness causally related to service. Claims are governed by the relevant law and case facts and the MoD is committed to evidence-based policy and decision making. Current generally accepted scientific understanding is that permanent hearing loss due to noise exposure does not improve or worsen on removal from the noise. In addition, when hearing loss due to age or other causes is superimposed on an existing noise-induced loss the overall loss is not more than additive. As a result, under the MoD's compensation schemes, only hearing loss measured at or around service release is included when assessing claims. To include later loss, such as hearing loss due to ageing or other sources of noise, would be to compensate for something which was not due to service.</p>

Since 1948, successive Governments have held that the NHS should be the main provider of health care for veterans. Based on NHS practice and procedures, the new service would deliver culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions through a network of public, private and charitable providers; an aim of the new model would be to integrate Combat Stress into NHS commissioning arrangements. We are looking to pilot the model at sites across the UK, with the first to be launched shortly. Discussions are well advanced in selection and setting-up of sites which we expect to be located in a range of trusts across the UK. The pilots would run for two years, after which there would be an independent evaluation of effectiveness, including value for money. An important part of the initiative is that the pilots should provide planning data on the likely demands for a nationwide veterans' service.</p>

The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 implement the age strand of the European Employment Directive. Unpaid voluntary work does not fall within the scope of the directive. The age regulations cover people working under the direction of another in return for remuneration. Practical work experience is covered as it constitutes vocational training. This follows the common definition of employment under existing legislation on race, gender and disability. We are committed to maintaining consistency in approach and definition across existing as well as new areas of equality legislation wherever practicable.</p>

In the 2005 accounts, the restated amounts of long and short-term pre-financing are given as &#8364;21,285 million (as at 31 December 2004) and &#8364;6,728 million (as at 31 December 2004) respectively&#151;totalling some &#8364;28 billion.</p>

A decision not to site the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) in the Crumlin Road gaol was taken in November 2005 for technical and cost reasons. Subsequent to this, in March 2007, a decision was taken by Maria Eagle MP, Minister for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, not to site the new accommodation for PRONI on the Crumlin Road gaol site as it did not meet the critical business needs and urgent timeline for PRONI's accommodation. The Crumlin Road courthouse was not considered on its own as a site for PRONI. In the 1990s it had been considered in combination with the gaol as a possible location for PRONI but this did not proceed beyond preliminary investigations.</p>
