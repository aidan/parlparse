Let us be clear about this Government's record. Between 1997-98 and 2008-09, we delivered almost 500,000 new affordable homes. These included newly built housing and property that was acquired and refurbished. That would not have happened if we had not developed programmes such as Decent Homes.</p>

However, what will he do to dispel the perception that senior judicial appointments are taking longer than ever to make and are more politicised than ever, even though the Supreme Court has been established and the Judicial Appointments Commission has been set up to promote the separation of powers?</p>

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="10032376000058"></a><b><a name="100323-0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="10032376000416"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, it may be true that senior appointments are taking longer to make than they did when they were within the sole discretion of the Lord Chancellor. Indeed, in his evidence to the Select Committee on the Constitution, the Lord Chancellor admitted that the new process is somewhat clunky. The process was decided by this House and the Lord Chancellor has an appropriate role in it. In the evidence to the same committee, it is interesting to note the extent to which the Lord Chancellor set out his two roles: the typical role of a Secretary of State and a special role as Lord Chancellor, principally related to the judiciary and the maintenance of its independence. In that special role, for which he takes a particular oath under the Constitutional Reform Act, he is involved, as Parliament expected, in the process of senior appointments.</p>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="10032376000059"></a><b><a name="100323-0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="10032376000417"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, this matter has been sitting on the Lord Chancellor's desk-somewhat clunkily, as the noble Lord puts it-for some three months. Does he think that a three-month delay, with its attendant uncertainty, is good for the Family Division?</p>

<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="10032376000060"></a><b><a name="100323-0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="10032376000418"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, the Lord Chancellor's policy is to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to individual appointments. The appointment will be announced after the Queen has approved it. That policy has been adopted and adhered to by successive Lord Chancellors. Therefore, I shall not comment on how long it has been on anyone's desk. As far as we are concerned, the beginning of the process is in the public domain and it will end when the appointment is made. Other recent senior appointments, such as the President of the Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice, President of the Queen's Bench and others, have taken between three and eight months. Today we announced the appointment of Lord Justice Dyson as a justice of the Supreme Court, and that process took seven and a half months.</p>

He is regarded as a most thorough and compassionate judge in the legal profession. Was that because, last November, he told the Association of Lawyers for Children that it was the duty of judges to come off the Bench and speak out about government changes to the law that were damaging the service to children and families, or because he warned that, without proper legal aid funding, the justice system would implode and that children would suffer the most? Was not the Lord Chancellor's decision entirely political?</p>

I am making it very clear how we appoint people to virtually every job in the public or private sector, and I am insisting on that definition. As for the speed with which these appointments are made, I will again quote the Lord Chancellor, using reported speech as it will be quicker. In the processes below these senior judges, the new system is working efficiently and in a way that a Lord Chancellor could not do without considerable sub-processes. In the processes for the most senior appointments, I think he has said in passing that, looking at the Act, perhaps this part is "clunky".</p>

It is a matter for the Opposition to choose how to vote on the issue. I see that they did not have common cause on this with the Liberal Democrats, but it is for them to explain the matter, not me.</p>

Therefore, would it not be inappropriate for my noble friend to tell us today what the Government intend to do before we have had the final decision this afternoon of the House of Commons-the elected House that is full of MPs whose constituencies may or may not be affected?</p>

It was for the convenience of the House. There is no point in causing people to have to go through the Lobbies again. That would have been perverse. It was to help the House to make progress on this matter.</p>

In line with the procedure agreed by the House, the Public Bill Office yesterday advised the usual channels that Amendment 7 on the Marshalled List falls outside the guidance in the <I>Companion</I> on Third Reading amendments. On the basis of the advice of the Public Bill Office, the usual channels are recommending to the House that Amendment 7, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, should not be moved.

Given that this clause specifies the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_852"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 852</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inclusion of religious belief, philosophical belief and a lack of religious or philosophical belief, we felt that it was important to probe the Government to discover exactly what it covers.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="10032376000101"></a>We have heard time and again that part of the purpose of this Bill is to simplify and codify existing equality legislation so that it is clear and easily understandable. It was therefore appropriate to have a discussion to elicit clarification from the Minister as to exactly what would be included in the definition. We were informed by the Minister that European legal obligations do not define specifically what the terms mean but that case law has determined that,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000313"></a>"beliefs must attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance, provided that the beliefs are worthy of respect in a democratic society, are not incompatible with human dignity and do not conflict with the fundamental rights of others",</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000275"></a>and are,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000314"></a>"beliefs as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behaviour and not an opinion based on the present state of information available".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/1/10; col. 521.]</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000276"></a>This guideline as to the definition of what could be included under the clause seemed proportionate.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10032376000102"></a>Moreover, in Committee in another place, the honourable Mr John Mason tabled an amendment to what is now Clause 19, which has the heading "Indirect discrimination". His purpose was to put in the Bill a provision under which making a person act contrary to the doctrinal or ethical teachings of a religion or belief was also indirect discrimination. This would be in addition to the fact that religion was already included as a protected characteristic. When this amendment was debated, the honourable Dr Evan Harris spoke in opposition to it, warning that such an amendment would include beliefs such as Scientology and religious sects and cults. In response, the Solicitor-General agreed that such an amendment would muddy the waters because it would then be unclear if something should be regarded as indirectly discriminatory if it contravened beliefs that are not doctrinally or ethically linked to a religion but are nevertheless commonly held. The honourable Mr Mason withdrew his amendment on that basis.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10032376000103"></a>Parliamentary debate shows clearly therefore that a reference to religious or philosophical beliefs should not include cults or other similar belief systems. It therefore seems sensible and in line with the debates in another place and in your Lordships' House that a spokesman from the Government Equalities Office attempted to distance himself from the draft code of practice published by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for consultation. The draft guidance clearly states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10032376000295"></a>"Cults and new religious movements may also be religious".</p>

<p><a name="10032376000277"></a>It uses vegans as an example, saying that they will be covered by the legislation. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10032376000296"></a>"A person who is a vegan chooses not to use or consume animal products of any kind. That person",</p>

<p><a name="10032376000278"></a>opposes,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000315"></a>"the exploitation of animals for food, clothing, accessories or any other purpose and does so out of an ethical commitment to animal welfare".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000279"></a>This person is likely to hold a belief that is therefore covered by the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_853"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 853</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10032376000104"></a>We on these Benches felt that debates in another place and in your Lordships' House had shown clearly that, while there was no specific definition, the weight of case law meant that only serious and important beliefs would be included as a religious or philosophical belief for the purposes of the law. On seeing the draft code of practice, we felt therefore that debates in Parliament had come to one conclusion but that the codes of practice had carried on in another. Surely the nature of religious and philosophical belief systems to be represented by this protected characteristic was clear from these debates; to include cults and other lifestyle choices such as veganism and vegetarianism is to make something of a farce of the debates that we had.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10032376000105"></a>The spokesman for the Government Equalities Office clearly felt similarly when trying to distance the Government from the draft guidance. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10032376000297"></a>"The Equality Bill does not change the existing definition of religion or belief and the Government does not think that views or opinions based on scientific-or indeed on political-theories can be considered to be akin to religious beliefs or philosophical beliefs. Nor was it the intention in introducing the legislation that such beliefs should be covered".</p>

<p><a name="10032376000106"></a>Nevertheless, we have since discovered that the Government Equalities Office, far from disagreeing with the conclusions here, had signed off the codes of practice. The inclusion of cults and vegans comes, rather surprisingly, with the endorsement of the Government, but I think that I am right in saying that Jediism does not.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10032376000107"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify precisely the Government's position. While the position in parliamentary debates seems to have been one thing, is she concerned that it may cause confusion that the Government have publicly distanced themselves from the position taken in the guidance but have officially signed off that draft guidance? I am rather confused by this. I look to the Minister for clarity.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10032376000108"></a>We feel that, on this issue, the Government have drifted away from what Parliament decided. If this is the case in this instance, can the Minister assure us that the guidance in other areas reflects more closely the debates in your Lordships' House and in the other place? Furthermore, if the Government intend cults to be included, can the Minister inform the House whether further guidance will be required? Does she concede that this will complicate matters further? What exactly will be included in the definition of a cult? How organised and established would a cult have to be in order to be included and to have to count? At what point would a group that has coalesced because of a common interest be defined as a cult? What about the many people who may not consider themselves to be a cult but are formed out of an objection to another group of people? How exactly is this going to work?</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10032376000109"></a>We were initially rather shocked at the length of the codes of practice. I am informed that these are the draft guidance for the courts, not for everyday use. We certainly would not wish the codes to become even longer, but it is certain that more clarity is needed and I hope that the Minister can provide it today. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_854"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 854</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It declares for the avoidance of doubt, but if it were enacted, although I know that it is only probing, it would increase rather than avoid doubt about the meaning of "religious", "philosophical" and "cult". Words are not like crystals, brittle, rigid and hard-edged. They are soft and flexible and convey shades of meaning that alter according to the context in which they are used.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10032376000111"></a>That is especially true of words such as "religion", "belief" and "philosophical belief", derived from international and European human rights instruments and our own constitutional and legal heritage. When those words are used in legislation, they have to be read and given effect in accordance with their proper meaning and effect and they have to be read compatibly with European law. It is for the courts and not politicians to interpret and apply them. Parliament could, of course, attempt to define their meaning, but it would have to do so in a way that did not violate the fundamental human right to freedom of religion and belief. That would be a hazardous undertaking, fraught with difficulty.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10032376000112"></a>Every established traditional religion was once regarded pejoratively as a cult by its opponents from other religions when it was struggling for recognition and acceptance for its beliefs and practices, whether the three Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, or non-theistic religions, such as Buddhism. Every organisation, religious as well as non-religious, may abuse its powers and tolerate or conceal evil and criminal practices, as recognised by Pope Benedict XVI's pastoral letter of apology to the Catholics of Ireland about the abuse of children and vulnerable young people by priests and others.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10032376000113"></a>One person's religion and belief may be another's blasphemy or evil cult. According to medieval Roman Catholic doctrine, those who did not believe in the divinity of Jesus, or who contradicted Catholic dogma, or had not been baptised, were "infidels", put to death during the Crusades and the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions. There is still much intolerance within and across religions of all types.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10032376000114"></a>Those of us who are fortunate to live in modern democratic societies, whatever our faith or lack of it, are committed to a generous view of equality and personal liberty. The Strasbourg court explained in the case Kokkinakis v Greece:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="10032376000298"></a>"Freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a democratic society within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has clearly been won over the centuries, depends on it".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10032376000115"></a>In another case with an unpronounceable name, Leela FÃ¶rderkreis EV v Germany, the Strasbourg court decided that the conception of the world of the Osho movement, formerly known as the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh movement, founded by the Indian mystic Rajneesh Chandra Mohan, based on the idea of achieving transcendence, fell within the ambit of Article 9 of the convention, even though the group was commonly referred to as a sect. Of course, that did not mean that the group had absolute rights. The court upheld the German Government's right to verify whether a movement or association carries on, ostensibly in pursuit of

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10032376000116"></a>The UN Human Rights Committee has explained, in its general comment on the equivalent of Article 9 of the convention that is in Article 18 of the covenant, that it,</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10032376000117"></a>Concepts such as-I say this humbly in the presence of the Lords spiritual-"religion" and "philosophical belief" are not capable of precise definition and the differences between them are not clear-cut. The <I>Concise Oxford English Dictionary </I>defines as the first meaning of "cult",</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000317"></a>"a system of religious worship especially as expressed in ritual".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000280"></a>It defines "religion" as,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000318"></a>"belief in a superhuman controlling power, especially in a personal God or gods entitled to obedience and worship".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000281"></a>Buddhism, which falls outside that definition, is defined as,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000319"></a>"a widespread Asian religion or philosophy ... which teaches that elimination of the self and earthly desires is the highest goal".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000282"></a>Scientology is defined in the same dictionary as,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000320"></a>"a religious system based on self-improvement and promotion through grades of self-knowledge".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000118"></a>I have acted for the Church of Scientology, which is recognised as a religion in some European countries, such as Spain and Portugal, and some Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, and rejected by others. In this country it is treated at present, as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Segerdal in 1970, not as a religion but as a system of philosophical belief.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10032376000119"></a>The word "cult" is not in the Bill. If the reference to "cult" in the amendment is meant to make it clear that the Bill does not protect organisations and their followers who engage in criminal or anti-social misconduct, that goes without saying, whether the organisation is Jewish or Muslim, the Catholic Church or, I dare say, the Church of Scientology. Using the word "cult" merely raises the question whether those who follow a particular creed or share a common belief are entitled to be protected from discriminatory treatment because they share a common religion or philosophical belief. That involves questions of fact to be decided not by politicians or Parliament but by courts in particular cases.</p>

<a name="100323-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10032376000120"></a>For all those reasons, the amendment would not achieve the aim of its proposers, although I understand them. Whether one agrees with what is in the code is not what I am on about; I am concerned to establish that, were the amendment to be enacted, it would be a source of great uncertainty and would not fulfil the aim of its proposers. We would therefore be opposed to it.</p>

Under the terms of the Bill at present, are the activities of that "church" protected, as any religious organisation is protected? Without this amendment, would that protection be a part of the provisions of the Bill? On the other hand, do the Government regard the Church of Scientology, as I do, as a cult, which would not be protected if the amendment were passed? I simply wish to know the Government's views on this issue.</p>

The way in which the words are used means that this is one of those irregular verbs: "I have a faith, you have a religion, he or she is in a cult". One person's use of a particular term may be pejorative, flattering or whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10032376000123"></a>I regard the original clauses as extremely odd. A reference to "religion" includes a reference to a lack of religion, "belief" means any belief and a reference to "belief" includes a reference to a lack of belief. When I studied philosophy, if you started saying that "P equals not P", you had to go back to the drawing board and begin again. If we want to regulate some religions/cults or others, this sort of Bill is not the way to do it. By adding extra words here and there, as yet undefined whether in Europe or elsewhere, we will merely make confusion worse confounded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10032376000131"></a>It is not our intention that the religion or belief provisions of the Bill should extend protection against discrimination to any inappropriate groups whose activities would give cause for concern. The noble Baroness is perfectly correct that there is no legal definition of what constitutes a cult, and there is unlikely to be any consensus of opinion on what one is. Nor is there a single, simple, non-legal definition of cult. Indeed, some dictionary definitions of cult could be held to apply equally to widely held systems of religious or philosophical beliefs. Therefore, in cases in doubt, the appropriate body to determine whether something is a protected religion or belief is the relevant tribunal or court. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lester, whose remarks I think amply illustrate why this is the case.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10032376000132"></a>It is important to appreciate that tribunals and courts will not be working without guidance. The Bill gives a broad definition of religion or belief that replicates the effects of the existing definitions in the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 and the Equality Act 2006. Domestic courts therefore already have experience of interpreting the existing definitions and the considerations that they need to take into account. Seeking to exclude certain systems of religious or philosophical beliefs as being cults would therefore not only be a new issue for the Bill but a change to legislation that has been in place since 2003 and has not caused difficulties of interpretation in this respect.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10032376000133"></a>European directives that relate to matters of religion or belief do not attempt to define specifically what the terms "religion" or "belief" mean; nor does Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, case law has identified the relevant factors that need to be taken into consideration when determining if something may be considered to be a protected religion or belief. The main limitation on what constitutes a religion in line with Article 9 is that is must have a clear structure and belief system. The limitations on what constitutes a philosophical belief are that it must be genuinely held; be a belief and not an opinion or a viewpoint based on the present state of information available; be a belief as to weighty and substantial aspects of human life and behaviour, attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness of cohesion and importance; and be worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with human dignity and not in conflict with the fundamental rights of others. Therefore, in terms of restricting protection to those beliefs which are not objectionable, the case law criteria would exclude most of the outlandish practices and belief systems that have been mentioned so far. For example, any cult involving illegal activities would not satisfy the criteria.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10032376000134"></a>The noble Baroness asked specifically about the guidance and the codes of practice. The Government have not signed off the commission's codes of practice; the codes are out for public consultation, which is due to close next month. In order to take effect, they will need to be laid before both Houses of Parliament in due course. Whether any particular religion or

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10032376000135"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned veganism. It would ultimately be for the courts or tribunals to determine whether something met the definition of "religion or belief" according to the criteria established by case law. In the case of H <I>v </I>UK 1993, heard by the European Court of Human Rights concerning the treatment of a vegan, the court determined that veganism was capable of being construed in accordance with the scope of Article 9.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10032376000136"></a>The noble Baroness referred to Jedis. The Government do not think that views or opinions based on science fiction can be considered akin to religious or philosophical beliefs. It was not the underlying principle behind drafting the definition of "religion or belief" to cover such views.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10032376000137"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, referred to the Church of Scientology. The Equality Bill does not alter the current interpretation of what constitutes a religion or belief, defining it as,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000321"></a>"any religious or philosophical belief",</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000283"></a>or a lack of any such religion or belief. We do not maintain a list of recognised religions or beliefs, so if there is any doubt whether something constitutes a religion or belief within this definition, that would ultimately be a matter for the courts or tribunals to decide.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10032376000138"></a>Given that explanation, I hope the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

I am one of those lawyers, as I presume the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is, who would prefer lawyers not to earn off the back of uncertainty but for the public to be able to consult documentation and be clear about what is and what is not a protected characteristic.

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10032376000142"></a>Noble Lords will recall that the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, tabled Amendments 20A and 44A on Report. In speaking to those amendments, which he withdrew, the noble Lord, Lord Low, referred to the need to spell out what the phrase "avoid the disadvantage" means when the disadvantage is caused by a physical feature, otherwise there was a risk that the intention to reproduce the current law, which we all share, might be put in doubt. The noble Baronesses, Lady Warsi and Lady Morris of Bolton, also tabled a probing amendment on these matters in Committee.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="10032376000143"></a>When I spoke on Report I said that we wanted to give further consideration to the matter and, in particular, to ensure that whatever outcome we reached would deliver a consistent approach throughout the different parts of the Bill. We remain of the view that the reasonable adjustment duty, as drafted, works. That being said, however, we have listened to the concerns that noble Lords set out and have decided to act to move the matter beyond doubt.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10032376000144"></a>Amendment 2 draws on some familiar concepts from the Disability Discrimination Act and sets out on the face of the Bill, in a non-hierarchical and non-exhaustive way, some key considerations that should be taken into account when the duty to avoid the disadvantage caused by a physical feature is being addressed-whether by an employer, someone providing services or someone delivering public functions. This amendment provides the clarity being sought and reinforces what already appears in the Bill.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10032376000145"></a>Amendment 8 is a minor and technical amendment which ensures consistency of approach between Schedule 2 and Schedule 15. It makes clear that an association should consider a reasonable alternative method of affording access to a benefit facility or service, et cetera, where the substantial disadvantage caused by a physical feature cannot be reasonably avoided.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10032376000146"></a>Amendment 10 is consequential on Amendment 60, which the noble Lord, Lord Low, tabled on Report and which added a definition of substantial to Clause 212(1). It simply adds an entry of "substantial" into the index of defined expressions in Schedule 28.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10032376000147"></a>I hope noble Lords will be satisfied with this outcome of our further deliberations, and I commend these amendments to the House.</p>

Noble Lords might remember that we tabled a similar amendment to Schedule 2 in Committee; this was followed by a further amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Low, on Report. It was felt that these amendments would be useful to help make the duty more active and to exemplify what specific steps could be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10032376000149"></a>The Government, however, objected to our amendment. Although the Minister took on board that concerns had been raised about the lack of these specific steps, which used language very similar to that of the Disability Discrimination Act, she said that it,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000322"></a>"had been interpreted as weakening the provision ... That is certainly not the intention and is certainly not the case".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/01/10; col. 879.]</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000284"></a>The Minister then objected to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Low, but on entirely different grounds-namely that it applied to services and public functions and so appeared to give credence to the idea that these steps should not also apply to other areas.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10032376000150"></a>We are delighted, therefore, that the Government have now taken on board these legitimate concerns and tabled their own amendment. It was interesting to hear the reasons for the Government's change of heart at this late stage, and we welcome the clarity that the Government have now added by moving the amendment to prime position in Clause 20(4). This is a welcome concession to worries expressed both here and in another place. In our amendment, however, we included the option of providing,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000323"></a>"a reasonable method of providing the service or exercising the function".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000285"></a>Perhaps the Minister can quickly touch on why this part has been left out of the final amendment.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10032376000151"></a>I turn to Amendment 8. We are glad that the Government have addressed the inconsistency here. This appears to be a sensible amendment which clarifies the steps that must be carried out to ensure that where a physical feature puts a disabled person at a considerable disadvantage, the feature is removed or reasonable alternative steps are taken.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10032376000152"></a>I seek clarity on two points. First, I hope the Minister will be able to offer us some assurances that the reasonable alternative methods of access will not put too great a burden on employers. Will she offer some examples of what might be considered reasonable? As we have said throughout these debates, we think that it is of the upmost importance that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that where a disabled person is placed at a substantial disadvantage, that disadvantage is minimised. However, we also want to ensure that such steps do not put an undue burden on employers. Secondly, and with that in mind, will the Minister say what form the guidance on this provision will take? It is very important that employers are aware of exactly where their duties lie, and what practical steps they might have to take to fulfil those obligations. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

It is a matter of exclusion or inclusion. While there have been huge improvements in accessibility in the past few years, all too many providers still do not understand their duties, or blatantly choose to disregard them. Importing some of the familiar language of the DDA into the Bill to exemplify the duty is very important, and the amendments confirm that the intention is to reproduce the current law and not, as some providers think, to dilute the law. Some believe that there will be a change in the law that will make it much easier for them to disregard their duties. We welcome the language translation across.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10032376000155"></a>As well as thanking the Minister, I thank all noble Lords who have helped us to secure this amendment and others in this incredibly important, integrated Equality Bill.

Purists might say that Amendment 2 is not strictly necessary because it reflects existing case law, but it is good to make it clear in the Bill that the test is one of substantial disadvantage. For the reasons just given by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, we are delighted with the amendments.</p>

I completely agree that importing the language at the outset from the DDA into this Bill has been extremely important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10032376000158"></a>On the questions posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, the Equality and Human Rights Commission is currently consulting on draft guidance and the code of practice which will help employers to understand the requirements to make reasonable adjustments. We hope that the guidance will provide straightforward, practical examples illustrating how to comply with the law. I suspect, although I do not know, that employers' organisations had a great deal to say about the draft guidance to ensure that that is the case. As a general principle, we want employers to be able to carry out their duties under the legislation but not to be overburdened by it.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10032376000159"></a>We have listened to noble Lords about the merits of providing greater clarity in the Bill and we have responded by putting the matter beyond doubt.

During the Bill's passage through Report, Clause 104 was amended to include a new subsection (3)(c) which contained an explicit requirement that any action taken by political parties in pursuit of reducing inequality in their representation in any elected body must be a proportionate means of achieving that purpose. The amendment contained an explicit cross-reference to the single-sex electoral shortlist provisions in subsection (7).</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10032376000161"></a>The shortlist provisions in subsection (7) will automatically be repealed at the end of 2030 unless their use has been extended by order. This minor amendment will ensure that in the event that subsection (7) is repealed, the cross-reference to those provisions in subsection (3)(c) would be removed at the same time and so not leave any extraneous and potentially confusing references within the Bill.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10032376000162"></a>As this is the last government amendment before we conclude Third Reading, perhaps I may say a few words of thanks, but I recognise that there are more amendments to come. I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to the Bill from every side of the House. We have heard many considered and persuasive contributions and undoubtedly we now have a better Bill. I thank my noble friend Lady Thornton for her dedicated and committed support. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, for the knowledgeable and expert role that he has played in our debates. He has put us back on the right track on a number of occasions, for which I am extremely grateful. He has been extraordinarily self-disciplined, but that was shared by Members all over the House. I also thank his noble friends Lord Wallace of Tankerness and Lady Northover.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10032376000163"></a>I have greatly enjoyed my exchanges with the noble Baronesses, Lady Warsi and Lady Morris of Bolton, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, during the passage of the Bill. They have shown commitment and have challenged the Government to explain their intent clearly. Their expertise and experience have informed our debates and our thinking on various amendments. Thanks are due to noble Lords too numerous to name who have played a very important role in our proceedings. However, I single out the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Alli, and the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, for their suggestions and challenges, which have helped us carefully reflect on the Bill. As ever, they have defended disadvantaged groups in our society with passion and dedication.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10032376000164"></a>A number of noble Lords have promoted the rights of disabled people, notably the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, who has proposed many important amendments which have been accepted, including a clarification to ensure that people have access to information in accessible formats, the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton, whose amendment clarifies that in meeting the equality duty, the steps involved in meeting the needs of disabled people include taking account of a disabled person's disabilities, and, of course, my noble friend Lady Wilkins.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10032376000165"></a>I also thank the many individuals and organisations who have played a vital role in the development and passage of the Bill. Several thousand individuals

Finally, I thank the Bill team, parliamentary counsel and the officials from across Whitehall departments who have worked assiduously and tirelessly on the Bill. They have shown tremendous determination, patience and resilience throughout. Melanie Field deserves our special thanks, also Wally Ford, to whom we wish a speedy recovery. This is a good Bill. It is much better than the Bill that arrived in this House. We have had a tremendous and very thorough consideration of it in this House. I beg to move.</p>

The Bill is a great achievement. I know of no measure as ambitious and far-reaching in any part of the world. It is the result of many years of effort, imagination and skill. New Labour's 1997 election manifesto promised to,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000324"></a>"eliminate discrimination wherever it exists".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000286"></a>The Liberal Democrat manifesto contained a commitment to enact a single Equality Act. For four years, Professor Sir Robert Hepple QC directed an independent expert review published in July 2000. It was the subject of a consultative conference. My Private Member's Equality Bill was prepared to give effect to the Hepple report and was given a Second Reading in this House on 28 February 2003 with wide support. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, is in his place because as the Minister he was kind enough to describe the Bill as "quite outstanding" and said he believed it would "not die a death".</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10032376000167"></a>We introduced that Bill to demonstrate that it was possible to create a coherent, user-friendly, non-bureaucratic framework, while encouraging voluntary compliance with the principle of equality without discrimination through workforce reviews and employment equity plans, and to provide effective redress. At that stage the Government responded piecemeal by introducing regulations to implement the new EU equality directives as well as the Disability Discrimination Bill setting up the Equality and Human Rights Commission and making religious discrimination unlawful. They then set up the discrimination law review in 2005 and published papers between 2007 and 2009. The Bill was at last published a year ago in April 2009. The appointment of the right honourable Harriet Harman as Minister for Equality gave the project a new energy and sense of direction and ambition. She and her fellow Ministers here and in the House of Commons have been advised and supported by an outstanding team of some 44 civil servants, if one includes legal advisers and parliamentary counsel, led by Melanie Field, James Maskell and Wally Ford. They will be cross if I do not mention all 44 but I do not think I should. I pay tribute to them for having delivered at last a Bill of which we should all be proud.</p>

<a name="100323-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10032376000168"></a>The Bill reached this House very late, with parliamentary time scarce before the general election. But, as the Leader of the House has indicated, thanks  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_864"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 864</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to cross-party co-operation and a great deal of hard work, we have carried out a thorough scrutiny of it and improved it in important ways. The Leader of the House, the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, and civil servants have been generous in making themselves readily available to discuss the Bill, and have been open-minded in considering proposed amendments. The Official Opposition have played a constructive role and, for the most part, we have been able to achieve consensus, drawing on the great experience of many Members across the House. Not everything in the Bill is as we Liberal Democrats would have wished, but we recognise that law reform, like politics, is the art of the possible. We hope the Bill will now pass quickly into law, after our amendments have been approved in the other place, so that it may be carried into effect by the new Government of whatever colour after the election.</p>

Those present in this Chamber today who were also present for our previous debates on the subject of equality will know that, while there have been areas of this legislation and specific amendments over which I have raised concerns, I have still broadly supported the aims and intentions of the Bill. That continues to be the case. The reason we have all spent long hours discussing this Bill is because we want a workable law on the statute book that really does something positive in the area of equality in the United Kingdom. To lose this opportunity now and scrap the Bill would be to lose something that is wonderful. It would be a great disappointment, especially when so much common ground has already been established. We have all tried to be magnanimous, meeting each other half way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10032376000170"></a>I agree that we need to avoid and reject the bigotry of fundamentalism. I recall the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, who rightly reflected that, at times, equality, human rights and freedom have become in themselves a religion or a philosophical belief. Ignoring older, established religions and preventing them from teaching their principles will in the end serve only to produce a generation that cannot see the point of equality, freedom and human rights as a religion, especially when it resembles a juggernaut crushing all other religions before it and ends up setting up a hierarchy of rights where traditional religious ethics are at the bottom. Individuals with their human rights become hermetically sealed and atomised from community belonging and responsibility, for ever echoing the playground diplomacy, "It is not fair. It is my human right to trump yours". We need to encourage a society where people are allowed to be different. Equality means celebrating diversity, and religious tradition and belief must be allowed to be part of this growing diversity.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10032376000171"></a>We need to be wary of creating laws which serve no one but those working in the legal profession. As the Chief Rabbi, the noble Lord, Lord Sacks, commented recently:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="10032376000302"></a>"There are times when human rights become human wrongs".</p>

<p><a name="10032376000287"></a>He said that rights must not,</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000325"></a>"become more than a defence of human dignity".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000288"></a>He said that when these rights become a political ideology that tramples down everything in its path, we know we have gone too far.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10032376000172"></a>As the late Lord Denning once observed, the severance of law from morality and religion from law has gone much too far. Although religion, law and morals can be separated, they are nevertheless still very much dependent on one another. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10032376000303"></a>"Without religion, there can be no morality, there can be no law".</p>

<p><a name="10032376000289"></a>Our commitment from these Benches to establishing a solid and workable piece of equality legislation demonstrates that crucial interconnectedness.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10032376000173"></a>As we pray in this your Lordships' House before every sitting, we say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10032376000304"></a>"Almighty God .... do most humbly beseech thee to send down thy Heavenly Wisdom from above, to direct and guide us in all our consultations; and grant that, we having thy fear always before our eyes, and laying aside all private interests, prejudices, and partial affections, the result of all our counsels may be to the glory of thy blessed Name, the maintenance of true Religion and Justice, the safety, honour, and happiness of the Queen, the publick wealth, peace and tranquillity of the Realm, and the uniting and knitting together of the hearts of all persons and estates within the same".</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10032376000174"></a>As your Lordships will know, in previous debates concern was expressed about some parts of the Bill. I believe that the high level of debate and scrutiny with which this was undertaken by noble Lords enabled significant improvements to be made to those parts which seemed, in the view from these Benches and those opposite, not to be in the spirit of preserving the status quo, as seemed to be implied in the Bill.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10032376000175"></a>What I and my fellow Lords Spiritual have called for is not a special role for religion in this legislation. What we want to see is freedom and equality for all, including those with religious beliefs. We must maintain the intermingling of religion, morals and law-balancing the rule of law, freedom and conscience, as this country always has done.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10032376000176"></a>We have come a long way with this Bill. Earlier, in Her Majesty's Government's attempt to harmonise all existing laws on equality, I felt we had a situation such as the one Morecambe and Wise experienced with AndrÃ© Previn. Previn became exasperated and told Morecambe he was playing "all the wrong notes". Eric stood up, seized Previn by the lapels and menacingly informed him:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="10032376000305"></a>"I'm playing all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order".</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10032376000177"></a>I believe that what we have now in the Bill is approaching the right order. This is becoming a stronger piece of legislation by the day, thanks to the discussions we have had and continue to have. I look forward to the day the Equality Bill makes it onto the statute book, and for that reason I hope that noble Lords will join me in backing this Bill at Third Reading, so that it may be sent to another place for enactment.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10032376000178"></a>To err is human; to forgive is divine. I am grateful to all of those who have listened, been patient and who have actually produced the legislation that I am proud to have been part of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10032376000185"></a>Many people, Christians and others, will continue to resist any blurring of the distinction between marriage and civil partnership and will want to watch very carefully the ensuing regulations as they appear.

Also, it remains rather puzzling to many of us that there should continue to be a prohibition on the use of any religious service while a registrar is officiating at the signing of a civil partnership document, even though the signing might take place on religious premises. It does not do much to allay suspicions of a hidden agenda. But we are where we are, a lot of people have worked very hard to bring us to this point, and it is good to be able to meet where we have.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10032376000186"></a>I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, for being willing to build on the declaratory provision in his earlier amendment concerning religious freedom. It has been clear throughout the discussions that the House has been motivated by a concern for equality, freedom and non-discrimination in all sorts of ways, and with seeing these in a cohesive single picture. However, the discussions have also highlighted how complex it is to balance out those three things together and what happens when different rights appear to come into conflict with each other. The present amendments ought to serve the bringing together of human freedom, equality and non-discrimination in a much better way, and therefore serve the original aim of the Bill.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10032376000187"></a>In a multicultural and pluralist society, it is right to recognise the rights of different religious and other groups to approach this matter in different ways in accordance with their own convictions. In my last intervention I said that I hoped a way might be found to enable Quakers, liberal Jews, Unitarians and others the freedom to host civil partnership registrations if they wish, but not inadvertently to create an obligation on those-the majority-for whom this would be impossible. From the rather particular situation of the established Church, it would be important that any parochial or diocesan action should be consequential on church-wide policy.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10032376000188"></a>Finally, we welcome the amendment which means that this clause, like most of the rest of the Bill, will be brought into force by a commencement order rather than immediately on Royal Assent. There will clearly need to be new regulations prepared to amend or replace the present Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Approved Premises) Regulations 2005. Extensive consultation will be needed at this time with churches and other faiths about the drafting of the regulations. I am very grateful to the Minister for the constructive discussions between church officials and the Government Equalities Office over recent weeks. Clearly, there will now need to be very widespread consultation in order to get the regulations right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10032376000189"></a>We expect that it will be open to the Church of England and other religious communities to determine what are their own relevant decision-making bodies with authority to notify a public authority-presumably the Registrar General-if they wish to opt in to the approved premises arrangements for civil partnerships. Local applications for particular premises could only be considered when such opting-in had occurred, and would then be handled in the perfectly normal way. It

First, I cannot imagine anyone except the noble Lord, Lord Alli, achieving what he has. He is one of the most indefatigable lobbyists in this House-I mean lobbyist in the good, unpaid sense-that I have ever known.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10032376000191"></a>Secondly, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chichester was right in everything that he said. When we introduced the Civil Partnership Bill, we used civil marriage as the analogue to create civil partnership. What we are doing here is allowing a religious aspect to civil partnership, because there cannot be a religious marriage. In the longer term, one may need to look at the consequences for civil marriage in relation to religion. However, that is far beyond the scope of the amendment. The way in which this has been done, and the compromise that has been reached, is in all respects admirable.</p>

Although equality and anti-discrimination issues are generally reserved to this Parliament under Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act, will the Leader of the House confirm that the subject matter of the amendment is such that it would be within the competence of the Scottish Parliament to make parallel changes in Scotland if that Parliament wished to follow the example set by this House?</p>

As we said on Report, we are very supportive of civil partnerships, and so were not without sympathy for the intentions behind his original amendment. However, we felt that this was not an appropriate time in the parliamentary calendar to open up complex issues that merited proper attention and scrutiny. We thought that such a change needed to be carefully thought out, consulted on and debated fully. The amendments in this group go some way towards answering our concerns, by making it clear that the right to register a civil partnership in religious premises is purely permissive, and that denominations should be able to opt in to the system as they choose. We welcome the clarity here.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10032376000194"></a>However, some areas of concern remain. Those representing independent churches are worried that they still risk being left open to litigation. They are concerned that there is scope for the anti-discrimination provisions to make it difficult-or appear to make it difficult-for individual churches not to opt in to hosting the civil partnership ceremony. I understand  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_869"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 869</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and of the Government, is that the amendment should be purely permissive. It would be most helpful if the Leader of the House could offer reassurance to independent churches.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10032376000195"></a>Another concern that has been raised is that churches should not be judged for what they choose to do. Will the noble Baroness reassure church groups that not only will there be legal protection for their decision on whether or not to conduct civil partnerships, but that their decision will be perfectly permissible under religious freedom? Will the Leader of the House confirm that there will be further consultation on this issue? I ask because a number of questions have been put to us. As I understand it, the legally binding part of the civil partnership ceremony will still have to be carried out with no religious language. This creates an odd situation if the ceremony is taking place in a church. Has any more thought been given to how this might work? Will it mean that the couple have a ceremony in church with readings and hymns, but then have the civil partnership commitment using no religious language at all? If this is the case, will the minister-I mean the religious minister, not the political Minister-be empowered to perform the civil partnership, but be banned from using any religious reference at this point of the ceremony? Or will a civil registrar have to take that part of the ceremony, without having played any part in the religious sections? Are we in danger of discriminating against heterosexual couples, who must have either a religious marriage or a civil one, but who cannot combine the two?</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10032376000196"></a>By seeking answers to these questions, and wishing to ensure that they are addressed fully, we are in no way being negative. We welcome the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and the further clarity they bring to the amendment which was accepted on Report.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="10032376000197"></a>I thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Royall and Lady Thornton, and their very effective Bill team for their tireless work as this Bill has made its passage through your Lordships' House. Some areas are still subject to differences of opinion, but we have always made it clear that we wish to see the Bill on the statute book. The hard work and dedication of all noble Lords and everyone involved has meant that rigorous scrutiny has taken place and good changes have been made. We now commend them to the judgment of another place.</p>

It is in total contravention of the marriage which God ordained when he made mankind and put mankind into the world. It is totally wrong and I do not believe that any Christian church which is founded on the word of God can possibly be forced to carry out such partnerships in its places of worship. Although we are told that they will not be forced to, I fear that pressure will be put on churches to do so against their consciences, otherwise there will be a cry of discrimination. I do not believe in discrimination because of a person's orientation, whether sexual, religious or anything else, but it is wrong and dangerous to overthrow certain limits.</p>

<a name="10032376000200"></a><b><a name="100323-0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10032376000492"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, Amendments 4, 5, 6 and 9 relate to Clause 202 and to civil partnerships in religious premises. These amendments make technical improvements to the provision brought forward by my noble friend Lord Alli on Report, ensuring that the provision delivers the intention debated at that time. I made it clear during the debate on Report that, while the Government were sympathetic to my noble friend's intentions, the amendment he had tabled did not entirely achieve what he had hoped for. The amendments we are considering here are welcome additions to the provision, addressing many of the concerns I raised.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10032376000201"></a>It may be helpful to take a moment to clarify what these amendments would achieve. As noble Lords will be aware, it is not possible to register civil partnerships on premises which have not been approved for that purpose. My noble friend's original amendment would remove the current prohibition on religious premises being so approved. Under the current regime, it is the trustee or proprietor of premises who applies for approval. In the case of religious premises, that would leave the decision whether or not to apply entirely in the hands of those with control over individual premises. For those denominations that wish to maintain a consistent line across all their premises, that might cause problems.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10032376000202"></a>Accordingly, Amendment 4 adds a new subsection (2)(b) to Section 6A of the Civil Partnership Act, which would enable the regulations setting out the approved premises regime to provide for applications for approval in relation to religious premises to be made only with the consent of specified people, but that regime would not have to apply to all denominations. As new subsection (2)(c) makes clear, the regulations would be able to make different provision for different kinds of premises, so would allow those faiths or denominations that want to have a consent mechanism to have one, and those that do not could leave it up to those in charge of individual places of worship. So the right reverend Prelate is absolutely correct about the process and about the fact that the new regime would

I hope that will reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Paisley.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10032376000203"></a>I also assure the right reverend Prelate that there would be extensive consultation before these powers are used. We want to engage all interested parties, including people of all faiths and denominations, to make sure that the regime that is put into place reflects the position that each one wants to take. As my noble friend has said, his intention is to create an entirely voluntary regime, and these amendments would allow the Government to tailor it to the requirements of different denominations with different organisational structures and different views, as we have heard today, on whether they would wish to take advantage of it.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10032376000204"></a>I make it clear to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that there is no question of the proprietor of religious premises, or a religious organisation or anyone else, being liable for discrimination for deciding not to host civil partnership registrations on their religious premises. It is unlawful to conduct civil partnership registrations on premises that are not approved for that purpose. It is not possible to bring a claim for discrimination for failing to do something which is unlawful. There is no obligation on the controllers of religious premises to get them approved, and since seeking approval is neither the provision of a service nor a public function, for the purposes of the Equality Bill, there is no scope for a claim for discrimination being brought for failing to do so. With this in mind, I can be very clear that no amendment is required to cover this possibility. Indeed, to introduce such an amendment would be counterproductive in that it would imply that the Bill's provisions cover this and other matters to which they do not currently extend.</p>

<a name="100323-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10032376000205"></a>The noble Baroness asked about religious language and about how things would work. My Lords, it would work very much like it does for marriage, where a couple go to a side room, such as the vestry, to sign the register. A civil partnership registrar will still be required to officiate the signing of the register, and it is correct that there can be no religious service during the civil partnership registration.</p>

The noble Baroness mentioned the possibility of heterosexual couples who are not currently allowed to wed in a church being discriminated against. It is up to the churches themselves whether or not to allow heterosexual couples to get married. For example, some individual churches within the body of a Church do not wish to marry couples who have been divorced, but that is entirely a matter for the churches themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10032376000208"></a>I turn to the remaining elements of Amendment 5. Subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c) are needed because this clause now includes a reference to civil marriage and  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_872"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 872</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>religious premises. It is therefore necessary to define what is meant by these terms. The definitions are the same as used elsewhere in the Civil Partnership Act 2004. Amendment 6 to Clause 216 brings the commencement arrangements for Clause 202 into line with the rest of the Bill, ensuring that the clause can be commenced in an orderly fashion when supporting regulations are ready. Finally, Amendment 9 simply adds the provisions in the Civil Partnership Act repealed by Clause 202 to the list in Schedule 27 to the legislation repealed by the Equality Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10032376000209"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, asked about Scotland. As he suggested, this provision applies to England and Wales. If the Scottish Parliament wishes to do something, that is entirely up to it.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10032376000210"></a>I conclude by saying that the Government welcome these amendments, which address the concerns expressed by a number of religious organisations. I appreciate the comments made by the right reverend Prelate, and I am delighted to hear that constructive discussions between the various organisations have led to a broad, supportive consensus on these amendments. As I said on Report, we need to continue to listen to views from the widest possible range of religious organisations and from others with an interest when we consider the implementation of these provisions. As I have made clear this afternoon, full consultation will be needed to ensure that the regime for the approval of religious premises for civil partnerships is workable in practice for all faiths and denominations.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10032376000211"></a>These new amendments will help to achieve such a workable solution. However, noble Lords will also recall that I said on Report that this is an issue of religious freedom and religious conscience; so, should the will of the House be tested on these subsequent amendments, the Government will allow a free vote.</p>

It is as simple as that, and no more difficult. We have not tried to go through the back door to allow a parish church to sue the General Synod. We had a very simple objective, which I hope we will have achieved. When I say "we", it is a real case of the Back-Benchers talking to the Front-Benchers. I ask all three parties and the usual channels to think more carefully about what those of us on the Back Benches have to say and to make it a little easier for us to intervene in our debates, because we, too, have a contribution to make to this House and it often feels as though we are not heard. I suspect that this debate will move on to a debate on the regulations, which I await with interest.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10032376000217"></a>The orders reflect several elements. The outline framework has been set by successive Acts of Parliament since the Good Friday agreement. The detail of what is to be devolved reflects discussion in Northern Ireland over a period of years. The final timetable for devolution was set out in the Hillsborough Castle agreement, which was reached in early February after several weeks of negotiation. In a clear sign that Northern Ireland institutions are gaining in capacity and maturity, the British and Irish Governments were not parties to that agreement, unlike the agreements that preceded it. It was the work of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, leading the two largest parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10032376000218"></a>The formal request for the devolution of the issues dealt with in the orders before us today was made by the Northern Ireland Assembly on 9 March, with over 80 per cent of Members voting in favour. In line with the timetable agreed at Hillsborough, the orders before us provide for devolution to take place on 12 April. Many people in Northern Ireland, and beyond, have shown great courage and leadership in making these developments possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10032376000219"></a>President Obama, in Washington last week, paid tribute to the First and Deputy First Ministers, who, as he said, have stood together with conviction to chart an historic path towards peace. I believe that we should echo that commendation. But the credit extends well back into the past. It is right that we acknowledge the role of the party opposite in its willingness to take the early risks in establishing the peace process-notably John Major, who as Prime Minister worked closely with the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, supported by the distinguished Secretaries of State, the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10032376000220"></a>Since that period the two Governments have worked together in close co-operation and with an enormous commitment of time and effort at the very top. The present Prime Minister and his predecessor worked together to great effect with Bertie Ahern and then Brian Cowen to guide the process along. They of course worked with others outside government, and we must all remember the distinguished role of John Hume, and later of Dr Ian Paisley and of Gerry Adams. I must of course pay special tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, who played a key role and whom we are proud to have among us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10032376000221"></a>This morning I read the speech made yesterday by Dr Ian Paisley in another place, his last speech in that House. For me, it symbolised just how far we have come together, and I felt quite emotional when I read it. However, we should not forget either those who have sustained the process from abroad. There has been enormous good will from many quarters, including the European Union and the other states which have contributed to the International Fund for Ireland. We have also benefited from the expertise of distinguished figures from a number of nations who have helped to advance the process.</p>

In the current Administration, I should like to offer particular thanks for the help and support we have had from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has taken personal responsibility for the Administration's policy in Northern Ireland and shown to all those who have dealt with her a deep knowledge of Northern Ireland issues and sensitivity to its particular circumstances. Nor, finally, should we forget those figures in the Congress and the Irish-American community who have over the years exerted a powerful positive influence in encouraging advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10032376000223"></a>All the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly accept in principle the need for devolution of policing and justice at some point. The Ulster Unionist Party, of course, had hesitations about its devolution at this point, and despite efforts to reach an accommodation, it voted against devolution. The Government believe profoundly that devolution does need to take place now, but we recognise that the concerns were of substance and sincerely felt. Nevertheless, the Assembly voted by a very large majority to move on. I hope that if the House does the same today, the doubts can be set aside and all concerned will focus on making the institutions work with their new responsibilities. I believe that that will be the case.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10032376000224"></a>Let me now turn to the detail of the three orders before us. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Amendment of Schedule 3) Order 2010 is the key document. It provides for policing and justice matters, which until now have been reserved, to become transferred matters. The Assembly will then be able to legislate on them without having to seek consent. The list of matters transferred precisely reflects the Assembly's requests of 9 March. In line with that request, certain matters will remain outside the responsibilities of the Assembly; one is parading. The Hillsborough Castle agreement, however, envisages that the responsibility for parading will transfer later in 2010, once new arrangements proposed in the agreement are in place. Another exclusion from the list of matters transferring is special provision for 50:50 recruitment to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. We believe, however, that it is likely that the 30 per cent target for police officers from a Catholic background will be reached later this year, and the special provision will lapse at that point. National security matters will remain excepted and will not transfer under this order to the Assembly. They will properly remain the responsibility of UK Ministers answerable to this House.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10032376000225"></a>The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Devolution of Policing and Justice Functions) Order 2010 makes a large volume of amendments consequential on the changes in legislative competence. These amendments largely involve the transfer to Northern Ireland authorities of executive functions, reflecting the transfer in legislative responsibility. The main recipient of these functions is the new Northern Ireland Department of Justice which the Assembly has already legislated to establish. In the case of some functions that will transfer, there is potentially an interface with national security matters  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_876"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 876</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that will remain the responsibility of the Secretary of State. In these cases, the order makes clear the respective roles and responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Justice Minister and the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10032376000226"></a>There remain concerns among some in Northern Ireland about the split between responsibility for national security and policing in justice matters following devolution. It is imperative that national security is protected in these arrangements, but clearly the post-devolution arrangements have to be workable. That is why it is vital that the Justice Minister and the Secretary of State establish clarity about their respective responsibilities. It is also important that the Justice Minister has access to the information necessary to properly fulfil those responsibilities. These statutory responsibilities are set out in the legislation before the House today.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10032376000227"></a>In addition, we have set out in a protocol details of how the national security interface will work. It sets out a number of safeguards which will operate to ensure the workability of these arrangements. In addition to the existing mechanisms, I draw attention to the exceptional role that will be played by the independent reviewer, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, who we have asked to review any decision to withhold information from the published reports of any of the oversight bodies. The order makes provision in line with the Hillsborough Castle agreement that quasi-judicial decisions may be made by the Justice Minister and need not go to the Northern Ireland Executive. The order also gives effect to various transfers of property and most of the staff of the current Northern Ireland Office. These staff will move to the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, leaving a small number of staff who will continue to work for the Secretary of State on his remaining responsibilities.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10032376000228"></a>Finally, the Northern Ireland Court Service (Abolition and Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2010 establishes the Northern Ireland Court Service as a separate civil service and transfers its functions, which are currently the responsibility of my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor, to the Northern Ireland authorities, generally the Department of Justice. The staff of the Court Service will also be assimilated into that department. The Justice Department will have a generous financial provision. All but Â£26 million-that is, 2 per cent of the Northern Ireland Office's current baseline budget-will transfer to the Northern Ireland Executive, as will all the Northern Ireland Court Service baseline budget.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10032376000229"></a>In addition, the Northern Ireland Executive will benefit from the Â£800 million financial package agreed by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in October last year. These orders would come into effect on 12 April in line with the Hillsborough Castle agreement. It will then remain only for the Assembly to complete the necessary preliminaries and, notably, the selection of a Justice Minister by the Assembly on or before 12 April, and devolution will come into effect. At that point the devolved institutions will be able to focus without distractions on the important issues that are of concern to people across the community in Northern Ireland who fall within its responsibility. That includes the wide range of socio-economic issues that are already

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10032376000230"></a>There is great scope for the devolved institutions to develop their own approaches to protecting the public from crime and anti-social behaviour that suit the Northern Ireland context best. My ministerial colleagues have worked hard to achieve this, benefiting from discussion in this House and another place. With the devolution responsibility, opportunities open up to engage the Northern Ireland community further in the local development of the most appropriate solutions to their problems.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10032376000231"></a>The political progress that lies behind the presentation of these orders has the potential to make Northern Ireland a profoundly better place. It is a triumph of politics. Of course there are those in Northern Ireland-although very few of them-who do not want to see politics succeed. They believe that they can bring about political change by violence and that they have the right to kill indiscriminately without the smallest vestige of popular support in the pursuit of their ambitions.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10032376000232"></a>We have seen the appalling crimes that the dissident republicans are prepared to perpetrate. Following the murders of two soldiers and a policeman last year, they continue to try to kill entirely fruitlessly and to the horror of almost everyone in Northern Ireland. They have not succeeded in taking another human life since those appalling crimes, but we are mindful of the appalling injuries inflicted on Constable Peadar Heffron, and of the further acts of violence that they have perpetrated since. In the fight against the threat to democracy, we will be unstinting.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10032376000233"></a>We have ensured that the Police Service of Northern Ireland has substantial extra resources this year and next specifically to take on the dissident threat, but it is the political agreement that we have seen on the way forward in Northern Ireland and the manifest public desire for politics to work, rather than violence to usurp its place, that will most dishearten the tiny group who still believe that some benefit can come from wrecked lives and a wrecked society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10032376000234"></a>The vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly earlier this month, which the orders before your Lordships today endorse, is a vote to unite in the face of the effort of the dissidents. It is a vote for Northern Ireland to put the years of the Troubles further behind it and to face squarely the challenges of the future. I commend these orders to the House.</p>

It was very clear and easy to understand and I thank her very much for that. As she made clear, these orders give effect to the agreement reached between the DUP and Sinn Fein at Hillsborough Castle on 5 February and to the vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly on 9 March. Once these orders pass through your Lordships' House, devolution of policing and justice powers to the Assembly will take place on 12 April. The last major element of the Belfast Agreement, made almost

For the first time since the powers were taken away from the Northern Ireland Government in March 1972, Stormont will once again exercise powers over policing, criminal justice, the courts and local security issues.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10032376000236"></a>Let me be clear: the Conservative Party has long supported, in principle, the devolution of policing and justice powers. We said this as far back as 1998, when I first began to represent Northern Ireland in your Lordships' House for the Opposition. These powers are best exercised in Northern Ireland by politicians accountable to the electorate there, not by Ministers in your Lordships' House or in the other place. That is why we supported the legislation this time last year, even though we believed that, with a little more time, it could have been improved. It is why my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, met the First and Deputy First Ministers in the autumn and rapidly pledged that, should we win the election, we would honour the substantial, post-dated financial package agreed by the Prime Minister.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10032376000237"></a>We welcomed the Hillsborough Castle agreement, and my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition expressed his hope at the time that it would lead to the completion of devolution. At all times our overriding objective is a peaceful, stable and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all of its people have a shared future. Whether we remain in opposition or return to government in a few weeks, that is the approach that we shall continue to take, so we shall, of course, support the orders before the House today. However, there is also an important principle to consider relating to devolution.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10032376000238"></a>Even if any noble Lords had misgivings over the vote on 9 March, they should remember that it represented the democratically expressed will of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Members of this House have no business seeking to frustrate that; it is how devolution works across the United Kingdom. Equally, we should be careful in this House when it comes to seeking to force parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly into voting in a particular way. Devolution is about locally elected politicians using their judgment to make decisions on devolved issues in the best interests of Northern Ireland. It is the role of Parliament to respect these democratic decisions and not to interfere. Of course we can all use our influence but, ultimately, votes in the Assembly are for the Northern Ireland parties represented there to decide.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10032376000239"></a>As the House is aware, the vote on 9 March was, regrettably, not unanimous. My colleagues in the Ulster Unionist Party had a number of genuine and legitimate concerns over education and the working of the Executive as a genuine four-party coalition. Failure to deal satisfactorily with these prevented the Ulster Unionists from backing the Assembly vote, and the Government know well that my party-both I and the shadow Secretary of State-implored the Secretary of State to correct that situation during the negotiations.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10032376000240"></a>The Ulster Unionists are not alone in expressing dismay at the lack of a genuine four-party coalition; the new leader of the SDLP made the same points in Washington last week. We hope that these outstanding issues can now be resolved in a spirit of genuine  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_879"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 879</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>partnership and compromise in the working group at Stormont. We cannot go on with two of the coalition partners feeling excluded from key decisions. That runs counter to the inclusive nature on which the power-sharing institutions were established. In our view, it is vital that we return to a genuine four-party coalition, as set out in the Belfast agreement.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10032376000241"></a>Once the devolution of policing and justice takes place next month, this will become more important than ever if the transfer is to take place in a stable political environment. The imperative for all elected representatives is to ensure that devolution works to deliver effective law and order for the entire community in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100323-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10032376000242"></a>As the Secretary of State has acknowledged, the immediate priority is to deal with the threat of dissident republicans. In recent weeks and months they have increased their activities as they seek to bring death and destruction to Northern Ireland's streets and drag us into the past. Barely a day goes by when the bomb squad is not called out. There have been the recent incidents in places like Keady, Newry and many others, and our thoughts are with Constable Heffron, who remains seriously ill in hospital today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10032376000243"></a>We share the hope that returning policing and justice powers to local politicians will lead to the increasing isolation of the dissidents. They offer the people of Ireland, north and south, absolutely nothing. But it will require the fullest support and backing of the police and the criminal justice system from everyone in our Parliaments and living in Northern Ireland. Following devolution, any lingering reluctance to co-operate with the police must be at an end. While we welcome the acts of decommissioning that have taken place in recent months, tackling loyalist criminality must also be a priority. It is not just paramilitary-related crime that concerns people in Northern Ireland; in many neighbourhoods it is the same issues that are far too commonplace on this side of the water-anti-social and yobbish behaviour, lack of respect and so-called "low-level crime" that blights people's lives all the same. As the Executive take on these powers, there are a number of difficult challenges ahead.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10032376000244"></a>In addition, the arrangements that are to be put in place after 12 April are interim. They expire in May 2012. There will need to be a clear focus on establishing a permanent system following the next Assembly elections.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10032376000245"></a>We should also be clear today what we are not devolving to the new Justice Minister. He or she will not have the power to run the police, nor will they have the right to interfere with the judiciary. The PSNI will remain under the control and direction of the chief constable, who is primarily accountable to the Policing Board. Operational independence, as the Prime Minister said in response to my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition in February, remains vital and will be preserved.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10032376000246"></a>Those with responsibility for the administration of justice are under a legal obligation to uphold the independence of the judiciary. These are absolutely cardinal principles for policing and justice throughout the United Kingdom. They must apply equally in Northern Ireland. We cannot tolerate any political interference in these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10032376000247"></a>The noble Baroness also mentioned that 50-50 policing had not yet been devolved. However, everybody here knows that there is an undertaking from the Government, which is agreed by my party, that it will end, come what may, the next time it is due for review. As far as the parades issue is concerned, she also said that there was more work to be done on that. We agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10032376000248"></a>It is our sincere hope that with devolution complete politicians in the Assembly can begin to focus on the other issues that really matter to the people of Northern Ireland. While it is important to get policing and justice right, people on the ground are also concerned about issues such as jobs, health, tax, schools and social deprivation. The Assembly Executive must not let the Northern Ireland people down any more.</p>

We very much welcome them and wish them well. The Liberal Democrats have long believed that policing and justice powers should be devolved to the Assembly, if and when it wanted such powers. It is a crucial element to devolution and it will be a significant achievement when the powers are indeed devolved in April as the agreement has set out. These orders are the next step in that process.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10032376000250"></a>The Assembly voted earlier this month, as we know, by a cross-community vote to ask for the powers to be transferred from Westminster to Northern Ireland. That was a momentous occasion, as it is today, signifying a new era for the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. We are confident that the Assembly will rise to the challenge and show that it can deliver for all the people in Northern Ireland. Devolution of policing and justice will deliver an enhanced level of accountability to the people of Northern Ireland and allow more direct representation of their needs to the departments and agencies that are responsible for delivering the services and benefits that are part of justice and policing powers.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10032376000251"></a>The orders represent the cementing of the peace process. This issue has represented innumerable challenges and difficulties for the political parties in Northern Ireland and the British and Irish Governments. It has taken almost 12 years from the signing of the Good Friday agreement to reach this point-a long and hard journey-where a crucial element of the devolution settlement has finally been put in place.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10032376000252"></a>Once the powers contained in the orders have been transferred to the Assembly, I have no doubt that the Assembly will demonstrate that it is capable of taking responsibility for difficult decisions and will take those decisions in the best interests of all the people in Northern Ireland. The devolution of policing and justice is an opportunity for leadership and a chance to make a genuine contribution to Northern Ireland's political growth and development by publicly demonstrating that Members of the Assembly have confidence in the abilities and stability of the devolved institutions, even when it comes to sensitive issues such as policing and justice.</p>

Those issues are simply not dealt with properly unless those sitting in the Executive in Northern Ireland are able to deal with the wider picture and have full responsibility for tackling those problems.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10032376000254"></a>It is only right that, as on other issues, locally elected and accountable people will have the opportunity to influence and direct policy on policing and justice matters and to work with their colleagues in the Executive to bring coherence to policing and justice. Devolution will not be able to deliver in all the areas that it needs to until these powers are transferred.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10032376000255"></a>Momentous as this debate in this House is today, what is important is what happens once these powers have been transferred to Northern Ireland and how the Assembly delivers on criminal justice for the people of Northern Ireland. The speeches in the Assembly during its debate on transferring policing and justice powers showed that Assembly Members themselves wanted to see better services for victims and witnesses; more visible policing on the streets; increased integrity in sentencing; better management and rehabilitation of offenders; and the prevention of offending and anti-social behaviour on the streets of Northern Ireland. That is what we all hope the Assembly will be able to achieve once it is taking decisions on these matters for itself. From these Benches, we wish all Assembly Members every bit of good luck in this challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10032376000257"></a>Today we have a Prime Minister and a Secretary of State-Shaun Woodward-who have chosen to ignore the centre ground of politics in Northern Ireland in favour of an exclusive carve-up of its future among two parties that are driven by years of mockery and exploitation of the people of Northern Ireland. Before anyone tells me that I should be celebrating the transformation of the DUP and Sinn Fein, let me spell out the inconsistencies of those two parties. The latter has, as we all know, murdered its way to power; it is led by murderers who not only will never be brought to justice in this life but will never be publicly examined. I have, by necessity, accepted that and sought to put the past behind me, as has the Ulster Unionist Party. But at the same time, every alleged mistake and misjudgment of police and military who were placed, ill prepared and ill equipped, between the killers and the vulnerable general public 40 years ago is still being judged against today's background of comparative normality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10032376000258"></a>For 12 years-a political lifetime in new Labour parlance-we have been promised and waited for the Saville report, only to be given the impression over the

We will not hear about the Â£200 million-worth of millionaire lawyers that the initiators dare not reveal at the hustings. Against that, retired police officers, some now in their 80s, are still being held to their honour obligations in relation to events up to 30 years past. There are no millionaires there-they are lucky, while their retirement has been held to ransom, if they get lunch expenses for their time.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10032376000259"></a>There is not much point in going into the history of the DUP, which brought down the Sunningdale agreement in 1974, when Sinn Fein did not even exist as a political party and we could have dealt with people such as the late Lord Fitt. The same DUP mimicked the Red Berets at their King's Hall rally, misled the unionist electorate with lies about the danger of the Belfast agreement and then proceeded to undermine it, weaken it and remove its safeguards at St Andrews and through its recent Hillsborough aberration.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10032376000260"></a>Why has it been necessary for me to recount these destructive realities from the past? It is quite simply because Shaun Woodward has pandered to the baser instincts of these very people with Â£800 million of blood money. Let me try to understand that vast sum that the Secretary of State threatened to deny policing and justice unless a deal were done. Was this money actually needed for policing and justice? If so, was the Secretary of State telling us that he was prepared to leave the people of Northern Ireland at the mercy of dissident IRA and criminal gangs? Was this a bribe: "I will create a little trough into which you can stick your snouts"? When one sees what has gone on over the past eight or nine years-not least the wheeling and dealing of the past few days-I suppose that anything is possible. Or was it blackmail: "Secretary of State, we will do anything, but you will want to pay us"? It has to be one of those three, unless, of course, the Minister is minded to admit that it was simply the mindless arrogance of Shaun Woodward. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, described him last week as the worst Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for the past 11 years. Well, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was very wrong: Shaun Woodward has been the worst Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for the past 38 years and it is against that background that I evaluate his policing and justice debacle.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10032376000261"></a>Before I leave the Â£800 million mystery money, let us remember that Northern Ireland has been asked to make over Â£400 million-worth of savings this year, with Â£113 million being deducted from health and social care, which is already underfunded by up to Â£600 million compared to England. The DUP and Sinn Fein are no better than Shaun Woodward at understanding and controlling public finances. The wastage in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister alone is staggering. It has 400 staff, which is more than Downing Street. There are four separate ministerial private offices and eight advisers. The recent opinion poll commissioned by the same office cost upwards of Â£40,000. This figure alone would have paid for an extra four heart operations or seven hip replacements.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10032376000262"></a>Moreover, opinion polls are not the flavour of the month. The Secretary of State spent the equivalent of one heart operation plus one hip replacement on his

Noble Lords should listen to the question. It reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="10032376000312"></a>"I believe we should transfer policing and justice powers to Stormont"-</p>

<p><a name="10032376000290"></a>that would have been all right, but it goes on-</p>
<ul><a name="10032376000326"></a>"so that the Executive can get on with the job of improving life for everyone in Northern Ireland".</ul>
<p><a name="10032376000291"></a>Is that a loaded question? Yes, just as loaded and heartless as trailing a poor, grieving widow out on the first anniversary of her husband's murder to make a personal appeal. How cynical can the Northern Ireland Office be?</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10032376000263"></a>Let me now move to the state of policing and justice that the Assembly will inherit. We have a Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland that could not win the Omagh bombing prosecution, whereas the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, from this House, won a civil case based on the same incident. The Public Prosecution Service could not win the McCartney murder case, despite dozens of witnesses. This was the same Public Prosecution Service that would not prosecute the Thomas Devlin murder until the persistence of the family and the public forced it to do so, when a verdict of guilty against the two defendants was obtained after the victim's families were put through hell. That is the same for most trials where few if any serious crimes are brought to court inside a period of two and a half to three years. Justice delayed is justice denied.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10032376000264"></a>Forty-four thousand police files go annually to the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland. Justice is regularly delayed. Is it any wonder that we have a high rate of recidivism? It is similar with policing. Just this weekend a major police operation was fired on by dissidents without fire being returned. Despite more than half a dozen dissident murders in the past year or thereabouts, not a single shot has been returned. In one case, the police, having dissident gunmen in their sights, were congratulated on withdrawing from the scene. What are we getting into?</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10032376000265"></a>I know from long, personal experience at the coal face that no one from the Assembly is equipped to provide what policing and justice require in Northern Ireland. Paul Goggins, despite the hindrance of the Northern Ireland Office, has made a valiant effort, but there is no one in the Northern Ireland Assembly who would know a gun from slingshot or who has any practical knowledge of youth justice, the probation service, prisons, courts or any of the complex aspects of what has to be undertaken. Not only that, but the agreed, negotiated d'Hondt system has to be corrupted for a Minister of Justice to be appointed. Not an iota of planning and preparation has been achieved. No one in your Lordships' House who has served our country in uniform will be other than shocked that not a single command or infrastructural provision has been decided on, let alone established. One might as well put David Ford, an agreeable man against whom I have no prejudice whatsoever, into a rocket aimed at the moon and expect him to come back.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10032376000266"></a>For the right reasons but with the wrong approach, we are heading for disaster. That is progress, or so I am meant to believe. If I look depressed, that is only half of what I feel.</p>

<a name="10032376000267"></a><b><a name="100323-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10032376000503"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, there is a saying in Northern Ireland that if you have to say something, say nothing. This is the time to say very little, so I will therefore be brief. It is easy to raise emotions in Northern Ireland because although there is an agreement it is by no means an assurance of a long-term settlement.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10032376000268"></a>I was Minister of Home Affairs in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s, working with the police. The devolved Parliament at that time had its own Attorney-General. That was the position of the Ulster Unionist Party at that time: devolution, control of policing and control of the judicial system. Then we had direct rule and all that was lost, including the then Parliament at Stormont. Indeed, when I was Minister of Home Affairs I was shot 10 times in my body by republican terrorists. However, we have moved on. This is not the time to talk about red berets or anything else but to look forward, we hope to a new horizon in Northern Ireland. It deserves a chance.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10032376000269"></a>When asked recently about the devolution of policing and the judicial system, Mr Gerry Adams said, "Oh, yes, we must get it. We must get it out of the hands of the British. We have never had that in Northern Ireland". Once again, Mr Adams showed his lack of knowledge of history. We had it for 50 years, from 1921 to 1972. All we are asking for now is to have it returned to the devolved institution at Stormont. That is what we negotiated-David Trimble and I, supported by my colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, and the present leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Sir Reg Empey. This is one of the things we achieved in the Belfast agreement. The legislation before us is simply a fulfilment of what was requested at Easter 1998. Therefore, I welcome the orders that have been presented to the House. However, I want to make one or two small points in relation to them.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10032376000270"></a>First, I firmly agree with the idea of the 50/50 enrolment into the Police Service of Northern Ireland being retained in our national Parliament. That should not be a devolved matter. Secondly, as regards property being transferred, I notice that the address of the independent commission-that is not its full name-is not given. Does it not have any property, or is it intended that we should withhold from the public the address of the property that it occupies? All the addresses of all the other properties are listed but not this one. I should like to know the reason why no address is given. In relation to the transfer of property, I am astonished to see that Stormont House is not being devolved. We have three Stormonts in Northern Ireland: the Parliament Buildings at Stormont; Stormont Castle, where the Northern Ireland Office is based; and, of course, Stormont House. Stormont House was always part of the devolved institution at Stormont. It was, in fact, the home of the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Parliament. As he had long distances to travel every day, perhaps from Londonderry or from Fermanagh, a home was provided for him. When we got direct rule, the then Government of Mr Heath stole Stormont House and took it over. I would have expected it to be transferred, on the completion of devolution, back to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10032376000271"></a>The one thing that I am delighted about is that the whole question of policing and justice is now being transferred to Stormont. That was the traditional  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_885"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 885</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>position of the Ulster Unionist Party throughout 50 years. When we got direct rule in 1972, the then Prime Minister-the late Brian Faulkner-resigned, which brought about the collapse of devolution in Northern Ireland. He said that there was no sense carrying on governing Northern Ireland if policing and justice were not devolved. When Mr Heath decided to take those powers away from Northern Ireland, it brought about the collapse of devolution. Devolution will collapse once again if we do not get those powers back to Stormont. That is what we are trying to achieve today.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10032376000272"></a>Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, is right in one respect. There are problems with the Northern Ireland Executive. They are making little progress. The whole question of secondary education in Northern Ireland has not moved for a year under this Executive. The whole question of the reform of local government is static-nothing is happening. There is a possibility that if the Executive do not start producing results for the people of Northern Ireland, they will lose credibility and will collapse once again. But let us give Northern Ireland a chance. Let us see whether they can deliver. If they do not, regrettably, we could refer back to direct rule.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10032376000273"></a>My final point relates to one of the issues that arose in the debates about the transfer of security and policing in Northern Ireland over the past few weeks. What really worried some of us was what would happen if law and order in Northern Ireland collapsed yet again. You cannot rule out that possibility. There is progress and we welcome it, but not everyone wants progress. There are those who are still trying to bring about the collapse of law and order. Certainly, policing in the Newry and South Armagh areas leaves much to be desired. There were recent incidents at Newry court house and one this weekend when rugby supporters could not travel to Dublin because terrorists had blocked the railway line. What happened? There was a suggested bomb. We do not know whether it was a real bomb. The police went to look at it. They had no cover and they were shot at and had to retreat. This is what is happening on the ground, so be warned. What we are deciding today is taking a risk. It is a risk worth taking but it does not guarantee utopia.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10032376000274"></a>The one thing that worried many of us before we finally came down in favour of the devolution of policing and justice was the question of what happens if the civil authority in Northern Ireland yet again fails to control law and order and requires the aid of the military. There was discussion in Ulster broadcast on BBC radio. The Sinn Fein member on the panel was challenged, "Would you, if you had justice and policing transferred to Stormont, call to your aid the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom?" His answer was scary. "We are republicans. Our job is to get the British out of Northern Ireland, not to call them back in". That damaged support for devolution of policing and justice among many people in Northern Ireland because they do not want to be in a position where they could not call on the Army to support the police should there be a collapse in law and order. So I ask the Leader of the House to confirm that, if there is a collapse of law and order, it is a matter for the Chief Constable of the PSNI to take directly to the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and that the Army would

<a name="100323100000001"></a><b><a name="100323-0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100323100000148"></a>Lord Eames:</b> My Lords, we have heard in the speeches that we have just listened to praise for what has been achieved and genuine concerns about how it has been arrived at. Personally, thinking back over the years of my professional life, I have no doubt that this House needs to send out a loud and clear message that, in terms of politics, this is a historic day for the people of Northern Ireland. I think back to the numerous funerals that I have conducted for policemen, members of the Ulster Defence Regiment and civilians, and to the numerous police and Army families whom I have attempted to comfort.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="100323100000002"></a>I am grateful to the Leader of the House for mentioning two names in the run-up to what has been achieved-Albert Reynolds and John Major. I am firmly convinced from having been involved in the preparation of the Downing Street Declaration all those years ago that it was a turning point in the political progress that has brought today about. I pay tribute to those two men. Sometimes history judges them ill when they deserve more. I pay tribute to successive Secretaries of State, not least those who sit in your Lordships' House. I pay tribute to the people, not the politicians alone, in their homes, their work, their streets and their fields, who over the past 30 years have borne the brunt of our disturbances, our troubles and our suffering.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="100323100000003"></a>It would be wrong today to minimise what those who have expressed concerns have said about how today has been reached in political terms. I share the wishes of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that today should mark a point at which healing can take place and that there can be a greater sense of unity in trying to incorporate all political parties in the way ahead. As I said on this subject on a previous occasion, this is a chance to rejoice in political achievement, but political achievement is only part of reconciliation. The real battle, the real challenge and the real problem for Northern Ireland, its Assembly and its people are the hearts and minds of its people. You cannot legislate for reconciliation. You cannot compel people to be reconciled. You can set in place the structure that will make it more encouraging and more possible. We need to send out a message to the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly that they have the good will of this House and of Parliament as they attempt to take on this new dawn that devolution means in political terms.</p>

<a name="100323-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="100323100000004"></a>Members of your Lordships' House who, like me, come from Northern Ireland have been closely involved over the years with what I have described as the suffering of the darkness. We need to recognise the reality of today. To reach this point in political terms has called for great courage by politicians. That is not to dispute the reservations that our noble friend Lord Maginnis expressed, which have to be faced up to and tackled. However, as the Leader of the House and others have said, many, many people have contributed to bring this day about and today is a day when we say: let us be thankful and let us have the faith and courage to move forward.</p>

In fact, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, pointed out, in March 1972 the Ulster Unionist Party led by Prime Minister Brian Faulkner could not accept the removal of policing and justice, which was why the Stormont Parliament was prorogued.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="100323100000006"></a>As the shadow Secretary of State mentioned in another place yesterday, the Ulster Unionist Party had a number of genuine and legitimate concerns about the workings of the Executive as a proper four-party coalition. We were not alone in our frustration. The other party that has Ministers, the SDLP, has similarly expressed dismay at being excluded from the decision-making process. Our current position is that policing and justice are too serious an issue to be transferred to an Assembly and especially an Executive who to date have not shown themselves to be qualified to take on this hugely important responsibility.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="100323100000007"></a>While I recognise that the secret deals of some and the perhaps naive good will of others will bring about the devolution of policing and justice, I cannot understand the means by which the Government have gone about the task. I have spoken to members of the PSNI, members of the Policing Board and others in the legal profession without anyone being able to tell me what the structure of the proposed new arrangements will be. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that planning and preparation should be the essential, fundamental element in this exercise, yet we have seen no evidence that the structures and channels of command and responsibility are in place.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="100323100000008"></a>While we speak of policing and justice in generic terms, it is surely not beyond the realisation of this Government that we have an inefficient Public Prosecution Service, a Prison Service whose members are screaming to have governors replaced and a police service that has yet to establish an effective working relationship with MI5. I am concerned that whereas the Garda Siochana in the Republic appears able to deal effectively with the dissident IRA-catching, charging and sending its members to prison-we do not seem to have similar success in Northern Ireland. It is all very well for the Secretary of State to play around with promises or, indeed, threats regarding the Â£800 million, but we do not know exactly for what that considerable sum is intended.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="100323100000009"></a>Unfortunately, the Northern Ireland Assembly has to date been clearly dysfunctional-with little evidence of corporate responsibility among Ministers, the Executive having been suspended for nearly six months and an Education Minister who is clearly sectarian in her attitude to state education. To date, there has been not a single discussion or even a single word spoken between the Executive members as to how these powers will be executed.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="100323100000010"></a>In conclusion, I ask the Minister exactly what safeguards have been considered and whether they will be implemented before 12 April. Will she explain exactly what will happen on 12 April if the dissident IRA launches a co-ordinated attack on human and economic targets? Surely these issues have been decided.

I declare an interest as the Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the constituency of East Belfast. I welcome the tabling of this Motion and hope that these orders and associated regulations will become law with minimum delay.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="100323100000012"></a>As the House has heard, when the former Northern Ireland Parliament was prorogued in 1972 the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Brian Faulkner, rightly expressed the view that government without policing and justice powers was not worth having at all. These powers were a necessary attribute of government then and remain so today.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="100323100000013"></a>For many years my party has been committed to achieving an agreed administrative structure that would facilitate the return of policing and justice powers to a local assembly and I am firmly convinced that the necessary conditions for such a transfer have now been met. First, the commitment by Sinn Fein to give its support to the police, the courts and the rule of law as a condition of its entry into government is of great significance, particularly since it has given practical effect to this commitment by playing a role as members of the Policing Board and district policing partnerships. Secondly, the order incorporates clear safeguards against political interference in policing and judicial decisions. The chief constable will continue to enjoy operational independence and the Public Prosecution Service and judiciary will remain entirely free of political influence. As a result, the whole community in Northern Ireland, and in particular the unionist electorate, can have full confidence that the impartiality of the police and judiciary will not be compromised.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="100323100000014"></a>In these circumstances, the return of these natural governmental functions to locally elected and locally accountable politicians seems an eminently logical step. For this reason it is surprising to say the least that not all Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly saw fit to support our prayer for a change in the relevant legislation. In particular, the unwavering opposition of the Ulster Unionist Party is frankly baffling. Members of that party supported the devolution of policing and justice powers in 2003 when neither of the conditions that I have described had been met. Moreover, the leader of that party has reaffirmed his support in principle for the transfer of powers but bases his opposition on an assertion that the Executive are dysfunctional. Clearly his opposition, far from facilitating more efficient functioning, is likely to promote exactly the opposite outcome. It is indeed significant that the last Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs, the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, has questioned the rationale for the Ulster Unionist stance. All things considered, one might be forgiven for concluding that it may have its origin in seeking merely party political advantage.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="100323100000017"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Maginnis that it is now 25 years since I first visited him in his constituency in Fermanagh and South Tyrone when I was a spokesman in another place. I had huge admiration for him then which continues to this day. The trenchant, no-nonsense fashion in which he speaks is not to be ignored in your Lordships' House, and I agree with the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames: he represents an opinion that is held in the north of Ireland, and one to which we should listen with some care. For instance, he said that there is great disaffection with the Public Prosecution Service. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, has supported that view and we should certainly take it into account.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="100323100000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, also said that justice delayed is justice denied. He was in fact quoting Mr Gladstone, who said precisely that. Maybe it is worth recalling that it was the same Mr Gladstone who, after the Home Rule Bill was defeated in your Lordships' House more than a century ago, mused that the one and only conspicuous failure of our political genius had been the failure to achieve a political solution in Northern Ireland. Although recent events serve to remind us that there are still paramilitary forces in Northern Ireland which would like to destroy political progress, it will surely be said of these past 15 years that British and Irish politicians and civil servants at last deployed their considerable genius in trying to find a peaceful way out of the mire. Again, I agree with the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames, who said it is a historic day for Northern Ireland and we should rejoice in political achievement.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="100323100000019"></a>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s I regularly spoke in another place on Northern Ireland issues. Indeed, my maiden speech in 1979 was made in the immediate aftermath of the tragic murder of Airey Neave in the precincts of the House by the INLA. I remarked that day that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="100323100000127"></a>"The bullet can never replace the ballot in a free society".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/4/1979; col. 1222.]</p>

<p><a name="100323100000122"></a>Although the INLA has now renounced violence, it will take many more years for memories to heal. My maiden speech in your Lordships' House in 1997 returned to the importance of finding a political strategy for ending decades of violence. I said that a way forward could never be based on anything which implied a victory for either side and suggested that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="100323100000128"></a>"An end to this catalogue of violence remains the elusive prize which will reward the patience and perseverance of those constructively engaged in the present negotiations".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/10/1997; col.773.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="100323100000020"></a>The orders before your Lordships' House today will enable the completion of devolution in Northern Ireland through the transfer of policing and justice powers to Stormont, exactly as my noble friend Lord Kilclooney said a few minutes ago. In turn, they give effect to the historic vote at Stormont on 9 March. That is a

Tribute should also be paid, as others have done, to Sir John Major, Mr Tony Blair, Albert Reynolds, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, who is in his seat today, and all those who have invested so heavily in creating this constructive way forward.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="100323100000021"></a>This has not been an easy time for the right honourable Member for East Belfast, Mr Peter Robinson, the First Minister. We both entered the Commons 30 years ago, and I have watched with admiration as he has grappled with the complexities posed by a devolved, power-sharing assembly. Speaking in yesterday's debate in another place, he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="100323100000132"></a>"zero-sum politics-sectarian politics-drag Northern Ireland down and back. We must recognise that it is possible to find a way forward in Northern Ireland that is a win-win solution, and that it is possible to have agreements on how we move forward in Northern Ireland that attracts the support of both Nationalist and Unionists. The devolution of policing and justice is such an issue. For 100 years, Unionists' policy has been to have devolved powers over policing and justice".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/3/10; col. 70.]</ul>
<a name="100323-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="100323100000022"></a>He was also right to support the view of the honourable Member for Foyle, Mark Durkan, who spoke on behalf of the SDLP of not making the perfect the enemy of the good. He said that in Northern Ireland, as elsewhere:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="100323100000129"></a>"We cannot make perfection a precondition for progress".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/3/10; col. 54.]</p>

<p><a name="100323100000123"></a>I agree with that view and believe that it builds constructively on the fine work undertaken by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, his noble friend Lord Kilclooney, Mr John Hume and many others who have been involved in the process. Yesterday's vote made it a historic day in another place, because the debate there saw the swan songs of two significant figures in Northern Ireland's affairs. I will mention them briefly before concluding my remarks.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="100323100000023"></a>The honourable Member for South Staffordshire, Sir Patrick Cormack, has played a remarkable role as chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee. I know that Members on all sides of your Lordships' House who have followed these issues over the years will want to pay tribute to him for his patient and constructive role in bringing about this political achievement.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="100323100000024"></a>I particularly want to mention the Reverend Ian Paisley, the Member of Parliament for North Antrim. He spoke yesterday in another place, and the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, said how moved she had been to hear his words. These were some of those words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="100323100000130"></a>"The day has come when Northern Ireland must boldly face the simple facts. There are people in Northern Ireland who have diverse religious and political convictions, but they can live together as neighbours. When I was a boy, there was more neighbourliness than we have seen for many years. Something entered the hearts of the people that destroyed the reverence for neighbourliness and kindliness. The Ulster people are not a hard people: they are a loving and caring people. I am glad that there is no disturbance in the House today. We are meeting here in calm and peace, because that calm and peace is slowly but surely being established in Northern Ireland. We are making progress in the right direction".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/3/10; col. 67.]</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_891"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 891</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="100323100000124"></a>I pay tribute to the right honourable Member. I always believed that he could become the catalyst for change in Northern Ireland. We offer him and the noble Baroness, Lady Paisley, who is in her seat today, our good wishes for their future.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="100323100000025"></a>Devolution brings with it many opportunities and laurels. The Â£800 million of extra resources have been mentioned. All but Â£26 million-2 per cent-of the Northern Ireland Office's current baseline budget will transfer to the Northern Ireland Executive, as will the entire Northern Ireland Court Service baseline budget. That is a huge responsibility, as the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said, but it is also a huge opportunity. Secondly, there will be a more effective and integrated Executive. Thirdly, there will be consolidation of the political infrastructure of Northern Ireland. Fourthly, a message will be sent to dissident elements that progress is made via dialogue and political action, not by murdering police officers or killing your neighbours.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="100323100000026"></a>The legacy of the past 40 years in Northern Ireland is almost 3,000 unsolved murders. The families of the victims of those terrible atrocities will want to hear an assurance that the passing of these orders will underline, and not in any way minimise, the importance of ensuring that those responsible are held to account. I welcome the renunciation of violence that so many have made, but they must also understand that justice is not a process by which the past is forgotten. I have never subscribed to the view that we should simply forgive and forget. No one can forgive on behalf of others. It is better to forgive and remember, for if we too easily forget what has gone before, the sacrifices and the gains will be placed in jeopardy.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="100323100000027"></a>I have some brief questions for the Minister. First, how will these orders affect the Policing Board's relationship with the chief constable and the Department of Justice? Is she confident that the impartiality and operational independence of the chief constable will not be compromised? That point was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="100323100000028"></a>Secondly, what progress is being made on the draft Bill on parades and how will the consultation process work? Thirdly, is there a date for the publication of the Saville inquiry's report? What provision will be made in your Lordships' House to debate its findings? My fourth point concerns the intelligence agencies and was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Rogan. Mr Mark Durkan raised what he called the,</p>
<ul><a name="100323100000133"></a>"dangerous twilight zone that exists in relation to the interface between national security, the regional policing interest and the full accountability of devolution".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/3/10; col. 52.]</ul>
<p><a name="100323100000125"></a>Can the Minister describe what role Parliament will have in these matters? Will Northern Ireland Members of your Lordships' House be offered seats on Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee?</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="100323100000029"></a>Fifthly and finally, I turn to the sunset clause. The Prime Minister has said that these orders represent an end to decades of strife. Would it not have been better, therefore, to dispense with a sunset clause-to be applied in May 2012-and which could open up these wounds all over again?</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_892"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 892</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="100323100000030"></a>These orders are not perfect, but they are a victory for common sense. In a period of political turbulence, Northern Ireland needs a sense of stability. At a time when the public have a low view of politicians, it is good to be reminded of what coherent and dedicated political engagement can achieve. Other troubled parts of the world regularly look to Northern Ireland for encouragement as they seek to resolve their difficulties and conflicts. I hope that, as the years pass, the wonderful people of Northern Ireland will be able to show us how they used their genius to solve what had eluded us for so long.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="100323100000032"></a>I will speak to only one point at the heart of her initial speech. Other noble Lords have also referred to it. It is the issue of the independence of the chief constable. It may seem a technical difficulty with the new arrangements, but it is a very real one. Mr Peter Smith QC, a member of the Patten commission, and Mr Alex Attwood of the SDLP, have in recent months been in the van of the argument for police reform in Northern Ireland. When one recalls that in recent months they have raised issues about the new protocols, and concerns about whether the independence of the chief constable will be preserved, one realises that there is an issue here.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="100323100000033"></a>In particular, there is a political issue that no Government can resolve, namely the need for Sinn Fein to present the devolution of policing and justice as, in Mr Adams's words, a staging post towards a united Ireland. That might seem rather a strained way of viewing the replacement of Mr Paul Goggins of New Labour by Mr Ford of the Alliance Party. It seems a grand interpretation of what looks like a relatively small political event, but none the less that language is out there and it conditions the debate. There is nothing that the Government can do about that. However, there are fundamentally crucial new technical questions that arise from these new arrangements.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="100323100000034"></a>The Serious Organised Crime Agency will remain responsible to London, not to the devolved institutions. So will the intelligence services in Northern Ireland. The noble Baroness referred to the issue in her opening remarks as the interface. Very helpfully, she pointed out that where technical difficulties of competence arise, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, will have a role. That is very reassuring to the many Members of this House who have enormous respect for the acumen that the noble Lord brings to these issues.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="100323100000035"></a>None the less, there will be problems. I will give one simple example of a crowd scene and a riot in Northern Ireland. There surely will be another riot in Northern Ireland some day soon. The chief constable will have a responsibility to deal with the aftermath in public with the Minister of Justice. However, let us say there is a shooting in the crowd and terrorists are involved.  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_893"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 893</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There will be issues of terrorist activity, of intercepts in relation to that activity, and of the role of the intelligence services. It is a very clear cut example of the ways in which we now have a very messy situation to which, at this point, no one has answers. The two things are caught up-the responsibility of the chief constable for national security and the responsibility of the chief constable to the local devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="100323100000036"></a>It is for that reason that I repeat a point which the noble Baroness has listened to many times and patiently responded to many times regarding the Government's support for the independence of the chief constable. I ask her to do so one more time if only because, given the difficult times ahead, it cannot be put on the record too often. With the noble Lord, Lord Alton, I also ask about the parliamentary scrutiny of these new issues as they arise. A new space of contestation has been created and the chief constable faces a new difficulty; he will have to face towards two different authorities in his operation, and the job becomes that much more difficult. We must do everything possible to help the chief constable carry out his duties professionally.</p>

I pay tribute to all those who have worked over the years to secure this, and in so doing I pay tribute to people with whom I would have had very little sympathy. I pay tribute to those who have moved the republican movement from what it called the armed struggle to what we have now. I also acknowledge the pain and suffering of all those who have suffered at the hands of actors of the state who have behaved as they should not have behaved. We have had reference already to the inquiry of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Saville, and to the fact that the report of that inquiry will be delayed. I do not think that I can say any more about the noble and learned Lord, Lord Saville, now, but I will in future.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="100323100000038"></a>For the past 12 years many people have played politics with our peace and our security in Northern Ireland. As we speak that continues, and the sectarianism continues. Neither the DUP nor Sinn Fein is prepared to allow the application of the d'Hondt principles to provide a Justice Minister. The parties that occupy the offices of First Minister and Deputy First Minister will not allow it and the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP, which sits outside, is not allowed to hold the office of Jusitce Minister. They are therefore determined that they will elect the leader of the Alliance Party to this ministry. In so doing they are electing someone who has publicly said that the Saville inquiry is pointless. The Saville inquiry was established by the British Government to establish exactly what happened on that terrible day in Derry. That causes me great concern about the proposed Minister for Justice's understanding of matters of justice.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="100323100000039"></a>I should, however, like to address the substance of my remarks to the issue of national security. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, has already referred to the fact that the chief constable will effectively face a dual responsibility to the Justice Minister and to the Home Secretary. I want to say a word about national security  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_894"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 894</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because, in Northern Ireland terms, "national security" refers only to the activities of republican terrorists and not to the activities of other terrorists who are active in Northern Ireland and who emanate, if you like, from Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100323-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="100323100000040"></a>Previous experience has shown that terrorists who were working in both republican and loyalist communities were recruited as informants to the intelligence services and particularly to the Special Branch of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That led to the situation in which intelligence informants were able to engage in the most serious of crimes without being made amenable for those crimes. Those crimes included murder, attempted murder, arson, kidnapping, extortion, and all the things that go on under the cloak of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. It is said that it is necessary for informants to be engaged in crime so that they can produce information for the security and policing services. To a degree, that is undoubtedly true; they will be closer to those who are engaged in serious crime. However, the reality is that the United Kingdom has serious controls over the activities of informants and that those controls were not observed by the Royal Ulster Constabulary during all those years.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="100323100000041"></a>The introduction of a surveillance commissioner, in an attempt to regulate the process of informant handling and management, was a welcome development. However, what happened in Northern Ireland continued to happen notwithstanding the role of the surveillance commissioner, who was unable to identify what was happening in the situation. In essence he could not identify the level of criminality in which those informants were involved, and he accepted the assertion that they were not currently involved in crime-which I was told by a police officer meant "at this moment they are not committing a crime". This was misleading the surveillance commissioner.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="100323100000042"></a>Primacy has now moved to MI5, where many former Special Branch officers are employed. It is vital that in the exercise of his functions the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, will be more effective than the surveillance commissioner was in managing these issues. Lessons must be learned not only from the successes of the Royal Ulster Constabulary but also from the failures of that organisation.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="100323100000043"></a>I want to say something about the Â£800 million which I think needs to be said. The Â£800 million reflects the amount needed to make justice and policing in some measure fit for purpose in Northern Ireland. Over the decades many compromises have been made in the management of policing, justice and the prisons. It has left us with a situation in which we have many unresolved problems, several of which have been referred to today-the dysfunction in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the serious dysfunction in the Prison Service, and many other problems which arise in the operation of our probation service and things like that. There will be significant challenges for the new Ministry of Justice, but there will also be significant challenges for each of us as we seek to give our consent and our support to the activities of that ministry. There can be no more further playing politics in these matters.</p>

I call on all those-obviously not noble Lords-who have any information about the whereabouts of the disappeared. More have disappeared than are formally acknowledged to have been disappeared. I call on people to give this information so that others can lay their loved ones to rest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="100323100000046"></a>First, however, my excellent Bill team tells me that when I spoke of the Northern Ireland Court Service (Abolition and Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2010, I suggested that it establishes the Northern Ireland Court Service whereas, of course, it abolishes it.

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="100323100000047"></a>This will be the last opportunity that we have in this House to debate substantive policing and justice matters before those matters are devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 12 April. Noble Lords from all sides of the House have made an enormous contribution to the political process in Northern Ireland-and I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, is in his place. That spirit of co-operation has been entirely in evidence today as we celebrate the completion of the process of devolution to the Northern Ireland Assembly.

I know that that is a matter of concern for many noble Lords. I entirely agree that there are a number of issues which still require resolution, and this is recognised by the Northern Ireland parties themselves, two of which are represented here today. That is why the Hillsborough Castle agreement made provision for a number of working groups to look at the working of the Executive and other outstanding issues. I am sure that we all welcome the fact that Sir Reg Empey and Margaret Ritchie are chairing one of these groups, and we all look forward to the outcomes.</p>

However, I believe that with the working party looking into these matters, and the fact that all the powers have now been devolved, the Executive can now really focus its attention, without distraction, on the issues which are perhaps of most importance to the people of Northern Ireland today-issues such as education.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="100323100000051"></a>We need to have a clear focus on 2012. The parties have demonstrated their willingness and desire to make devolution work and their ability to work together to overcome difficult issues. There is work to be done before 1 May 2012, but I am optimistic, as I am sure most noble Lords are, that this work can and will be taken forward in a spirit of co-operation.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="100323100000052"></a>Several noble Lords have spoken of security issues. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, and the noble Baroness, Lady O'Loan, were right to point out that there will be problems. New technical questions will arise with this new process. However, the fact that in the protocol we have details of how the national security interface will work is helpful, and the position of the independent reviewer, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, is key. He will help the people of Northern Ireland to work through the various problems.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="100323100000053"></a>Many noble Lords have spoken about the chief constable and the judiciary and the importance of their independence. I fully endorse the comments of the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Browne of Belmont, on the independence of the chief constable and the judiciary. The fundamental principle that the police are impartial and free from political control is enshrined in legislation and was underlined in the Good Friday agreement and the Patten report. We wholly endorse the principle of judicial independence in Northern Ireland as well as in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is recognised in statute and it will be underpinned by the concordat by the Northern Ireland Executive and the other bodies.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="100323100000054"></a>On the reporting of the chief constable, he is operationally responsible but accountable to the Secretary of State in respect of those of his functions which touch on national security. As for his other functions, he of course reports to the Policing Board. I hope that that is clear.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="100323100000055"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked what would happen if there was a request for military support, should circumstances change. As I said, the chief constable has operational responsibility and operational independence, and it would therefore be for him to decide whether military support was required. The accountability for operational matters is to the Policing Board, and on operational matters he has primacy.</p>

Can it be clarified that, if a situation develops in Northern Ireland and the civil authority requires the support of the Army, the chief constable will go directly to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who will then consult with the Secretary of State for Defence, and that the Minister of Justice in the devolved institution will not be involved in that decision?</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="100323100000131"></a>"The decision to request military support would obviously require detailed discussions with the Policing Board, and I would not do it without raising the issues with the Minister of Justice because I think it is appropriate to do that. I work as an operational chief constable in a democracy, in a tripartite system between a Minister of Justice, a Policing Board and myself, and that is entirely appropriate".</p>

<p><a name="100323100000126"></a>Those are his words.</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="100323100000058"></a><b><a name="100323-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100323100000157"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I regret that decision. It is the decision of the chief constable, and not of the Government. This is a very serious matter, because you could have a Minister of Justice from Sinn Fein, and as they have already said there is no way in which they want to bring back the British Army into Northern Ireland on an operational basis. Their job is to get rid of the British Army, not to bring it back.</p>

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="100323100000059"></a><b><a name="100323-0009.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100323100000158"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I understand the seriousness of this issue and the concern expressed by the noble Lord. Going back to the quotation, the chief constable has said that he would not do it without raising the issues with the Minister of Justice, but I do not think that that would necessarily bind him. He has operational independence, so if he felt that it was necessary to seek assistance from the security services or from the Army, I am confident that he would do so without being bound by the views of the Minister of Justice.</p>

When the military were operating in Northern Ireland, there was legislation which enabled them to do so. Therefore, if the chief constable wishes to bring them back in anything other than bomb disposal, there would need to be legislation. Therefore, the chief constable could surely not do it off his own bat.</p>

I will return to it shortly if I may. The noble Lord, Lord Rogan, asked what would happen on 12 April if dissident republicans launched an attack on civilian targets. In the event of such attacks, the police and security agencies will of course respond accordingly. National security will remain an excepted matter, as we have said many times, and the responsibility of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will continue to be answerable here, in Parliament, for arrangements for safeguarding national security.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="100323100000062"></a>The noble Viscount asked whether legislation would be necessary to enable the military to operate. Legislation is already in place in the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="100323100000063"></a>I rather liked the description by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, of the devolution of policing and justice as the cementing of the peace process. As she said, it is indeed an opportunity for leadership in the Assembly and in Northern Ireland. Several noble Lords have lamented the lack of leadership in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and I suggest that the time has come for leadership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="100323100000064"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, expressed many trenchant views, and I assure the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that I heed the views of the noble Lord. I do not think that the noble Lord would wish or expect me to address directly his remarks about my noble friends. The important thing is that we have reached an agreement, and it is now time to look to the future, as the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, said, and to the fulfilment of the Belfast agreement.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="100323100000065"></a>The noble Lord made various remarks about the Â£800 million that is being made available in the context of devolution. I respect his views, but I think that the people of Northern Ireland will be very happy to have that generous amount of money to assist them in the transformation in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="100323100000066"></a>The noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady O'Loan, mentioned the Saville report. I note their views, but I refer them to yesterday's Written Ministerial Statement on the report's publication.</p>

No one will be unhappy about money coming to Northern Ireland, but we all need to know whether the Secretary of State was prepared to deny this money to the people of Northern Ireland. Was it bribery, or was it blackmail? A straightforward answer would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="100323100000068"></a><b><a name="100323-0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="100323100000162"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I think most noble Lords would agree that it was neither bribery nor blackmail. The Prime Minister reached agreement last October that that amount of money would go to Northern Ireland to ensure that policing and justice could be devolved appropriately and that the people of Northern Ireland had the requisite money for that. It was neither bribery, nor blackmail; it was part of an agreement.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="100323100000069"></a>The noble Lord also spoke of the failures of the PPS in higher profile cases. Of overarching importance is the need for a defendant to receive a fair trial. The difficulties in the trials which he mentioned are not exclusive to Northern Ireland; similar difficulties arise in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="100323100000070"></a>The noble Baroness said that perhaps the appointment of the Justice Minister was the result of playing politics with a piece of Northern Ireland. As we all know, the Justice Minister will be nominated by a Member of the Assembly and elected on a cross-community vote, which reflects the November 2008 agreement between the First and Deputy First Ministers that was endorsed by the AERC in its January 2009 report.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="100323100000071"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, raised the interesting issue of the address of the Independent Monitoring Commission and Stormont House. I understand that there were security considerations. In any event, the address is not necessary in the drafting of the order. Stormont House is currently the headquarters of the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast, and it will continue to be so after the devolution of policing and justice. My right honourable friend needs a base in Belfast for the functions that he will continue to perform. The devolved Administration will control almost all the premises on the Stormont estate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="100323100000074"></a>Stormont Castle is not the base of the Secretary of State; Stormont House is. Therefore, we can conclude that the Secretary of State will retain Stormont House but not Stormont Castle. Have I got that wrong? Oh God.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked for an update on parading. As we know, the agreement at Hillsborough outlined a route map to finding and implementing a new and improved framework for regulating and adjudicating on parading. A working group was established that has brought forward proposals, and the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister will bring forward for consultation later this month a draft Bill that seeks to implement those agreed outcomes. The Bill will be introduced to the Assembly in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="100323100000078"></a>The noble Lord asked about the security and intelligence agencies and the interface with the role of Parliament. The Security Service remains accountable to Parliament through existing oversight arrangements that were established under the Security Service Act 1989, the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Three groups of commissioners oversee current work in Northern Ireland: the intelligence services commissioner, the interception of communications commissioner and the surveillance commissioner. The Intelligence and Security Committee will continue to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the security and intelligence agencies and to report to Parliament. The Secretary of State remains responsible for national security issues, and the public can raise issues with representatives in this House and in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="100323100000081"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Loan, spoke about informants who were involved in crime. The security and intelligence agencies do not sanction the activities of any informants in criminal activities.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="100323100000082"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, also raised the issue of the sunset clause. As set out in the Northern Ireland Act 2009, the Department of Justice will dissolve on 1 May, unless the Assembly has resolved on a cross-community basis to continue the current model for appointing the Justice Minister, or passed an act to put in place alternative arrangements. When Parliament passed this legislation in March 2009, it was aware that these arrangements reflected the agreement between the First and Deputy First Ministers that the arrangement set out in their November 2008 statement should be time-limited to come to an end in May 2012. Work is clearly needed to agree the post-2012 arrangements, but the parties, both at Hillsborough Castle and more recently, have demonstrated their willingness and desire to make devolution work, as well as their ability to work together to overcome difficult issues.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="100323100000083"></a>The vote in the Assembly on 9 March marked a watershed moment for Northern Ireland. The noble and right reverend Lord is right when he says that this is an historic day. That was an historic agreement, and I wholeheartedly endorse his comments on reconciliation in Northern Ireland. I commend him for his work on this issue.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="100323100000084"></a>Throughout the political process, the Government have been clear that responsibility for policing and justice matters should properly lie with the Northern Ireland Assembly. We have maintained that those politicians making decisions on policing and justice matters in Northern Ireland should be directly accountable to the people of Northern Ireland. We have also maintained, however, that the Assembly should only take on those responsibilities when it decided that it was ready to do so. When the Assembly decided on 9 March that it was ready to take on those responsibilities, it was clear that the political process in Northern Ireland had matured.</p>

<a name="100323-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="100323100000085"></a>The transfer of powers which will take place on 12 April will mark another watershed. From 12 April, the Assembly will be able to completely focus on those issues which affect the people of Northern Ireland on a day-to-day basis. Jobs, health, investment, education, and now law and order will be in the hands of locally accountable politicians. This can only benefit the people of Northern Ireland, and it can only help to secure the political stability that we have worked so hard to achieve. I think we should rejoice today, and I am delighted to commend the Motion.</p>

The warming of the global climate is unequivocal and the role of human activities in the observed changes is now more apparent than ever. There is no doubt that climate change remains the biggest global threat to mankind. That is why the UK introduced a statutory target of an 80 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 and backed this up with a system of legally binding carbon budgets to help us to achieve that target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="100323100000087"></a>The <I>UK </I><I>Low Carbon Transition Plan</I>, published in July last year, sets out measures to deliver carbon emission cuts of 18 per cent on 2008 levels by 2020. As we transition to a low-carbon future, we need to ensure secure energy supplies. This means ensuring a supportive climate for the substantial new investment needed to bring forward the new infrastructure required for a low-carbon future. It means maximising the potential of our remaining oil and gas resources while

It means delivering the low-carbon trinity of renewables, nuclear and clean coal, all three of which are needed if we are to achieve our overall emissions reduction targets.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="100323100000088"></a>Last year we published our renewable energy strategy, setting out the path for us to meet our legally binding target to ensure that 15 per cent of our energy comes from renewable sources by 2020. The Office for Nuclear Development is taking active steps to establish and cement the right framework and conditions in the UK for investment in new nuclear with the aim of having new nuclear power stations generating electricity from around 2018. To promote the development and deployment of clean coal, we have committed to one of the most ambitious demonstration programmes in the world and have taken the unprecedented step for a coal-dependent country of saying no new coal without CCS.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="100323100000089"></a>The energy markets continue to have a critical role to play in delivering this transition to a low-carbon future. However, left to their own devices they would not bring forward the necessary investment that we need. We need a robust framework that will deliver on investment but also deliver a fair deal for consumers.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="100323100000090"></a>This Energy Bill sets out measures in three key areas that are central to the task that we face: delivering investment in clean coal technology; delivering a mandatory requirement to provide help with energy bills to more of the most vulnerable; and delivering a more robust framework for consumer protection.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="100323100000091"></a>The first part of the Bill mainly relates to the new carbon capture and storage incentive. Coal is the fuel with the highest carbon emissions but it is also a low-cost and reliable fuel for power generation with abundant remaining reserves. Clean coal, as part of the trinity of low-carbon energy, will provide diversity and flexibility in our energy mix. However, for clean coal to take its place in our long-term energy mix, we need to demonstrate at a commercial level the technologies required to capture, transport and store the carbon emissions created by coal-fired power stations.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="100323100000092"></a>Clauses 1 to 4 provide the framework, through a new CCS incentive, to deliver financial support for our commitment to deliver four commercial-scale CCS demonstration projects on coal-fired power stations. These projects will encompass both pre-combustion and post-combustion capture technologies. The framework will also allow, should it be needed, support to be provided for the retrofit of CCS to the remaining unabated capacity of these projects. The funding will be raised by a new levy on electricity supplies used solely to support these CCS demonstration projects. The collection of the levy and the payment of the incentive to the projects will be administered by Ofgem. The selection of projects, however, will be carried out by the Government.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="100323100000093"></a>The second part of the Bill focuses on tackling fuel poverty through helping more of the most vulnerable with their energy bills. There are three main factors in fuel poverty: household income, energy prices and energy efficiency. We are taking action on all three of them. To help household incomes, winter fuel and  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_903"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 903</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cold weather payments are currently at their highest levels since introduction. To help householders to improve their energy efficiency, we have ensured, through policies such as CERT and Warm Front, that 7.5 million homes have received loft or cavity wall insulation since 2002. The <I>Warm Homes, Greener Homes </I>strategy, which was launched on 2 March, announced our intention to ensure that all households are able to benefit from loft and cavity wall insulation by 2015, where practical, and to offer up to 7 million eco-upgrades by 2020.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="100323100000094"></a>Clauses 9 to 15 introduce a framework for mandatory social price support to tackle the third factor: energy prices. The current voluntary agreement between the Government and energy companies has provided support to over 1 million customer accounts in the first year alone. The provisions in the Bill will build on this agreement, allowing the Government to require energy suppliers to help more of the most vulnerable consumers with their energy bills.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="100323100000095"></a>In last year's Pre-Budget Report, we announced that suppliers would collectively be required to spend Â£300 million per year on social price support by 2013-14. This is double the amount that they have agreed to spend in the final year of the voluntary agreement. The powers in the Bill will also allow us to give greater direction on the types of household that are eligible for support and ensure that more of the available resources are targeted at those households that are most in need. Ofgem will monitor the operation of the scheme and energy suppliers' compliance with it.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="100323100000096"></a>It is fundamental to the policy that suppliers' contributions are proportionate to their market share. This will ensure that no supplier is disadvantaged by having a higher number of households eligible for support and therefore that vulnerable customers do not become unattractive to those suppliers. Clauses 11 and 12 provide the Government with the power to set up a reconciliation mechanism to allow the costs of a mandatory social price scheme to be distributed fairly between energy suppliers.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="100323100000097"></a>The third part of the Bill will protect consumers through improved regulation of the energy markets. Although Ofgem's principal objective remains the protection of the interests of existing and future consumers, Clauses 16 and 17 clarify that these interests include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the delivery of secure energy supplies. It is important that Ofgem makes decisions within a framework that protects the interests of consumers in the widest sense.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="100323100000098"></a>These clauses also clarify that, while the promotion of competition remains the foundation of consumer protection in the long term, the regulator should also take steps proactively to protect the consumer interest. In essence, the Bill makes it clear that, where consumer interests are threatened, Ofgem must consider measures other than the promotion of competition in order to rectify the situation. Such measures might include more stringent enforcement of existing licence conditions or the introduction of new licence obligations.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="100323100000099"></a>Clauses 18 to 23 introduce a market power licence condition. This will allow Ofgem to tackle situations specific to the electricity balancing market, where  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_904"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 904</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>companies may take advantage of constrained electricity capacity. It is targeted to eliminate those circumstances in which the licence holder might use market power to obtain excessive benefits by unduly exploiting balancing arrangements with National Grid, the system operator. The costs of this exploitation are ultimately passed on to the consumer. This measure is subject to a sunset clause, which means that this licence condition can be in place for a maximum of seven years. We believe that this is sufficient, as the lack of transmission capacity, which is the root cause of this type of market exploitation, should be resolved by ongoing upgrades to the transmission system. We expect these upgrades to be completed by 2018.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="100323100000100"></a>Clause 24 extends the time limit within which Ofgem can impose financial penalties on energy suppliers for a breach of licence conditions from 12 months to five years. This will enhance Ofgem's ability to protect consumer interests by ensuring that in future it is able to address more cases where licensees may have breached licence conditions and to take appropriate enforcement action.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="100323100000101"></a>Clauses 26 to 29 give the Government the power to adjust charges for gas and electricity in situations where energy suppliers treat certain customers less favourably than others according to the type of energy supplied. An example is where electricity-only customers are paying significantly higher prices than dual-fuel customers for which there is no justification in cost differentials. The Government already have similar powers to tackle such situations in the gas and electricity markets separately, but they cannot currently address situations where consumers are being disadvantaged through cross-subsidies. We have no immediate intention of using these powers, as Ofgem introduced a new licence condition last September to tackle this type of consumer detriment. However, it is important to have the power to tackle all situations where consumers are disadvantaged in case Ofgem cannot take appropriate action.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="100323100000102"></a>This Bill was the subject of detailed scrutiny in the other place. Following discussions during its Committee stage, several amendments were proposed and accepted. Through this, the scope of the CCS incentive was extended to allow it to be used to support the demonstration of CCS on gas-fired power should this be required in the future. However, I must make it clear that it remains our intention to deliver four demonstration projects on coal-fired power stations as our first priority. A new requirement was also introduced for the Government to report every three years, starting in 2012, on progress towards the decarbonisation of the electricity sector. These reports will set out progress in the decarbonisation of coal-fired power stations and progress in the development and use of CCS technology.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="100323100000103"></a>We have taken powers to allow the Government to set the period within which energy companies must inform customers of changes to their gas and electricity tariffs. This period is currently set at 65 working days, a length of time that is clearly unacceptable. Ofgem has committed to addressing the issue and will publish a consultation before Easter. In the event that Ofgem encounters difficulties, it is important that the Government have the ability to step in and remedy the situation.

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="100323100000104"></a>Taking the measures in this Energy Bill together, we believe that they will play an important part in achieving our transition to a low-carbon economy. They will help to reduce our carbon emissions, to secure our energy markets and to provide support to the most vulnerable consumers in our society. I commend the Bill to the House and I beg to move.</p>

As far as it goes, we welcome it. Most of what is in the Bill is long overdue and I do not think that it would have caused us too much trouble even if we were to have had sufficient time to discuss it in detail in Committee. I am naturally pleased to see the two meaningful concessions that were extracted from the Government in another place by my honourable friends Greg Clark and Charles Hendry.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="100323100000106"></a>What would have engaged our interest in this Bill is what is not included. This is a common complaint against Labour's energy policy. It took years before Labour faced up to the energy crisis that was developing under it and even now it is proceeding too timidly to address the issue successfully.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="100323100000107"></a>It is no surprise that, at Second Reading in another place, the debate barely touched on what was in the Bill and instead involved Labour Back-Benchers quizzing my honourable friends on the Conservative energy policy. I am glad to say to any noble Lords in this House who share that interest that we recently published a strategy paper and a detailed Green Paper setting out the urgent actions that we would implement if we were fortunate enough to win in the imminent election.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="100323100000108"></a>Unfortunately, there is a complete lack of any corresponding policy from the Front Bench opposite. As far as I can see, Labour's energy policy has, over the years, moved from lack of interest to outright denial and, finally, in the past couple of years, to the sort of dithering that we have come to expect when major decisions have become unavoidable.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="100323100000109"></a>It is clear that our country and our people, especially the disadvantaged, have been failed by Labour over energy, according to its own targets. The most vulnerable people are being expected to wait even longer to hear how Labour would ensure that they will be able to afford to heat their homes. Our businesses, too, which are already suffering from a great recession because of the mismanagement of the economy, are given nothing to indicate under what conditions they are expected to make the necessary long-term investment. The City hesitates because this Bill gives no certainty to anyone.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="100323100000110"></a>However, finally we have some measures before us that allow for the subsidy of carbon capture and storage. That is to be welcomed, but there is no detail on how the levy will be imposed and no criteria for how the money will be spent. This Government, who have accepted, at the final hour, that CCS needs some sort of government subsidy, appear determined to leave all questions on the subject to be answered by the next Government. Noble Lords may rest assured that,  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_906"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 906</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>if the next Government are Conservative, it will not be long before those questions are answered. Within six months, we will set out how the EPS will be introduced. Without such a standard, the money raised by this levy could be frittered away with no result, as the Government have done with the revenue from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme instead of contributing to a secure, sustainable energy supply.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="100323100000111"></a>On energy security, the Government, despite the Minister's valiant recent efforts in the still relatively new department of DECC, which brought him and me together, have again failed to come forward with what is needed. There is nothing in the Bill about gas storage, despite Labour's acknowledgment that we have totally inadequate facilities for this country's needs. On fuel poverty, we have the same inadequate provisions. Of course, we welcome what is here, in Part 2 of the Bill. Given that the Government have failed to meet their own targets on fuel poverty, these clauses are now very necessary, but it is disappointing that, despite a few recent indications that Labour is finally starting to listen to us on the importance of energy efficiency, there is nothing to introduce a genuine green deal for households. The Government's plans for a pilot scheme covering 500 households are pitiful in comparison to the promises that we have made in this area in our document, which I hope all noble Lords will read.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="100323100000112"></a>Indeed, the Bill says very little about the day-to-day experience of the consumer. The Government conceded a point in another place about information on pricing changes. However, without the necessary detail in Part 1 about whom the levy will be imposed on and without a genuine engagement with households in Part 2 on how to reduce and manage their energy requirements, consumers appear to be left holding all the costs of the necessary investment with no guarantees regarding the benefits that they might expect to receive.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="100323100000113"></a>Much of the public's scepticism about green investment could be addressed with proper transparency around energy pricing and subsidy. When newspapers report the record profits made by energy suppliers while households struggle to meet their bills, it is critical that every household can feel confident that it is, at least, on the most appropriate tariff for its needs. With the baffling complexity of Labour's subsidy mechanisms causing problems even for the experts, the consumer must be informed of the amount of money that he or she is paying into this sector.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="100323100000114"></a>It is understandable why Labour is so hesitant to introduce such transparency. It has achieved so little in its time in government that there would be a public outcry if it were better appreciated how much taxpayer money has been wasted. Labour refuses to commit to an emissions performance standard, making it uncertain that investment will bear any better results in the future and, unsurprisingly, it refuses to give consumers the necessary means to see the consequences themselves.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="100323100000115"></a>As far as the Bill goes, we welcome it, as what is in it is long overdue. However, so little will be achieved through it that it is obvious that it will be the new Government to whom we must look to do the rest for a secure energy future, for our industry and for our national security.</p>

I noted, from reading the Committee and Report stage debates in the Commons on the Bill, that there was a degree of Conservative backsliding by a number of her colleagues. The revival of climate-change scepticism is there on the Conservative Benches-in both Chambers, indeed-as well as Euroscepticism. I hope that the noble Baroness's excellent speech demonstrates that the Conservative leadership, at least, is standing up to what a number of American writers now call the politics of irrationality in the Republican Party, to which the Conservative Party is sometimes tempted to bend.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="100323100000117"></a>This is a modest Bill and we are grateful for small mercies, but we do not see it as being up to the scale of the challenge which we face. Our party has also put out its proposals for sustainable growth and a move towards a sustainable economy, in which we shift the balance away from centralisation and privatisation towards a much more decentralised system with an emphasis on small-scale generation, insulation, local schemes and integrated schemes wherever possible, as against the Government's emphasis on centralised coal and centralised nuclear-coal which is, I note, incidentally, more and more imported coal. Indeed, as I work my allotment in Saltaire, the Settle-Carlisle railway line brings imported coal down to Yorkshire power stations from Cumbrian ports. It is not, any longer, local coal; it is part of our energy dependence. The whole question of carbon capture and storage is not so much a matter of increasing our energy security, but making sure that the South African and Polish coal which we import does not add to the pollution above our land.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="100323100000118"></a>I welcome the demonstration project which Yorkshire has now managed to secure from the European Union and notice that the European Union, in awarding that to Hatfield, mentioned that part of the attraction of the demonstration project is, indeed, that it has the potential to be part of a much broader scheme for carbon capture and storage across Yorkshire. I drove with my wife from Lincoln over to Saltaire this summer and I was very struck, as we passed across the south Yorkshire and north Lincolnshire plain, to see, against the skyline, a succession of huge coal power stations and their heating towers. You no longer see anything in the way of wind-power generation. There are the remnants of a large number of windmills, but nimbyism and the absence of long-term planning have inhibited the sort of renewable energy that we should be pursuing across that large chunk of northern England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="100323100000119"></a>We think that the Government should move a great deal further into what we call wind and wave. Indeed, as I walk up and down the Yorkshire Dales, I regularly pass the Grassington weir with its derelict power station, from which Grassington generated all the town's electricity 60 or 70 years ago. I am conscious that we have all this unused potential small-scale water power in Yorkshire, which the Government have made very little effort to encourage. We now have one demonstration project, in Settle, so if we are looking

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="100323100000120"></a>Feed-in tariffs have been very slow to be developed. It is now some 25 years since I was on holiday with my family in Brittany and we stayed on a farm, the water mill of which was already feeding locally-generated power into the French power system. Along with the Conservatives, we strongly support the proposal for an emissions performance standard and, indeed, on Report in the other place, we moved, with cross-party support, an amendment for an emissions performance standard which was to apply to all new electricity generation plant as a clear restriction on the amount of carbon dioxide that any new electricity generation plant can emit. That narrowly failed to pass in the other place. No doubt there will be discussions among the parties in this Chamber as to how far we wish to add that to the Bill. I look forward to those discussions.</p>

<a name="100323-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="100323100000121"></a>My party has larger ambitions on sustainable growth and in moving to a more sustainable economy. We want to see emissions reduced and we want a reduction in energy dependence and thus, incidentally, in our very substantial trade deficit. We look to new employment in new industries and to signals to the market which encourage everyone to invest in the reduction of carbon emissions. I noted with some puzzlement the statement in the analytical annexe to the low carbon paper that an oil price of $150 per barrel would help to reduce the costs of transition. There are a lot of other things that an oil price of $150 per barrel would not help, including the international politics of the Middle East and of Russia. There are lots of other ways of achieving a similar result, including an emissions performance standard, so, from these Benches, we give a lukewarm welcome-a lukewarm front, we might say-for the modest step forward contained in the Bill.</p>

I wish we could have gone down this road a lot sooner; indeed, some experts have been saying for several years, since the original White Paper, that we already know that CCS works and do not need any more demonstration projects so we should just get on with it.</p>

I hope that the Government will be prepared to give it serious consideration, if possible, within the future shaping of this Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="100323118000003"></a>I refer, as I have done before in your Lordships' House, to the challenging prospect of underground coal gasification, UCG for short. Gasification plants

The challenge of underground gasification, though referred to here several times, seems never to have been seriously considered. It is time that it was. We need clean-coal technology, along with renewables and nuclear, and this could be right at the heart of that.</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="100323118000004"></a>I stress the context of this proposal. Obviously we need different energy sources such as renewables and nuclear. That has got to be done, but it is probably not enough. Our own existing coal stocks, though, as has been mentioned, are massive and now largely unexploited. Those who know tell me that there is a lot more coal under my county, County Durham, than was ever dug out; indeed, some estimates put it at 75 per cent or even over 90 per cent. According to the British Geological Survey, there could be enough still down there to supply the energy needs of this country for 300 years.</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="100323118000005"></a>I should declare a belated and second-hand interest: the mineral rights in County Durham used to belong to my predecessors, the Bishops of Durham, but, after the demise of nationalisation, those rights have now reverted to the Church Commissioners, to whom were granted-unwisely, in my view-stewardship of the ancient episcopal assets. We have all this coal and yet, despite that, we are importing nearly 50 million tonnes of coal per annum from, as has been said, Poland, South Africa, Russia-</p>

It does not take genius to see that there is something wrong with this picture. I thought that this Bill could have been the place where that nettle was grasped. What is to be done? Open-cast digging can be successful on a relatively small scale and in a short timeframe, and can sometimes work for the long-term good of some bits of land, but when practised on the massive scale that we have seen recently in parts of the north-east it causes major environmental damage. In any case, it is impossible for the considerable seams of coal that are under the North Sea-you cannot dig there-and even when you have got it out you are still left with the challenge of clean use. The alternative of deep mining, the old-fashioned sort, even with the technology that would now be available, is still a dangerous business and the disposal of waste remains a problem.</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="100323118000008"></a>I suspect-this is not a party point; it covers all bases-that we have seen nothing done now for 20 years because the appalling social cost of the miners' strike in the 1980s has meant that successive Governments have not wanted to go anywhere near the use of our own coal resources; it would scare everyone silly. However, quite apart from the long-term social deprivation still suffered by many of the old mining communities-I know that there have been wonderful regeneration projects, but the deprivation levels remain shocking; I was visiting some of the old mining towns the weekend before last and it is still appalling that people are living in those conditions-to ignore our existing energy resources because of the bad social experiences of a previous generation looks like cutting off our nose to spite our face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="100323118000009"></a>The other wider reason for pursuing better uses of existing resources is the urgent need in other parts of the world, China and India being the obvious examples, to develop the appropriate technologies. If we could develop that technology ourselves and then export it, we would not only profit ourselves but be in a position to help other countries meet their future carbon needs as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="100323118000010"></a>The particular irony of all this is that two of the universities in my region, Newcastle and Durham, have been working on precisely this UCG technology. They should now be given the chance and, equally importantly, the funding to develop pilot projects to show what can be done. If with this Bill we can set up four CCS demonstration projects, why should we not also set up four or more underground gasification projects?</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="100323118000011"></a>This proposal is not new. As long ago as April 2003, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, spoke about possible collaboration with the USA's FutureGen project and advocated gasification projects, but nothing has been done. There have been more recent exchanges as well.</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="100323118000012"></a>The questions pile up, and perhaps they could be addressed in the present Bill: what has happened to all those projects that have been talked and written about and had initial research done on? Why did they need foreign investment-in one case, Russian money? When the Government pour billions of pounds of taxpayers' money into projects that many taxpayers oppose, why should the future use of our energy resources be dependent on individual entrepreneurs backed by foreign investors? Of course, nobody wants to go back to the spiralling costs of the past when the public purse was treated, so to speak, as a bottomless pit in its own right, but at a time when other Governments, like Germany's, have been heavily subsidising their coal industries, why should our Government not take a lead in investing in the future use of our own resources, for the benefit of our own communities?</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="100323118000013"></a>Setting up and installing gasification is, obviously, expensive, but it does not put at risk human lives or the countryside and it does not pollute the atmosphere. When the real costs of not doing it are taken into account-continuing to import foreign coal, the CCS technology on the surface, the communities that were dependent on coal and are still suffering-there is a very strong case for proceeding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="100323118000014"></a>I raised these and similar questions in your Lordships' House in January 2007 and followed them up with a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. In his reply to me of 13 March 2007, he spoke at length in his inimitable style of the present energy policy, and agreed that the DTI's old Cleaner Fossil Fuels programme had carried out an assessment of UCG. This showed, he said, that UCG had advanced to a stage where it was economically comparable with conventional mining. But, he went on, it would need to be deployed in combination with CCS to make any significant contribution to carbon abatement. I am not an expert, but I suspect that those who are would challenge that statement. In any case, the question is how to use our own resources. The UK strategy, said the noble Lord, did not see UCG as a specific technology to pursue

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="100323118000015"></a>Without knowing the details, it is hard to comment on the noble Lord's further statement that the joining fee for the FutureGen project was not thought to be a cost-effective use of public funds, but, when the future use of our own resources is at stake, a strong case can and should be made for it. I and many others around the old mining areas would greatly welcome it if the present Bill could eventually include this kind of project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="100323118000016"></a>As may be obvious, I am neither an industrialist nor an economist. However, I live in the midst of a proud but somewhat battered old mining community, which still believes doggedly that the coal under its land ought to be used, and used wisely, not least to provide fresh employment. My predecessor but one, David Jenkins, known to many noble Lords, famously stood by the mining communities in the 1980s. My predecessor of a century of more ago, BF Westcott, actually settled the miners' strike in the mid-1890s, including, in a remarkable exercise of episcopal power, sending a messenger to the railway station late in the negotiations, telling them to hold the London train because his Lordship had not yet finished his work. Sadly, I no longer have that power, nor indeed the mineral rights themselves, but I stand with and speak on behalf of the region that I love and serve when I express the hope that the Bill might include proposals for the future use of our own resources and of all available technologies, and that the UCG option, already being developed in the universities of the region, should now be given a chance to prove itself in action.</p>

For 26 years I represented mining communities of a similar character to those in Durham. In the first instance, it would be difficult now to recruit men to go down the shafts to do the preparatory work for UCG. It is also the case that one of the casualties of the privatisation of the coal industry was the laboratories of old British coal, which probably had centred in them more expertise and inventive researchers than any other body in the world. When we talk, as we will this evening, of carbon capture and storage, as the man asking the way to Cork was told, "We would not start from here".</p>

I think it is one of a succession of steps that the Labour Government have taken up a learning curve that some of us wished they had moved up a little more quickly.

The UK is not alone in pursuing this technology. There are companies presently generating electricity in the United Kingdom from gas-fired power stations; E.ON and RWE in Germany have quite interesting and important research work going on.

It is an industry that we hope will take off and even the Government's modest, but not unrealistic, ambitions say it will be at the earliest 2020 or 2022 for the first stage and perhaps 2025 for a bolt-on development. If that is the case, it will be seven to 10 years beyond the large plant directive which will make coal burning and some aspects of gas burning very expensive if there is an interim period before this new technology comes in.</p>

On the front page of this morning's <I>Scotsman</I><I></I>spokesmen for the Scottish National Party were saying that they are confident that 500 jobs a month will be created in green technologies in Scotland alone over the next 10 years. God knows how they are going to do that but I leave that to others to work out. There are a number of research laboratories across the United Kingdom and institutions have been mentioned already-the bright ideas bank has many borrowers at the moment. I am not sure how much of it will actually deliver the kind of returns that we would want. I certainly wish the Government well.</p>

Now we are not really having competition of the same order but we are going to have a bet on CCS, there are a number of other countries that might beat us to the punch. However, it is worth being there not necessarily because it will make a dramatic impact on UK generation but rather because it will give us an opportunity to sell our wares elsewhere in the world where they are of greater significance. One obviously thinks first of India and China, both of which have people of talent equal to our own and probably working twice as hard as we are. I do not mean any disrespect to the people we have in the United Kingdom, but it is a fact that they have so many people whom they can put to it.</p>

This Bill formalises the social tariff which will enable a number of poorer people to be given some assistance by clever use of Government data. We will see the alleviation to an extent of fuel poverty for a number of pensioners over 70 who are currently on pension credit. I speak here as the vice-president of National Energy Action and the president of its Scottish equivalent, Energy Action Scotland. They have provided compelling figures which suggest that the Â£80 that is going to be available for pensioners over 70 on pension credit could be made

The groups have been quite clearly indicated in the winter payment arrangements-households where there is disability, severe disability, a disabled child, higher pensioners, households with children under five and households receiving child tax credit.</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="100323118000024"></a>In this context, there are some 4.1 million households: 2.7 million of them are covered by pension credit; 1.4 million are affected by disability and the other groupings previously mentioned. It would currently cost in the order of Â£320 million to pay the individuals. That would account for something like Â£13 a household. Currently we consumers are paying some Â£84 per household for environmental ROCs and other forms of assistance and subsidy. For a relatively modest amount of money we could do a lot for other vulnerable groupings. Some noble Lords may well have received letters from Macmillan Cancer Support containing quite disturbing statistics about the number of people who are not in receipt of benefit and are suffering from cancer and deserve support. I was quite shocked- I did not appreciate the extent of such disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="100323118000025"></a>In the summer consultations which the Government are required to fulfil under the legislation, I would hope that some of these specific cases that I outlined, and in particular the cancer sufferers, will be given some kind of assistance. I am not one of those who will go out of my way to criticise the Government for what they have done about fuel poverty because in a number of respects they have worked very hard to deal with households and with individual circumstances. The problem is that energy prices have oscillated in such a bizarre and unkind way over the past five or six years, in circumstances beyond the control of the British Government. The Government deserve credit but it must be extremely frustrating when we see that so many of these matters are now beyond the control and capability of the national Government. Indeed, it has to be said that the European Union is coming towards some kind of regulatory understanding. I would not use the word "regime". There are efforts being made but, sadly, they are probably not going to be capable of assistance. Therefore more and more will be dependent on the use of the social security system and the inventive use of statistical information now available to the Government following the legislation allowing information on pensions and other social security benefits to be switched from one department to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="100323118000026"></a>I also welcome the extension and the refining of some of Ofgem's roles. I have often felt that Ofgem as a regulator left a bit to be desired. When we discussed the NPS statement there was a certain degree of impatience, uncharacteristic impatience, in the Minister's views about certain views expressed by the Ofgem.</p>

However, I would like to think that after the election we would look afresh at the regulation of energy. After 10 to 12 years we have gone from the adventure playground of the free marketers, the Hobart House brigade over at the Institute of Economic Affairs-people whom I, as a student in the 1960s, thought represented the dark side of the moon. They were given virtually complete control of energy

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="100323118000028"></a>If we are to review the role of Ofgem post the general election, the people opposite have to recognise the sort of things we have to look at. We have to consider security of supply and whether it should be the responsibility of the state to have the appropriate places in which to store the gas we need. We do not have enough at the moment; we do not need as much as the French and the Germans because we have rather a large store in the North Sea. Nevertheless, we need an enhanced amount. An example of market failure has been the inability of energy companies to bend their minds to this issue. They have not dealt with it adequately. As chairman of a Select Committee in another place, I banged on for years about having better storage facilities for LNG and the like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="100323118000029"></a>We will have an opportunity to do something post the election, regardless of who wins-and noble Lords know who I want to win. A Government of any complexion must look at energy security, the role of regulation and the role of the state. There is a case, in light of the market failure over the past 20 years, for which I am not castigating only the present Government-the previous ones were just as culpable. </p>

I would like to think that the Government will be concerned about fuel poverty as well as about the poverty of ambition regarding some of the objectives that we could achieve. If there is one reason above all others for having another Labour Government, it is that nothing I have heard from the Benches opposite suggests that they are as ambitious or as capable of dealing with these matters as my noble friend.</p>

I remember the exchanges we had at Question Time in 2007 to which he referred. I continue to get, through various blogs, all sorts of information about what is going on out there on the underground gasification of coal. Like him, I am astonished that there seems to be so little official interest in this. One of the things I remember from our earlier exchanges is that his miners do not want to go underground again. Underground gasification of coal is the way to exploit those energy resources, without the kind of problems which faced miners going underground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="100323115000035"></a>A Second Reading debate is a temptation to embark on a tour d'horizon of energy policy across the board. After all, we have now had three hard-hitting reports, all of which have claimed, with some justification and much force, that the Government's energy policy is failing. The Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Minister's favourite regulator, Ofgem, have all demanded that there has to be a much more structured and clear policy for energy in this country. The House will be relieved to know that I shall resist the temptation, partly because we were engaged in nearly 12 hours of debate in Grand Committee on the national policy statements, but mainly because it would not be appropriate at this hour. All I will say is that the Bill makes precious little progress towards that kind of reform of energy policy which this country so desperately needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="100323115000036"></a>Unlike most of the other speakers in this debate so far, I am going to talk about the Bill, which contains two issues that need to be examined. The first is carbon capture and storage. Again, we discussed this at some length on 11 March in Grand Committee. The Bill creates the mechanism by which the demonstration projects-I believe that they are still called that-will be financed. However, it is a sad story of dither and delay.</p>

Everything will be set out in regulations, of which we have not yet seen any drafts, and there is no estimate of cost. What we have got in the past few days-indeed, since the last time the Minister addressed us in Grand Committee-is an indication of some of the companies that may be taking part in this competition. From the press release issued by the department on 17 March, we know that Scottish Power, with its project at Longannet, is certainly one of them and that Scottish and Southern at Ferrybridge in Yorkshire may be another. Then there is the E.ON project at Kingsnorth in Kent. Some of these are described as having got to the stage of front-end engineering studies.

<p><a name="100323115000058"></a>Has the <I>Guardian</I> journalist got it right? Is it true that we will not know anything until next year, 2011? Perhaps the Minister will be able to give us an answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="100323115000039"></a>Part 2 of the Bill covers schemes for reducing fuel poverty. I, too, agree with every other speaker that this is a very important part of the Bill. However, I have some questions and have given the Minister notice that I wish to raise them. The House will remember the background; under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, as the Minister mentioned, 11 million households would be helped with loft and cavity wall insulation. Right from the beginning, it troubled me how the companies were to know who they were supposed to help. I remember an exchange across the Floor of the House with the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who was quite unable to tell us. The companies had to go on a fishing expedition, knocking on doors, trying to find out who had not had the work done and who was entitled under programmes such as Warm Front. It was extraordinary.</p>

<a name="100323-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="100323115000040"></a>We started with the Pensions Act 2008 and its regulations, which we debated in Grand Committee last January, where there was a tiny first step of data sharing between the Government and the energy companies relating to people who were entitled to the guaranteed element of pension credit. The noble Lord has no doubt studied it: it is a very small part of the 11 million households that are supposed to be benefiting from those programmes.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="100323115000041"></a>Of course the problem has always been the data protection legislation and the fact that people do not like to think that somebody will knock on their door saying, "You're poor and we're here to help you". That I can totally understand. However, when I raised this in debate on 26 January, I asked why these new regulations were okay so far as data protection was concerned whereas everything that went before was not okay. What was the difference? It is very relevant to Part 2 of this Bill, because here again we are going to have data sharing. Why is that all right under the data protection legislation, while the earlier, more ambitious schemes clearly fell foul?</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="100323115000042"></a>Clause 9(5) spells out:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="100323115000061"></a>"A support scheme may in particular provide for scheme customers to be determined in any of the following ways-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="100323115000062"></a>(a) by reference to membership of, or to family or other relationship to a member of, a fuel poverty risk group;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="100323115000063"></a>(b) by scheme suppliers;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="100323115000064"></a>(c) by, or by reference to evidence provided by, the Secretary of State".</p>

<p><a name="100323115000059"></a>It is that third one where one comes back again to this issue of data sharing.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="100323115000043"></a>I have had a couple of letters from the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton-I will not quote them at this hour of the night-who took those regulations through Grand Committee. He has made the point that, if you are having an automatic benefit such as the rebate provided for under this Bill, then you can perfectly safely exchange the information, or share the data. If you are merely asking people whether they want something-whether they want their house fitted with roof insulation, for example-then you cannot. I totally fail to understand why that makes a difference.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="100323115000044"></a>The Minister also said that the Information Commissioner was broadly satisfied. I am not sure what that means. I asked to see the correspondence; I should have put in a Freedom of Information request,   


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_917"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 917</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but I did not. Why? What change has he made? How can it possibly be right to share data freely with energy supplying companies for the purposes of the rebates under this Bill, when it clearly was not right to share data for the benefit of the CERT scheme under the previous legislation? I hope that the Minister will be able to answer that question.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="100323115000045"></a>Finally, when one turns to Part 3 of the Bill, with the amendments on the duties of Ofgem, my initial reaction was that both major parties are now committed to substantial changes in the role and remit of Ofgem. We may hear something about this in the Budget tomorrow-I do not know. We certainly have the statement in the <I>Times</I><I></I>by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, spelling out very clearly that it needed to be substantially changed. As our policy statement says, the Conservative Party agrees with that. We are arguing for a substantial change there. Therefore, my first reaction was to say, "Do we really want to go fiddling around with these details now, when we are going to have legislation in any event, whoever becomes the Government, which is going to make major changes to the remit of Ofgem?"</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="100323115000046"></a>However, having studied the details of the Bill and talked about it, there are things in Part 3 which do seem sensible. It is right to give Ofgem these new powers, even if they may shortly be overtaken by others. In particular, I would mention the new power to modify the market power licence conditions spelled out in Clauses 18 to 23 and, perhaps even more importantly, the power to adjust charges to help disadvantaged groups of customers. It is quite complicated; explanations can be found on pages 27 to 28 of the Explanatory Memorandum. I certainly will not take up the time of the House reading all that out.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="100323115000047"></a>We are not going to have a Committee stage on this Bill other than in the wash-up. That seems to be inevitable, which is why I said to the Minister earlier today that it was going to be a pretty funny Second Reading. I have some amendments to Part 3 that I would have liked to have moved; whether we shall have a chance, I do not know. On balance, I think that Part 3 should go through to the wash-up and that the Bill should eventually become law, albeit in a very short timescale. It has been properly debated in the other place-there is no question about that. They had a good go at it, and if we do not have a go at it, I think there will be opportunities in future energy legislation very soon after the election. I have asked two straightforward questions. First, is it right that we are not going to see a winner to the CCS competitions until next year? Secondly, why is it that the data protection is okay for some purposes and not for others? I simply do not understand it.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="100323115000049"></a>Turning to carbon capture and storage, I must rather fully declare an interest. I am honorary president of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, a position which I took up when the association was formed several years ago. It is a totally subscription-based organisation and not one-as alleged in today's <I>Times</I>-that could bring in billions in money. The reason I became involved in this association was that carbon capture and storage seemed to me to be a vital bridging technology for as long as we continue to burn fossil fuels, during a transition to a low-carbon energy economy. That remains my view. It is something that we have to have.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="100323115000050"></a>I take it that when one is talking about government policy on carbon capture and storage, one can now discuss the document which the Secretary of State launched last week, <I>Clean </I><I>C</I><I>oal, </I><I>A</I><I>n </I><I>I</I><I>ndustrial </I><I>S</I><I>trategy for the </I><I>D</I><I>evelopment of </I><I>C</I><I>arbon </I><I>C</I><I>apture and </I><I>S</I><I>torage across the UK.</I> I am afraid that I find this a particularly disappointing document. It is not that good things have not been done, but that there is a real lack, as far as I can see, of both a sense of urgency and a sense of commitment. Speaking of urgency, I refer to paragraph 1.9 in this document, which states that as part of the Government's plans for a long-term transition to clean coal:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="100323115000065"></a>"A rolling review process, which is planned to report by 2018, will consider the appropriate regulatory and financial framework to further drive the move to clean coal".</p>

<p><a name="100323115000051"></a>It says 2018, my Lords.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="100323115000052"></a>There is no reference in the document to how one will put in place the infrastructure for carbon capture and storage. It is universally recognised within the industry that this is likely to be the bottleneck. The demonstrators are largely-not exclusively, but largely-concerned with the demonstration of capture technology. The whole infrastructure for transferring CO2 from where it is generated, in power stations round the country, really has to be subject to planning now, simply because it will involve pipelines which will involve permitting. We know that even with the best will in the world, that is a very long process. Unless we start it now, we have no chance of implementing carbon capture and storage in a timely way. I need not remind the Department of Energy and Climate Change of the urgency of getting emissions under control.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="100323115000053"></a>What about commitment? Page 16 of the document states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="100323115000066"></a>"It is generally agreed that, if proven, CCS will be needed to make a substantial contribution ... to global abatement of CO2".</p>

<p><a name="100323115000060"></a>If proven? I should be grateful if the Minister could produce one chemical engineer who thinks that there is any technical difficulty in achieving carbon capture and storage.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="100323115000054"></a>There is uncertainty over the cost. However, the same document includes a very sensible and realistic table of the costs of carbon capture and storage. It represents the upper costs perfectly reasonably, and they will probably be less. In a number of places we find carbon capture recommended if it is "affordable". What is affordable? If it is not affordable, what is plan B? Does the Minister intend that we repeal the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_919"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 919</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Climate Change Act or that the country should stop burning gas and coal for the next 30 to 40 years? That is a pretty tough choice either way. At the moment, this is unresolved in the document which the Government have produced. It is the demonstrable lack of commitment that dogs UK industry. The Government cannot expect UK industry to take carbon capture and storage seriously and commit to it before the Government do the same.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="100323115000055"></a>I turn briefly to other matters. Whichever hue of Government we have after the election, a serious review of energy will be urgent. The main reason is that, globally, the fossil fuel situation in the past 18 months has changed profoundly, due to a recognition that shale gas is a viable economic proposition. I confess that for quite a long time I was sceptical about shale gas, but now I think that it has been sufficiently demonstrated in the United States that there can be little doubt. It is relatively poorly understood or explored but clearly it will be important. The US is now cancelling orders for imported liquefied natural gas from the Middle East. We see that Canada is now preparing to export liquefied natural gas to China. The natural gas price has become decoupled from the oil price to which it has been tied for so long. Indeed, we see relatively lower gas prices, much more security of gas supply and the UK in a relatively good position. We were on the end of the pipelines coming from eastern Europe, but this country is pretty well served with LNG terminals. A lot of European LNG will come in and it will be exported by our pipelines to Europe. This time, we are on the right end of the pipeline. Clearly, that has profound implications for energy policy.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="100323115000056"></a>Another point is that the Government should be aware that there is widespread concern in the energy generating community that the Government have not fully grasped the operational and business implications of wind energy targets, which, if implemented, will take wind generation to more than half of the maximum winter demand. It is not that that cannot be done, but it is not necessarily a very sensible way of proceeding. I declare an interest as the chairman of a wind energy company. However, I think that this is probably excessive. An incoming Government must pay much more attention to diversifying the renewables portfolio, as a number of noble Lords have pointed out. Biogas and biomass are becoming more important. Marine tidal stream has just completed a successful demonstration in Northern Ireland. The important thing about these renewables is that they are out of phase with wind. You can get away with a much larger fraction of renewables in your energy portfolio if you have a spread across the field.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="100323115000057"></a>The Bill is fine as far as it goes, and I hope that it passes smoothly. I am sorry that we are unlikely to have the opportunity to debate it in much more depth. It disappoints me on its commitment, to CCS. A new Government will have to tackle that if they wish to move ahead at the industrial level. Undoubtedly, we will need a new energy policy.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="100323120000002"></a>The Government seem to have two reasons for their almost experiments with carbon capture and storage. The first is the declared desire for coal to contribute significantly to the mix of the energy security of this country. The second is the recognition that coal-fired generation will be absolutely vast in India, China and other countries for years to come. New technologies have export potential. The IEA in its <I>World Energy Outlook 2008</I> quoted figures of coal production rising from less than 4,500 million tonnes of coal equivalent to something over 7,000 million tonnes of coal equivalent by 2030. I can well see that the Government may have in mind that that is a very attractive market, even if they do not have their heart and soul in what will happen with coal-fired generation in this country. I shall turn to that in a moment.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="100323120000003"></a>In the Yorkshire region, there is a cluster of carbon dioxide emitters. They do not comprise just coal, although mention has been made of the three big coal-fired generators, Ferrybridge, Eggborough and Drax. Incidentally, I think that they are cooling towers rather than heating towers; they might blow up if they were heating towers. In total, the emitters in Yorkshire emit around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. That is equivalent to about half the carbon dioxide emissions generated by all UK households, so a very large amount of carbon dioxide emissions are generated in the Yorkshire and Humber region. However, only half of that comes from coal-fired power stations. Fifteen million tonnes come from gas-fired stations; 2.5 million tonnes come from oil-fired stations; between 5 million and 7 million tonnes come from the Corus steelworks at Scunthorpe, depending on its operating capacity; more than 1 million tonnes come from a glassworks; and 1 million tonnes come from a cement works. I say all this because, if carbon capture and storage is to mean something in the long run, it must deal with more than just coal. It is not just a question of coal in the United Kingdom. In the Yorkshire and Humber region, a large amount of carbon dioxide is being pumped into the system from around 12 major sources. Off the coast of Humber, in the southern part of the North Sea gas fields, there is a whole range of potential storage sites.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="100323120000004"></a>The Yorkshire region demonstrates exactly that if you put together a carbon capture pipeline transport and storage system, it makes sense to do it in a place that will have a strategic long-term likelihood of success. One thing that bothers me somewhat about the current situation is that this experiment with four carbon capture schemes does not seem to fit into a strategy. Trials may take place in different parts of the country but, in a large region with a substantial number of emitters, the construction of a pipeline system and a storage network that serves all of them would make a great deal of sense. Although the Bill can encompass gas-fired power stations, that is not the Government's intention, as the Minister said. It would be helpful if the Minister could reassure me on my next point. I wonder whether emissions from cement, gas and other  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_921"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 921</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>things come under BIS or DECC. Are DECC and BIS talking about a strategy that makes sense across the board? My instinct is that DECC is concerned with climate change and has certain ideas about energy generation, but that other types of emissions may fall under other parts of government.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="100323120000005"></a>Looking at the trial scheme in the long term, if you develop a pipeline system that goes out to sea and into a storage system, it will be extremely expensive for a single source of carbon emission-a coal-fired power station-to meet the whole cost of a pipeline going out to the coast and into that storage system. The capacity of such a system would be very small. If, on the other hand, you intended to have a series of these linked together over a period, you would put in a completely different size of pipeline. The diameter of a pipeline to serve a single emitter would be about 12 inches. If you put in a pipeline that, over time, could link in with a series of emitters, it would be 48 inches. Is this issue being considered? If you are to put in a pipeline that can serve all the coal-fired power stations in the Yorkshire and Humber region, it is no good putting in a 12-inch pipeline because, over time, you will have to put in another 12-inch pipeline, which would clearly be silly. Has the Minister given any thought to this?</p>

People have argued that there needs to be a CO2 grid and that one of the tasks of government is to ensure that as carbon capture and storage is developed-not only for coal but for other emitters, as he said-there is a proper CO2 grid to collect it and pipe it to the place where it is to be stored. Would he support that?</p>

I would not suggest one grid for the whole of the United Kingdom, but certainly in the Yorkshire region, with its 12 major sources of emissions-as I have explained-it would be logical and extremely sensible to have a grid. What is the intention of the Government in this regard? If they really believe in this and intend it to be a strategic investment for the UK-not an export market for technology to India and China-I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that that is the way to go forward and I would be extremely interested in it. The Government should develop a grid for the Yorkshire and Humber region. That would make an awful lot of sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="100323120000008"></a>My next two points concern strategy. A large amount of British coal-fired electricity generation will cease to operate well before 2020, given the large combustion plant directive. Other EU legislation will mean that other plants will be out of commission by the mid-2020s. Some commentators think that there will be no coal-fired power generation left in the UK by the mid-2020s. If these commercial trials are to lead to coal-fired generation in the UK thereafter, there may be none left on the timescale to which we are working. The coal-fired power stations that face potential closure will be considering the best use of their site. If they feel that there is uncertainty about carbon capture and storage and the Government's commitment, they will build a gas-fired power station on the site of the coal-fired  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_922"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 922</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power station. Given the current regulation and policy, They cannot afford to let a coal-fired station close and then wait another 10 years to see whether the Government have carbon capture and storage in place. That is not what will happen at all. The Minister is very much on top of his brief, but does he agree that there is a real possibility that we may be applying commercial trials to a coal-fired generation scheme that may not exist by the 2020s? Has he considered that?</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="100323120000009"></a>As regards the financial and other elements of investment decisions, how can the coal-fired generation industry be confident that the long-term financial and regulatory frameworks will be in place that will be necessary to ensure take-up of carbon capture and storage, even if these demonstration projects prove technically feasible? I have seen one estimate based on the assumption of an emissions trading carbon price in Europe of â¬35. Even that would not be enough to make carbon capture and storage commercially viable. The current price is â¬12 to â¬13. If this is based on the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme price, with some modest subsidy, how does that square up to the viability of this operation? On the other hand, are the Government considering whether to oblige electricity suppliers to buy a certain capacity from carbon capture and storage generators? In other words, just as there is a renewables obligation, is it the Government's thinking that there will be a carbon capture and storage generation obligation? That would mean that, whatever the price of carbon, there would be an absolute obligation to buy some.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="100323120000010"></a>These are important matters. When I talk to coal-fired generators, I am told that the carbon issue that they are thinking about is timing. They think that things are going far too slowly and that these trials will not have borne enough results to convince the Government of the day to influence investment decisions on what they will do when they close the plant down. They are so unclear about the Government's intentions in- relation to the price of carbon and commitments and obligations to buy the output from these plants-that there is serious doubt about whether these commercial trials will lead to investment by the time we get to the 2020s and 2030s. I look forward with great interest to what the Minister has to say on these matters.</p>

The mechanism is to be a levy on electricity suppliers, which they, in turn, are expected to recover from electricity users. The amount to be raised, we are told by Ministers, will be Â£9.5 billion over 10 years. At the same time, to offset the effect of the levy for those in fuel poverty, the industry will be obliged to make available at least Â£300 million per annum by 2013-14 to support the most vulnerable consumers-twice the maximum amount that companies will have spent per annum hitherto under a voluntary agreement negotiated with the Government, which will now be superseded. Electricity bills for the remainder of consumers will then, of course, rise further. The levy raised will be spent by the administrator, Ofgem, on promoting four trials, which

Then we will know, we hope, whether the technology passes the test of being technically and economically viable on the scale required for mass deployment. By "economically viable" is presumably meant whether the Government decide that they, or the electricity consumer, can afford whatever additional subsidies will be judged necessary to incentivise the rollout of the technology.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="100323120000012"></a>Then there is the whole paraphernalia of the transport and storage of liquefied CO2 through a vast network of pipelines to some cavernous spaces under the North Sea, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, described. That is not cheap and is achievable only with further subsidy, no doubt, or by making any alternative even more expensive by means of a carbon tax, for example. I do not see us being carried very far along the road of installed CCS by means of the Â£9.5 billion alone.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="100323120000013"></a>The moment may come when we have to decide to accept that there is a limit to what we can do to reduce further our carbon emissions and, for the sake of our energy security, accept some coal together with its emissions. This might be plan B for the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. After all, it is what we do today in the case of gas, whose emissions are far from zero and whose deployment is proceeding apace.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="100323120000014"></a>What happens if the CCS trials do not produce a satisfactory result? Do we really expect that India and China will abandon their use of the abundant cheap coal to which they have access just because we have discovered that clean coal is too expensive? Do we expect that they will have held back while we conducted the trials? The CCS levy is only the latest, and will not be the last, in a series of costs that the Government are imposing on the British electricity consumer in the cause of persuading the rest of the world to reduce carbon emissions because of their supposed effect on global temperatures.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="100323120000015"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, listed in Grand Committee on 11 March 2010, before CCS we had the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, the renewables obligation and the carbon emissions reduction scheme, while still to come are feed-in tariffs, the renewable heat incentive and smart meters, not to mention electric cars, although in that case it may be the taxpayer who is going to be called on in the first instance. How much the consumer will be willing to take is a moot point, especially as he is now learning that for the past 20 years climate science has been corrupted by politics to deliver the warnings that justify all this expense.</p>

<a name="100323-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="100323120000016"></a>I was pleased, therefore, when my honourable friend the shadow Energy Minister declared, during the passage of this Bill in another place, that he wanted energy bills received by customers to list the amounts attributable to environmental legislation. I am even more pleased that this has now been carried over into my party's latest energy consultation paper, which was published last week, as was discussed. Towards the end of that document is this passage:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="100323120000058"></a>"The first step ... is to be absolutely transparent about the costs to consumers of existing and future subsidies, so that the public has a clear view of the extra burdens mandated by policymakers. Under a Conservative Government all consumer-paid subsidies will be disclosed on energy bills so that bill payers can be informed about the level of contribution they are making".</p>

<p><a name="100323120000017"></a>The present Government have made no move in that direction. Transparency is the last thing that they have shown any interest in in this field.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="100323120000018"></a>The Conservative energy paper goes on to say that the next step is to clarify that no energy subsidy should be permanent and that it should cease when a technology is mature. There is not much danger of that happening to CCS within the lifetime of most of us-the baby is still in the cradle. However, it raises the interesting question of what should happen to wind. Wind is now promised enormous subsidies by the present Government. It is estimated that three quarters of the Â£200 billion required investment in our energy infrastructure is necessitated by the Government's determination to build 10,000 wind turbines. Is wind power not a mature technology yet? Will it still not be so in 2037? Or does its need for subsidy have nothing to do with its immaturity and everything to do with the fact that its uncontrollability as a power source makes it completely unsuitable for electricity generation in an advanced economy, as has been the case from day one?</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="100323120000019"></a>All parties seem tempted by the notion that CCS, with these trials for which the Government are organising these subsidies, offers this country a glittering industrial opportunity. Leaving aside the whole question of whether it is desirable for Governments to attempt to pick winners-or losers, more likely, in the field of renewable energy-there is a danger involved in setting out to build an industry in a sector that would not exist without subsidies. Governments eventually abandon policies that turn out to be uneconomic. They even run out of money-if not here, in other countries. Export markets can disappear for that reason. Moreover, the subsidies are a cost that subtracts from purchasing power in an economy and therefore lowers economic activity generally. The jobs gained for wind turbine blade construction in the north-east, say, can be more than offset by jobs lost throughout the economy as a whole as a result of the steep rise in electricity prices produced by the subsidies.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="100323120000020"></a>It is likely that the subsidies will create far more jobs overseas than they create here. That may be a reason why China plays along with wind power and other renewable energy technologies. It sees ahead very profitable export prospects. In Germany, feed-in tariffs have produced an exploding demand for photovoltaic installations-a most unsuitable development, one would have thought, in that country of gloomy skies. It has now been found that, although Germany is a manufacturing and exporting powerhouse, half of the demand in recent years has been met by imports from China and Japan. Here I fear that we are all set to let the same thing happen under present policies.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="100323120000021"></a>In conclusion, I shall be interested to hear what the fate of this Bill will be with so little of the Parliament left. I imagine that its fate is largely in the hands of the opposition parties. Perhaps the wind-up speakers can enlighten the rest of us about what parts of the Bill they feel inclined to wave through, as I believe they are entitled to under our strange constitutional procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="100323120000023"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham made some very pungent points about coal-all of which I completely concur with. At home, before going green, we used to burn coal which came all the way from China. That was an extraordinary situation to be in, although I now have an air source pump which was also made in China. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, on fuel security, which is why in previous energy Bills I have promoted the use of biofuels. Again, I echo the comments of my noble friend Lord Oxburgh about the future of fossil fuels, albeit that I am married to a Texan fossil-fuel explorator.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="100323120000024"></a>It is hard to credit that, yet again, we are tackling another Energy Bill, and I cannot help but think what a waste of time-and, indeed, energy-this debate is. However, I wish to limit my comments to Part 2 of the Bill regarding fuel poverty-a subject that I have often raised in your Lordships' House since 1999. I shall always treasure the memory of my dear friend, the late Lord Ewing of Kirkford, pleading with the then Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, that because I live in a freezing, 109-room "but and ben" in the Scottish Borders, I ought to be eligible for a cold weather payment. Not unnaturally-albeit that I open my home to the visiting public-the Minister did not think that I would qualify.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="100323120000025"></a>Although I am 11 years older and married to a senior citizen, I do not wish to try to persuade the House that I am a deserving case. But I wish to plead the case for those severely disadvantaged people who have to toss a coin to discover whether it is food or fuel that gets their limited budget. My main concern is the geographic differences-a point that I have often raised when fuel poverty has been discussed in your Lordships' House. I accept that it is a very complex issue and that it is expensive to administrate, which is one of the reasons why I have finally, albeit reluctantly, dropped my campaign for payments to be means tested.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="100323120000026"></a>I would dearly like to invite the Minister to come to visit me in Scotland on the hottest day of the year. We would take a leisurely stroll around our farm and he would notice smoke coming out of every one of our 54 cottage chimneys. Indeed, I would yet again extend an invitation to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, if it was not for fear of being refused once again.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="100323120000027"></a>If I was to accept a similar invitation from the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, to tour the Midlands I would, I am sure, not detect a single whiff of smoke from a residential chimney, and it is a sorry situation that the welfare benefits system in the United Kingdom takes no account whatever of the much higher costs associated with the geographical location of the claimant-even where there may be a considerable disadvantage. For example, it is obvious that the colder the climate, the greater the need for expenditure in order to keep the home warm. Equally, it is clear that where a household lacks access to the most economic source of domestic heating-normally mains gas-and is dependent on more expensive fuels such as LPG, any disadvantage is greatly worsened.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_926"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 926</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="100323120000028"></a>This combination of circumstances is particularly prevalent in rural Scotland and demonstrates a failing of social security policy. There is virtually no recognition that different circumstances call for different levels of support. This is particularly true of energy costs, whereby the local climate can have a major bearing on the required expenditure. The colder the climate, the greater the need for additional heating; and this has clear consequences for household budgets.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="100323120000029"></a>If, for example, one takes Bristol as the mean, in Braemar-which is a little further north from me and had a very harsh spell of weather this year-last year the average householder spent 65.2 per cent more on heating costs than a Bristol resident. That is a huge increase. Eligibility for cold weather payments is restricted to the poorest and most disadvantaged households, and rightly so. To qualify for a payment, the household must be on the lowest level of welfare benefit and must be vulnerable as a result of age-they must be over 60 or with a child under five-or disability. A cold weather payment is made only when the average daily temperature over a period of seven consecutive days has been, or is forecast to be, 0 degrees centigrade or less.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="100323120000030"></a>The Government have been resistant to the argument that wind chill should be factored in the cold weather payments system. The Government's response can be summarised as: a number of formulae are used to calculate the combined effects of air temperature and wind speed on the human body when in the open air-commonly referred to as wind chill. However, the Building Research Establishment advises us that these formulae are not appropriate when assessing heat loss from buildings, because different heat mechanisms apply. I believe that factoring in wind chill would be of significant benefit to some of the most vulnerable households in the United Kingdom and would cost only Â£300 million. In relation to running government quangos, which cost Â£32 billion per annum-I repeat, Â£32 billion per annum-that measure would surely be just kindling. I hope that the Minister will take this on board. In this day and age, and in this society in which we live, surely it is an absolute scandal that any resident of the United Kingdom is subject to any degree of fuel poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="100323120000032"></a>I remind the House that the 2050 target for carbon dioxide emissions for this country is 20 per cent of the 1990 emissions figure. This country passed that limit in about 1850, when the population was about 22.5 million. To achieve that target, therefore, we need nothing short of a revolution in our energy systems. I sympathise with the Minister and indeed understand his anxiety that carbon capture and storage should work. The issue is not whether it will work. We have heard the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and we can be absolutely confident that it will work. The question that we cannot answer, and one of the reasons why we need a heavy subsidy to produce experimental plant, is we do not know what the economic cost of this system will  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_927"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 927</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be. It is not a question of whether the technology will work that will judge what part it plays in our future energy supplies, it is what its economic competitive position will be. It is not even a question of national energy security, partly because today a lot of the coal consumed in power generation is imported. Disregarding that issue, for me the security of supply position was compromised a little over 100 years ago when the British Navy, which of course was fired by coal, switched to oil, which had to come from the Middle East, because it was more efficient and effective, increased the range of our ships and so on. There are measures and assessments which have to be made, and it remains to be seen whether this huge subsidy which will go into carbon capture and storage actually produces a system which will survive economically after we have installed it. I shall be very interested to see this, because there are many other sources of energy coming forward which may well be a better buy, if you like, for the great British consumer.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="100323120000033"></a>I have every sympathy with what my noble friend Lord Reay said on the question of what will work. We do not know the answers. I understand the Government's dilemma in this matter; I merely remind the Minister that if he can remember as far back as last Friday morning there were huge headlines in the national papers about a horse that was bound to win a race in the afternoon, and it did not. I wish he had a little less absolute confidence that carbon capture and storage will work, because if it is uneconomic here it is also likely to be uneconomic, or uncompetitive economically, in other countries as well. Even India and China with their huge populations, energy demand and difficulties in modernising their societies will have to face the hard reality that if CCS is not economically competitive it will not provide a solution-and they will be the first to change their systems.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="100323120000034"></a>I come back to the Bill. I have a little difficulty with it because this evening we are having to have in effect not just a Second Reading debate but also a Committee stage and a Report stage. Its next stage is going to be this awful thing called a wash-up when what can be agreed is agreed and what cannot be agreed is passed over; it remains to be seen what will happen at that stage. I would welcome some assurances if the Minister is in a position to give them.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="100323120000035"></a>I accept the need to subsidise these experimental installations, but I regret it. It seems that one of the reasons we need this subsidy is the complete failure so far of the European Emissions Trading Scheme to have any real effect on energy markets. If that was working properly, perhaps we would not need this degree of subsidy, at least. I wonder if the Minister will give an assurance that after these installations have been made and the levy has been put in place, the levy and indeed the charge on consumers will only last as long as they are required to pay for those installations.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="100323120000036"></a>I have an awful memory of what happened to the Dartford Tunnel tolls. When the latest Dartford Tunnel installation was established-under an Act of Parliament -it was agreed that the tolls would pay all the running and construction costs, a reasonable profit to the developer who undertook the latest bridge installation and so on, and then they would cease. Shortly after  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_928"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 928</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this Government came to power in 1997, one of their first actions was to have a little slip in one of the Transport Bills to enable the tolls to continue ad infinitum because they rather enjoyed the revenue stream. That is life, and I worry that it might happen in the case of this other subsidy.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="100323120000037"></a>The second point is that all the powers under this part of the Bill are dealt with by the Minister under regulation. We always have difficulty with regulations. Many of us have spent happy hours on them, and no doubt the Minister has also spent happy hours answering requests for information about how these regulations are to be made and what will happen. One of the requirements in the Bill is that the Minister will consult the regulator, Ofgem, and such other persons as he may choose. I make a plea, which I hope he will answer, that the consultation will be very widespread: it should go across the broad industrial and commercial sector because there are very particular views. He will also have power under the regulations described in the Bill to choose particular sectors that might be affected by or exempt from the levy. Under those which might be exempt, perhaps emissions-free energy should not have to pay the levy: that seems wholly sensible and would also give a little added incentive for people to produce emissions-free energy if that were possible.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="100323120000038"></a>I admit that I had a particular plea from a section of the electronics industry: computer centres-perhaps they might be considered for special treatment. I have no interest in this but I was happy to listen to their plea. They made the point that they supply services which are fundamental to the City and so many other aspects of our modern life. It really does not matter to them whether they are in this country or Timbuktu. Nowadays, computer communication is so simple, fast and universal that these services can be provided from anywhere. The particular concern of these companies is to maintain their competitive position in this country so that they can stay here. Those are considerations that it would be entirely proper for the Minister to take into account. I do not say that he necessarily has to accept the argument or the position, but he should look at those aspects in relation to the powers that appear to be given to him by the Bill. I plead with him to give some assurance that his consultation process on that part of the Bill will be sufficiently wide to take account of that sort of thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="100323120000039"></a>I hope that the Bill will largely survive. Enough political points have been made already, so I will only make one. My comment on the political situation is this: the Government have done enough to lose the election, but it remains to be seen whether the Conservatives, in the judgment of the electorate, have done enough to win it.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="100323120000041"></a>I firmly welcome the Bill. I will not be alone in saying that it is good to see my noble friend at the helm on these matters. Why do I welcome it? I will summarise what seems to be glaringly obvious. The Bill will provide better protection for consumers. It will ensure environmental benefits. It will assist in achieving sustainable economic development. It strengthens the provisions for meeting the social challenges of fuel poverty. It faces up to the challenge of the opportunity given to generators for exploitation and making excessive profits at the expense of the consumer-an opportunity resulting from insufficient transmission arrangements. As my noble friend rightly emphasised in his introduction, it recognises that long-term solutions will not be found by constraints alone: increased transmission capacity will be essential.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="100323120000042"></a>I declare an interest-this is not the first time that I have had to do this-as a vice-president for the Campaign for National Parks, president of the Friends of the Lake District and also, happily, a resident of the Lake District National Park. I am deeply impressed by the way in which Ofgem has welcomed its role of social responsibility in protecting both the environment and the interests and well-being of consumers, not least the vulnerable. Evidently, it takes pride in making this a core aspect of its work-one has only to look at the observations that it recently sent us on the Bill. This leads me to ask my noble friend how the Bill will provide for the protection of consumers during the upgrading of the transmission system. What will be Ofgem's responsibility to protect consumers from the adverse impacts that upgrading the infrastructure and lines will inevitably have? This must be seen in the context of the inevitable upheaval involved in the construction of the huge necessary infrastructure, and the power stations themselves, involved in our renewed commitment to nuclear energy.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="100323120000043"></a>Does my noble friend not agree that the Bill could be further strengthened by the addition of clauses spelling out that the costs to consumers and society must be viewed in more than just market-orientated financial terms, and that the precious and priceless character and value of our countryside and scenic inheritance should also be central to Ofgem's duties? In the absence of such clauses, what convincing reassurances can my noble friend give in this respect? As I have argued recently in the Moses Room, my anxiety about the society in which we live is-in the words of the old adage-that we know more and more about the price of everything, and less and less about the value of the things that really matter. For a decent society, we need energy, although I temper that by saying that it is high time we started to think more about how we reduce our dependency on energy generation. We live in very stressful, pressured times; life becomes faster and faster and more and more hectic. For our health and well-being as a society, we desperately need contrast, space and beautiful things  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_930"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 930</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to make our society worth living in. To have a beautiful society we need energy, but we also need the countryside that will provide opportunities for spiritual uplift.</p>

<a name="100323-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="100323120000044"></a>It would be a major tragedy-I do not apologise for repeating the arguments I used recently in the Moses Room-if in this new commitment to the next generation of energy, we were to commit the mistakes made in the first Industrial Revolution. It is not that we did not need the first Industrial Revolution, but with more thought and care, it could have been done without raping and destroying our countryside, including some of the most beautiful valleys in the nation. If we do that again, we shall never be forgiven. People will say, "How foolish they were; with the evidence of the last Industrial Revolution in front of them and with their preoccupation with how the worst scars should be removed, they did it all again".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="100323120000045"></a>From that standpoint, it seems to me that the challenge for all of us, not least for my noble friend, who is always very good when I challenge him-he is a very civilised man and I always think he sympathises with the points I am making-is not to drift into a mindset of either energy or a commitment to our rich inheritance of scenic beauty and so on. The challenge is how we fulfil our obligations to both and how we get our act together. I know that some will say-my noble friend has said to me before in debate-"Hang on a moment, I accept a lot of the strength of that argument, but we also have to consider the economic advantages that come from a new lease of life for energy production and energy provision, which will be advantageous to a lot of people". However, these issues are not simply the preserve of the precious, privileged middle-class or of those who enjoy large estates; they can be much more direct. On the west coast of Cumbria where I live, the paradox is that, against the setting of the unrivalled beauty of the national park, we have some very deprived communities. We have some traditional working-class villages which have nothing to be said for them in aesthetic terms. I have heard people say, "At least we used to have the Solway Firth, the hills of Dumfries beyond and the peninsula out to the far west of Scotland but now we have windmills whirring around, screening the beauty of the view". As the Bill proceeds, we should all face this very big challenge, which I hope we take seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="100323120000047"></a>On the issue of wind, I was a member of the European Union Sub-Committee B on renewable energy, which recommended that wind power would be the answer to the 2020 target. When the committee made a recommendation some 18 months ago, we assumed  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_931"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 931</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that there would be a very positive and swift reaction by the Government to supply the wind answer. We know that there are some five wind farms in which they are engaged at the moment, to a greater or lesser extent, but that will not nearly satisfy the 2020 target for two very good reasons. They have not done anything about setting up a supply chain for the things that they need to stick in the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="100323120000048"></a>At the moment it still takes about nine weeks to put up a single turbine and costs about Â£2 million to do so. We suggested that they needed 3,200 to cover the distance from Lowestoft to just north of Aberdeen, and they are building five farms at the moment. Now we see, as we heard in Grand Committee, that the Prime Minister wants to spend Â£75 billion on wind. If he wanted to do that, he would have to think in terms of extending the line from Lowestoft all the way round the south coast, up the north coast of Cornwall and Devon, way up beyond Blackpool to the Scottish border, because he would not be able to use the deep water or the cliffs which are shielded from wind, and he would have to leave the harbours and the rivers free and open to allow for the normal passage of shipping, so he would have a very poor return for his money. But he could do an awful lot with a very small fraction of the Â£75 billion that he has talked of. I do not even know that he has got Â£75 billion at the moment. I would be extremely surprised to hear that he had. When we produced that report we thought that Â£19 billion would buy 3,400 turbines on the east coast if they were put up at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="100323120000049"></a>It would have been more sensible had the Government at that time looked at their supply chain and realised that they did not have one. For putting up one pylon, you need at least one jack-up boat, which has to have a crane height of 75 metres, a lifting capacity of 72 tonnes, and a hammer capacity of 47,000 pounds a square inch. Just think about that for a moment. That then has to hammer each foundation into the seabed with a tolerance of half a centimetre for the accuracy with which the thing is lined up to be put in the fixing ring which has been put down there first, while it is held by two very brave marine divers. The Royal Marine divers are the best in the world. I remember saying to one of them once, "Aren't you frightened down there when you have to hold these things straight while the hammer hits at 47,000 pounds?". "No, governor, of course not, it is no worse than the effect we have on any girl we stand next to, is it?". Very modest and charming people, the Marines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="100323120000050"></a>As it stands, we have not got one jack-up boat available to or operating for the Government. When we made the report there was one available which they could have had, but they missed their opportunity. Every jack-up boat in Europe is now booked out solidly for nearly four years ahead, at a cost of $160,000 dollars a day. We do not have one. Instead of spending Â£75 billion on a pipedream, why did the Government not take Â£1 million, go to Korea and buy four jack-up boats for about $240,000 each, and we would have had four that would at least have given us a chance of doing it? And what about the gearboxes? You cannot buy them. The only gearbox available in Europe comes

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="100323120000051"></a>One would have expected that the Department of Trade and Industry, or whatever we call it these days, would have done something about going out into the world and finding somebody who could get a licence to manufacture them and bring some industry to Britain. It would have been a very good macroeconomic thing to do. China and India both have excellent gearboxes for which we could probably have got a licence, but no one has moved to get a licence which could be installed in one of the British companies that could do it. So we have lost out on that too and have no supply chain. Forget wind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="100323120000052"></a>What else is there that we can do? Fortunately, there is a salvation, and your Lordships have tiptoed round it all evening without actually getting to it. The answer is certainly carbon capture and storage, but not on a post-combustion basis. It is on a pre-combustion basis; and that is the promised land. It is three times more effective at carbon capture than post-combustion, and it has another huge benefit, in that you can link it to a cleaning process to clean petrol at the same time, and you can drive all the carbon out of oil, by the same process, by simply flowing the extracted carbon from the coal straight through the oil. You get an enormous amount of carbon capture very cheaply.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="100323120000053"></a>The Government would be at a huge advantage if they thought constructively about this. I once put this suggestion to the Minister, who said the Treasury would never wear it. If that is the case, the Treasury is even dafter than we thought, because it could give a tax credit for each tonne of coal that is washed. This would be almost exactly equal to the cost of cleaning a tonne of coal. It would have a zero sum budget to produce a vast amount of clean coal from the whole process, and an enormous amount of clean oil to go with it, that would put back into production an immense amount of the high-carbon-content oil that is left in the North Sea and which people now think is not effective. We have the way to big solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="100323120000054"></a>One American operation has set this up in an absolutely brilliant form at Great Plains in North Dakota. The whole thing happens in one continuous sequence. Pre-combustion, the coal is cleaned and the oil is cleaned at the same time. The whole thing comes down to an immensely profitable and cost-effective operation. We are talking about competition at the moment, but the Bill says grudgingly that the competition will be applied to both pre-combustion and post-combustion. Forget post-combustion; just get on with pre-combustion cleaning and you will get to the promised land. It really is the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="100323120000055"></a>I saw something recently that came very close to one of those moments in one's life, which do not occur too often, when you think, "God, I've just seen the holy grail". This happened in Dublin. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, mentioned it in passing without actually naming it when he talked about tidal streaming in Ireland. It is very nearly ready to go, and it is fantastic. Ireland's concept is that it has a constant shifting tidal base around the whole island. It is the nearest land mass to us anyway. It can harness the energy with a

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="100323120000056"></a>There are other available options, too. No one has said anything tonight about geothermal energy, yet it was said at the European Community's Renewable Energy Policy Conference at Budapest, which I had the honour to attend on behalf of your Lordships' House last year, that the wonders of geothermal energy are simply there for the world to take if we can get them. You can get geothermal energy anywhere where you can get through the surface of the earth. The easiest place to do this is currently Norway, but there would be a big degradation of it in transmission to us from Norway. On the other hand, Norway could convert it into hydrogen. If we converted some tankers into hydrogen carriers, could we not develop a station that was driven by hydrogen on a very cheap basis out of Norway, because we could do it very cheaply from Norway with its consent? Bit by bit, we would reach our 2020 with 5 per cent here and 5 per cent there on each on these methods, but we are fooling ourselves if we think that we can do it with wind alone, and we will make ourselves look like the stupid boys of 2020 because we will be out of line with everyone.</p>

One of the things that I was going to note at the beginning of my own remarks was how good this debate has been. Everyone has been relatively concise, and we have had really good ideas and really enjoyed ourselves. The only fly in the ointment for me was that the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, invited the Minister to Scotland because of his attractions as a Minister, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, clearly because of her attractiveness as the Official Opposition spokesman. I was left out.</p>

I hope that after the election-which I believe is to come fairly soon, though I do not think that he will have to elect himself-he will be back and still on the Front Bench, along with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool, who often speaks on climate change issues as well. I was very pleased to hear that the Conservatives have at last given birth to their energy policy. I think that we have been waiting for this for six months but it has now finally arrived.

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="100323122000004"></a>The Bill is part of the big mission of decarbonisation, as the Minister said, and it contains a number of things that noble Lords have generally welcomed. Carbon capture and storage has met with universal approval, though the views perhaps ranged along a spectrum from scepticism to concern about whether it will happen at all. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, who knows well about these issues, fingered the central problem-that this is taking a huge amount of time. It reminds me of the debate that we used to have on nuclear fusion-another area that we did not err on to this evening-which is always held 50 years ahead of time. With CCS, it always seems to be a matter of another four competitions before we can get round to making the technology work. That is a concern.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="100323122000005"></a>I also welcome the provisions for social tariffs. It is a good move to say to the six main energy companies that this is now going to be on a much more statutory basis. However, given that we have moved from some 1 million people in fuel poverty in 2003 to at least 4 million now, I would be interested to hear from the Minister what effect he thinks this provision will deliver in bringing down the number. The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, was right to emphasise the importance of the subject, which costs an increasing number of lives each winter. On too many occasions people have to make a genuine choice between buying food and buying energy.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="100323122000006"></a>Ofgem has not been discussed at length this evening. We welcome the fact that its remit-though perhaps not its principal objective-very much concerns not just competition but climate change and energy security. Although its prime directive focuses on competition, throughout 2009 we have seen an increasing gap between wholesale energy prices and the prices that we as consumers, even those in fuel poverty, have to pay. We welcome the widened policy but surely this prime directive of competition has not worked at all over the past 12 months. Does the Minister feel that it has not worked? If so, what will be done?</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="100323122000007"></a>We also talked a great deal about provisions that are missing. One area is increasingly important, but we have not yet talked about it and it is not in the Bill: the issue of smart grids or intelligent networks. The Minister will come back and say that we now have a roll-out of smart meters, which all sides of the House have welcomed. However, that is only one part of getting an intelligent electricity and energy grid in this country. I would like to know how we will move this forward in terms of what are called, sometimes quite alarmingly, "smart appliances". It rather worries me that you might go to your fridge in the evening and discover that it has an intelligence of its own. However, one of the key ways in which we can iron out and flatten energy demand is through intelligent devices.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="100323122000008"></a>This will be even more of a challenge because of two other things. First, rightly or wrongly, we in the UK-the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, talked about this a fair bit-do not have a vertically integrated energy system in terms of corporate ownership. So it is difficult  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_935"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 935</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to get a commercially co-ordinated approach with energy companies in relation to these grids. The second area is the Climate Change Committee's report, which we debated earlier this year, and which quite astounded me. It quite abruptly described how the number of electric cars will need to increase in the next decade and beyond to meet our energy and carbon targets. These cars will have a huge effect on the grid, on energy demand and in the need for the quick recharging of batteries. We will therefore have to get our act together very quickly in terms of a smart grid.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="100323122000009"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Oxburgh and Lord Jenkin, talked about how CERT has operated. I was sorry to see that the Bill does not revise the scheme. It has operated only since 2008. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, said, there is a great gap between how it works and operates, the financial accountability of how it works, and the way in which the energy companies discharge this obligation. They may send out several million light bulbs, but that seems too random, not sufficiently financially accountable, and the effects have not been measured. I have always been highly sceptical about giving energy companies-whose expertise is in making money from producing energy-one of the main energy saving targets. It goes utterly against their DNA. I believe that we need to find another way to achieve that.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="100323122000010"></a>The Minister talked about some of the ways in which competition does not work correctly for consumers and in relation to dual fuels. I agree, but I would also remind him that for those living in rural properties-as I do, and as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, does as well-there is no chance even of getting dual fuel; that is, gas through pipelines and electricity. I wonder what the Bill provides for rural users who do not have such opportunities.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="100323122000011"></a>On energy savings and fuel poverty, I do not see beyond CERT, which is not dealt with here, or see a real roll-out of energy efficiency across cities, town and even streets. That is essential for us to meet our carbon targets, yet there is still no credible government policy to achieve this. I believe that that is financially possible, but we do not see those proposals here. Again, this comes back to fuel poverty and the whole area of having to save carbon, rather than increasing our energy capacity.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="100323122000012"></a>Many other areas have been talked about. I will not prolong my comments any further except to mention emission performance standards. It was a tragedy that that provision was not passed by the other House. My noble friend Lord Wallace went through it to some degree. Given the uncertainty about CCS and this sitting on the fence in relation to carbon capture and storage, we need to give the industry some certainty. In any other area, we do that by laying down standards that we expect to be met in the future. Emission performance standards for power stations seems to me to be an obvious way to start this process of emissions standards-we do it for cars, for trucks and for much smaller items of equipment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="100323122000021"></a>The Minister said, on Tuesday 16 March, that the lights will not go out. Why is it, therefore, that his own government statistics show that they will, and that consumer organisations and nearly everybody involved in the energy industry says that they will? Perhaps the Minister was discussing it with his wife and reassuring her about his own home supply.</p>

The next Government, as many noble Lords have said, will have to grapple with the big issues and the future of energy. To give an example, Labour has been dithering for 10 years over a decision on nuclear and are only now, in the dying embers, trying to get to grips with the future. Perhaps they have listened too long to the oratory of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, and the persuasive arguments of his party.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="100323122000023"></a>Is it not shameful that we have more people in fuel poverty when the Government's target is to erase it by 2010? To achieve only a 3.6 per cent reduction in emissions when their own Kyoto target was a 20 per cent reduction is an abject failure, surpassed only by their disgraceful example where their own government building emissions have increased. It is not "Do what I say, not what I do", because they have done neither. No wonder Copenhagen was a failure if they cannot take their own emissions targets seriously.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="100323122000024"></a>Our own energy security is at risk as our gas reserves are only four days, one-tenth of the Germans'. As one expert asked me the other day, why are the Germans better at planning than we are? It defies belief that the Government's own renewable supply target of 10 per cent has not been achieved, despite littering our green and pleasant land indiscriminately with windmills.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="100323122000025"></a>The truth is that the past 13 years have been a vacuum, wasted governance, and it is small wonder that this Government will be known only for spin as they have failed so exaggeratedly to meet any meaningful targets. When the Minister says that the lights will not go out, I, for one, do not believe him.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="100323122000027"></a>I welcome the comments overall from the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, in welcoming the Bill, and those of the noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Wallace. If it be that we do not have time to go through all the stages of the Bill, I still appreciate that generally warm welcome. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has suggested, while the other place is sometimes criticised for its scrutiny of legislation, this Bill has had considerable scrutiny. As I said in my opening remarks, changes were made with amendments brought by the Government in the light of the discussions in Committee.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="100323122000028"></a>I say, though, to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the noble Lord, Lord Marland, that I wholly reject their criticisms of the Government and our energy policy. There are not going to be these large-scale blackouts that the noble Lord says will occur in the next few years. We have developed a strong and coherent energy policy.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="100323122000029"></a>Let us look at the arguments. Yes, plants will close as a result of the large combustion plant directive and the fact that a number of our nuclear power plants are due to go out of commission in the next 10 to 15 years. As I frequently point out to your Lordships, though, we are in the middle of a massive construction programme of new power generation. There is a huge amount-   


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_938"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column 938</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>20 gigawatts-under construction or with planning consent, ready to replace that which goes out of production, with a further 18.5 gigawatts in the consent process. Our modelling shows that for most of this decade, spare capacity, adjusted according to availability, will be around 15 per cent.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="100323122000030"></a>I turn to the issue of gas, because the noble Lord mentioned it. There are 22 storage projects in the process of development. When was the system tested? In the first three weeks of this year, in the very cold weather when demand was at its highest and when Norwegian gas production went down. Yes, four gas-balancing alerts were issued; they were signals to the market of the demand being placed on the system, and the market responded. It showed that we had a very resilient system. I would also point out to the noble Lord and the noble Baroness that import capacity has been increased to 125 per cent of annual usage. As the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, suggested we are in a very good position to take advantage of LNG supplies. We do have a robust system. I could not believe that the noble Lord-</p>

Can he also tell us how many firms with interruptible supplies had to be interrupted and production stopped during the period he has just referred to?</p>

<p><a name="st_199"></a>

I notice that some of my former colleagues in the NHS were whingeing about this. People entered into interruptible contracts because they got a lower price. They can hardly start to whinge if the interruptible contract is actually operated. What seemed to have happened is that some organisations did not know that they had an interruptible contract. I do not think that is the Government's fault.</p>

<a name="100323-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="100323122000033"></a>Regarding this Government being accused of delay in relation to nuclear-we came forward with the White Paper in 2008. We have a decisive policy. We have a very exciting prospect of developing new nuclear power stations. I would point out to the noble Lord that it was his leader Mr David Cameron who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="100323122000070"></a>"I think my policy, green energy first, nuclear as a last resort, is absolutely right".</p>

<p><a name="100323122000068"></a>Then of course during a leadership hustings he called offshore wind farms "bird blenders" and stated that they were not the answer and it was his right honourable friend Mr Kenneth Clarke who said that Britain was unsuitable for wind farms. What we have had from the party opposite over the past few years is a pandering to prejudice and a lack of cohesion. I have not read the full document that the noble Lord's party published on Friday. I have seen enough of it to suggest that it is not the coherent policy that the noble Baroness suggested it was. I do not usually enter into these political issues but I felt I had to respond to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="100323122000034"></a>Let me turn to the much less controversial area of wind. I know that not all noble Lords think that we should put all our eggs into the wind basket. Nor indeed do the Government. Wind will have an important role to play as far as future energy is concerned. All the signs are that there is now real momentum in

The outcome of the third leasing round by the Crown Estate in January showed that companies are prepared to make considerable investment. I well understand the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord James, about whether the supply chain is in place. I understand his point about vessels. We have had discussions. My understanding is that there is considerable and intense discussion taking place at the moment between the developers, the Crown Estate and the Government to make sure we have the supply chain that will supply the necessary infrastructure.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="100323122000035"></a>It is not just wind. The noble Lords, Lord Oxburgh and Lord Palmer, were absolutely right to put emphasis on the other technologies. Last week I visited MCT in Strangford Lough which is a tidal technology which looks to be very promising indeed. The noble Lord, Lord James, said that we were missing out on geothermal. I would point out to him that of course there is potential in Cornwall, the county of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. The Government have made money available to support its development. Of course the noble Lord is right about energy efficiency and about the smart grid. We are not being complacent; we will come out in the summer with much more detail about smart meters, which I see as an essential foundation of a smart grid. We do not underestimate the potential at all.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="100323122000036"></a>I was very interested in the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, about unconventional gas, particularly the potential for shale gas. I am sure that he is right. There are two issues here. The noble Lord did not mention the potential of UK exploration of shale gas and oil. We have commissioned the British Geological Survey to carry out that assessment. He is also right about the potential implications of LNG on our facilities for imports, given that the US is now unlikely to be a strong recipient of LNG sources of supply. Again, this Government's foresight in setting a positive context for LNG import facilities to be developed has come to the fore.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="100323122000037"></a>I was very glad that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham took part in our debate. We recognise that coal gasification has potential. The Coal Authority has recently granted six conditional licences for underground coal gasification, including one in the north-east, and is considering a further five applications. The technical and economic viability of this approach has not yet been demonstrated but we want to play our part in creating a regulatory environment that helps rather than hinders those ambitions. Coal power projects that utilise underground coal gasification will be considered for our planned CCS demonstration programme. So I do not accept that we are lacking in enthusiasm for gasification; we understand its potential.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="100323122000038"></a>I come now to coal and CCS. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and my noble friend Lord Woolmer talked about the importance of coal and of developing CCS technology. The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for coal will increase by some 70 per cent over the period to 2030. That makes it clear that unless CCS technology is developed and deployed, I do not see how we could hope to meet the kind of global emission reduction targets we want to meet. That is the critical importance of carbon capture and storage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="100323122000039"></a>My noble friend Lord O'Neill cautions us about overclaiming what the UK can do in terms of technological lead. I know that other noble Lords think that we are not progressing CCS fast enough. I certainly agree with my noble friend that we cannot afford to be complacent, but the fact is that we are making considerable progress. We have very important coal reserves, which is why CCS is important in this country. But it is also important in terms of what it can contribute to emission reductions globally and the potential for the UK to export technology, skills and the expertise that will be developed as a result of the work that we are undertaking.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="100323122000040"></a>We are making progress. No other coal-dependent country has a policy that no new unabated coal-fired power stations will be built. No other country has developed the kind of financial mechanism that is in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is right that we have recently awarded funding to E.ON and Scottish Power for detailed engineering and design studies. FEEDS-front-end engineering and design studies-are used by project developers to examine and refine initial outlined project plans and reduce technology risk such that a more detailed solution can be drawn up and more accurately costed. That is very important in terms of value for money, which a number of noble Lords have raised.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="100323122000041"></a>These studies will be completed within 12 months, and that is when we will move to the final selection process. It is very much worthwhile for these studies to take place before we make the final decision, but we still hope that the first demonstration project will be operational by 2014. In the mean time, we aim to launch the process of selecting an additional three projects by the end of this year. I can certainly reassure noble Lords that the lessons learnt in the first competition will ensure that the competition in relation to the three other projects will be accelerated.</p>

So I think that the answer is that it should be seen to be in parallel with the competitive process, not in competition with it. Clearly, one hopes that it will be able to take advantage of the money that is being made available.</p>

Is the Minister saying that the Hatfield project would not be able to be considered in the competition for initial funding under the scheme that he proposes?</p>

As I said, I think the money made available from Europe is quite considerable, though I accept that, when we are talking about the development of CSS technology, it is very expensive at the moment. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that I take his point about the exemptions and I will certainly see that they are considered. I understand the point he is making, and, essentially, we have received a number of responses from different sectors about exemption and we will set out the detailed arrangements for the levy in regulations on which we intend to consult in the summer next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="100323122000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, is, of course, right about transportation. I agree with him that we need to think through those issues as soon as we can. On the issue of whether the technology is proven, I well understand the point he is making, which is that all the stages of CCS have been tried and tested. The question is much more scaled up: will it be technically and economically viable? That, it seems to me, is what these demonstration projects are all about. That is why we want to have a very proper and intensive approach to making those judgments. The aim is that by 2018 we will publish a report which considers the case for new regulatory and financial measures to drive the move to clean coal. In the event that CCS is not on track to become technically or economically viable, an appropriate regulatory approach to manning emissions will be needed.</p>

That amount of money will potentially be made available to Hatfield from Europe, but I cannot go into the commercial details. The kind of competition on which we are embarking is extremely expensive and EU funding will not be sufficient to cover the cost of developing CCS in full. I will write to the noble Lord about the details on Hatfield, but I am a little reluctant to say any more about it at the Dispatch Box tonight. I hope that noble Lords will understand that there are clearly commercial sensitivities on that, but I wish Hatfield every success.

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="100323122000051"></a>My noble friend Lord Woolmer asked whether the Government would set an obligation on supplies to source CCS electricity as they have done for renewables. We have no plans at present, and the technology is at a demonstration phase. We would expect the carbon price to drive widescale deployment of CCS in the medium to longer term. I know that there are issues about the carbon price. We are well aware of that, and I have had representations from other technology sectors about the current price. It is not long to Budget and we are publishing two pieces of work. There is, first, a roadmap to 2050 and secondly, the energy markets assessment, which will look at some of those issues and set out an initial analysis of whether further interventions are necessary. I should not say any more about that until it has been published.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="100323122000052"></a>My noble friend asked about oversizing pipes for CO2. We are prepared to consider using the levy to fund investment in pipelines sufficient for full capacity of a coal-powered station using CCS for its entire capacity. The balance that we have to draw is that we need to limit the potential cost to consumers of CCS demonstrations. That is where we are at the moment. On the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, the CCS incentive is specifically designed to support demonstration projects. It is not a deployment mechanism and it would therefore be used only for demonstration projects. We are talking here about the demonstration aspect of CCS. I hope that reassures him. We are not talking just about coal. I agree with my noble friend Lord Woolmer on that matter. I was glad that we made an amendment in the other place to signify that the levy could be used for gas. Given the scale of emissions from coal, we think that it is better to start with coal. However, I have no doubt that if CCS proves to be technically cost-efficient and viable, we shall seriously consider extending it to gas.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="100323122000053"></a>I say to the noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Wallace, that I understand why there is considerable interest in emissions performance standards given their direct relationship to emissions reductions. However, we think that there is a problem with taking this step now before the technology needed to reduce emissions has been demonstrated, given the impact that that would have on investment in new fossil fuel power stations. That is why we think that our approach of taking through the clean coal framework is the most effective way to deliver the emissions reductions that we need in the power sector. As I have said, if CCS does not prove to be all that we had hoped, we would have to consider what other interventions had to be made. We shall debate this on Monday in the context of the national policy statements, but it is worth pointing out that the climate change committee did not recommend the introduction of an EPS at this time. Both the CBI and the TUC have told us in no uncertain terms that introducing an EPS now would significantly undermine plans for investment in new fossil fuel generation plant. That is, and has to be, a real concern.</p>

The whole question of fuel poverty is very important. Rising prices have had an impact on the measures that we have taken to pull people out of fuel poverty, but without that package the number of fuel-poor households would have been around 400,000 to 800,000 higher. The agreement that we reached in 2008 with the suppliers has been valuable. The Bill allows us to give greater direction to the types of households that are eligible for support and ensures that more of the available resources are targeted at all those households that are most in need. My noble friend Lord O'Neill made a very important contribution about the people who are ill and not in receipt of benefits. I will certainly take that back and look at it with my departmental colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="100323122000055"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked me what impact the measure would have on fuel poverty numbers. Clearly, it will reduce the number of households in fuel poverty but I cannot estimate the precise number until the exact detail of the policy is finalised. We will be consulting formally on the structure of the scheme in the summer. At that point we will have an estimate of the impact, but it should not be insubstantial.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="100323122000056"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, in relation to the points that he made about rural fuel poverty, that we are, of course, aware of the difficulties of people who live off the gas grid.

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="100323122000057"></a>I was interested in the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about data protection issues. My understanding is that, in order to comply with data protection principles, the sharing of data has to be proportionate and it must result in a benefit for those whose data are shared. That principle means that data matching was not considered a suitable method to find consumers eligible for assistance under, say, the CERT scheme. The primary benefit available through CERT is energy efficiency measures, and as these measures may not be taken up by those who have had their data shared, data sharing in those circumstances is less likely to be proportionate. However, the energy rebate scheme is a pilot data-matching programme designed to give eligible customers an automatic benefit in the form of a rebate on their electricity bills. So the result of sharing consumers' data in this instance is that they will receive an automatic benefit and, therefore, it is considered proportionate to share these data. I hope that is clear to noble Lords. I suggest that I write to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and perhaps offer him a meeting to talk this through further because I thought he raised a very substantive issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="100323122000060"></a>Moving on to the joyous question of Ofgem, I hope my remarks about Ofgem are always considered to be uncontroversial. I thought the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, put it right. Clearly, there is a major debate to be had about where we need to go in terms of regulation and the kind of market that we need to see in operation over the next two or three decades. It is clear that the political parties have views on this and I suspect that whoever is in the Department of Energy and Climate Change post-election will possibly be seeking a first-session Energy Bill in which these issues may well be discussed. I appreciated the comments of my noble friend Lord O'Neill about the regulatory mechanism and I should like to make two points. First, the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, has some sensible measures in relation to Ofgem which I believe we should accept. Secondly, the work that we are doing with the energy market assessment, looking at future market arrangements, will provide the basis for coming to a view about the regulatory arrangements we need to have in future. I will make one point to the party opposite in view of its own paper. There is always going to be a price to intervention. We have to be careful not to inhibit investment by the companies in this sector because, one way or another, we need billions of pounds of investment to take place now and to increase steadily over the next few years.</p>

<a name="100323-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="100323122000061"></a>We come to the two final areas. First, my noble friend Lord Judd has persuasively put the case for environmental issues to be considered alongside energy issues. I do not disagree with him at all. In essence my department, in accepting the responsibility for climate change and energy, understands those goals and the tensions that sometimes arise between them. However, as for protecting consumers as the grid infrastructure is developed-the noble Lord mentioned the national parks and so on-what I would say to him goes back to our debates on the national policy statements. It is clear that many of these proposals will go for consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission, which will have to take local impacts into consideration. I am sure that the commission will pay close attention to my noble friend.</p>

Just to get words of reassurance from the Government on this would be very helpful.</p>

Very often the major local impacts are during construction. That point is very well taken. The IPC will also have to take account of the cumulative impact. In Cumbria, for example, if three sites are potentially suitable for nuclear power development, the cumulative impact will have to be taken into account alongside all the advantages that such a development might bring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="100323122000066"></a>The points made by the noble Lord, Lord Reay, if I may summarise them, come back to the issue of cost. I do not think that we will agree on this, although I accept the point that he raised about transparency. Every intervention in the energy sector by government through these kinds of mechanisms of course has a cost which is met by energy consumers. I agree with him that it is right that consumers should understand that; I do not think that we can go ahead with all these mechanisms without the public understanding it. It is up to Governments to be open and to communicate why this is happening. I should also say-the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, is not here to dispute this tonight-that the noble Lord, Lord Stern, is absolutely persuasive on the issue that it is much better that we make these interventions now, because the longer we leave it, the

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="100323122000067"></a>I had the privilege of attending briefly the end of a seminar on peak oil chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. Not everyone has a uniform view on peak oil, but one thing that is for sure is that the trends in oil prices are likely to increase. That is why there is a persuasive case for investing in the kind of energy policy that we have, even though it has an impact on energy prices for consumers, in the short term at least. That is why we need to ensure that we have value for money, it is why we need a good regulatory system and it is why, above all, the contents of the Bill, although it is short, will make a modest contribution to those ends.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000003"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="10032399000133"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> My Lords, these regulations are an essential step towards the establishment of commons councils in England, with statutory powers to manage common land. Commons councils will bring together the interests in a common to exercise management control.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000004"></a>The schedule to the regulations sets out the standard constitution which will apply to all commons councils. It addresses such matters as the appointment of council members, the proceedings of a council and the preparation of accounts. Each commons council will be created by its own establishment order made by the Secretary of State, which will set out additional or alternative provisions tailored to its particular requirements. Defra has published two model establishment orders to show how they might supplement the provision in the standard constitution-for example, by designating the number of council members and who will be entitled to elect them. No two commons are the same and this approach will ensure that each council operates under a single core framework but is responsive to local requirements.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000005"></a>A commons council can only be established if the Secretary of State is satisfied that it has substantial support, having particular regard to representations from commoners and others with a legal interest in the common. That is crucial to our approach: the Government  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC314"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cannot impose commons councils on unwilling commoners but can only respond to a call to set one up. The great advantage of commons councils is that they will be able to manage their own affairs by majority voting, hence relieving the difficulty of reaching unanimity among the collective interests. Councils will be able to enter into environmental stewardship and make rules, similar to by-laws, to enforce adherence to good commoning practice and the terms of the agreement.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000006"></a>These regulations follow a consultation which began in September 2008. As a result, we have made a number of modifications, such as to confer greater flexibility for keeping "live registers" of commoners' rights. The next step will be to work towards the establishment of the pioneer councils. Natural England has entered into negotiation concerning the potential establishment of commons councils on Brendon Common, Bodmin Moor and in Cumbria, and has allocated resources for this purpose. We expect the first commons council to be set up late this year or in 2011.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000007"></a>The regulations are part of enabling a long-sought new approach to the management of common land by those who know it best-the commoners, landowners and other local interests. Common land represents about 3 per cent of the land area of England but is exceptionally valued for its contribution to nature conservation, hill farming, recreation, archaeology and culture. This new legislation will play a significant role in improving the management of such lands and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000008"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10032399000134"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations. The very slimline statutory instrument presents an interesting contrast with a highly substantial Explanatory Memorandum, but I suspect that that it is inevitable given the complexity of the issue. I understand the Government's strategy of trying to present a framework that can then be adapted to meet the individual circumstances of particular commons.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000009"></a>A lot of the complexity comes from the fact that commons are occupied in a number of different ways and usually have grazing rights, and the relationship between the commoner or grazier and landowner is often complex. That is particularly so in respect of stewardship schemes; I would be interested in the Minister's view on the way in which environmental stewardship schemes and commons work together. There are circumstances in which landowners have been obstructive on commoners getting involved in stewardship schemes. There have also been situations in which landowners have sought to retain the benefits of the stewardship schemes for themselves, in which case what benefit is there for the commoner?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000010"></a>Getting the balance right is difficult. I understand the concerns. The CLA has written to me, pointing out a number of issues on which it is concerned. It believes that there is a risk in setting up the commons councils, and that the rights of the commoners and landowners can become confused. There is an important distinction between what a commoner and a landowner can do on common land. While all parties will often run their businesses alongside each other in a holistic manner, the lack of understanding of commons law by statutory government agencies has often led to  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC315"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commoners being encouraged to adopt management schemes through agri-environment schemes that the landowner should in fact be involved in adopting or delegating as he thinks fit. That brings us back to the issue that I mentioned.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000011"></a>Therefore, it is imperative that landowners are properly represented on commons councils where the landowner is known. Indeed, the Minister will understand that in certain cases the landowners of commons are not identified as such. There should be no bar to setting up a commons council where that might be the case. There can be a considerable difference in the dynamics of a commons council where the commoners are local and active as opposed to distant and remote. Similar is the case for those with an active landowner-the landowner may be non-existent, as I said, or largely absentee. However, I accept the Government's general premise that the complexity should not prevent the creation of commons councils where they are desired and there is a general belief that they can improve the management of common land.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000012"></a>I would like to ask the Minister a few questions. Two things indicate the challenge of the statutory instrument: the time lag from 2006 to now in getting the regulations tabled, and the sheer thickness of the Explanatory Memorandum. I draw one point in particular to the Minister's attention, because it shows that the Explanatory Memorandum may have multiple sources and have been put together in a hurry. If he turned to page 28 he would see draft accounts, carefully notated-note 1, note 1b, note 2 and what have you-but there are no notes. I have looked through the Explanatory Memorandum and I find them not. I suspect this is indicative of the fact that several documents have been put together to provide an Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000013"></a>I will not labour that point but I have some direct questions for the Minister. On page 6-of the Explanatory Memorandum, rather than the regulations-paragraph 4.1 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000109"></a>"Statutory councils will be formed only where there is substantial local support".</p>

<p><a name="10032399000014"></a>How will this be judged? For example, will support or opposition from the National Farmers' Union, of which I am a member, or the CLA, of which I am not, outweigh that of tenant farmers? Also on page 6, paragraph 5.1 says that,</p>
<ul><a name="10032399000117"></a>"we plan to establish commons councils at a steady pace, so that we cannot achieve our target number overnight".</ul>
<p><a name="10032399000015"></a>Does this mean that the Secretary of State will hold back on approvals if there is a great rush of requests, even if demand is considerable? Does it also mean that the Government, having passed the legislation, have a hidden agenda not to achieve the target? In other words, do the Government really want to play this softly, or are they prepared to respond to demand if local opinion produces a large number of applications?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000016"></a>Turning to page 7, I see that paragraphs 5.2 and 5.4 seem to suggest that the Government may be planning to support the creation of councils in certain areas. In other words, they already feel that a commons council might be useful for particular areas. If this is the case, what criteria have the Government set themselves in  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC316"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>saying that these areas are ones which ought to be looked at? I move on to page 10 and paragraph 5.13, which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000110"></a>"Benefits have not been monetised due to a lack of available evidence ... it is expected that the principal benefits ... will be substantially greater than costs. Work has been commissioned ... This is expected to report in early 2010".</p>

<p><a name="10032399000017"></a>Do we have that report? Where is it? Has it shown the expected benefits or not? I hope that, in asking these questions, I am not probing the Minister too far. It is useful if we have explanations on the record.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000018"></a>Finally, what happens when a commons council runs out of steam? The motivation for setting them up is the enthusiasm and thrust of local people who want to see a commons council in operation. Have the Government a strategy for circumstances in which the people who have engaged in running a commons council find that they do not have the time or interest to support the momentum that originally led to it being set up?</p>

<p><a name="10032399000019"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10032399000135"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, I too welcome these regulations and the ability to debate them this afternoon.

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, has raised several relevant questions, with which I will try not to overlap too much. I welcome the volume of information that we have been provided with this afternoon. Sometimes we get regulations which the Explanatory Memorandum simply rewrites in slightly different-and sometimes not even slightly different-words. This Explanatory Memorandum, particularly the annexes to it, provides a great deal of useful help and information.</p>
<h5><a name="10032399000122"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000021"></a>We have in front of us today the Commons Councils (Standard Constitution) (England) Regulations, a very full impact assessment-which contains a large amount of interesting and useful information-and the rather wonderful draft model orders for commons. One model order is for the West Barsetshire Commons Council-I always think of it as Borsetshire rather than Barsetshire-of which we had a previous version more than three years ago when we debated the Commons Bill. Another model order is for the Barset National Commons Council. The model orders are no doubt closely modelled on the draft proposals coming forward for the three commons councils being considered at the moment, including for the Lake District, which I think we all welcome and look forward to seeing in operation.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000022"></a>My first general point overlaps with that of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor; that is, it seems a long time since we debated the Commons Bill as it went through this House. In fact, I think that it was before the new furniture came into the Moses Room.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000023"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10032399000136"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> It was before I came.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC317"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might have been commenced before January this year. Nevertheless, it has now started and we can get to work. I ask as an aside-the Minister may want to write to me afterwards-how many parts of the Commons Act have not yet been commenced and when do the Government propose that they are? What orders and regulations do the Government expect to publish and bring before the House? Which of the orders and regulations set out in the Act are they not intending to act on?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000025"></a>The proposals put forward for membership of and elections to the councils are sensible. They are flexible in that they will allow each order for each commons council to reflect the circumstances of that common, which has to be right. I see that the Duke of Omnium is to be a member of the Barset National Park Commons Council; I would have thought that he might have been too busy doing all his opinion-polling at the moment, but never mind. The proposals are sensible, and the flexibility built into the system is okay, but it will require a lot of time and effort to adopt and adapt the model constitution to each proposal for a commons council. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked what the capacity of Natural England is to deal with them. The impact assessment suggests that, over 20 years-which is quite a long time, even by House of Lords standards-10 umbrella commons councils might be set up. I presume that they will be the bigger councils for wider areas, including in some cases a lot of commons. Then there will be 29 smaller ones that might include just one common or perhaps two or three together. That is 39 commons councils over 20 years-an average of two a year, which, on the face of it, does not seem to be a huge burden on Natural England. If this proposal becomes very popular and more commons come forward spontaneously-as opposed to those which Natural England is trying to motivate people to set up, presumably because they are in SSSIs or important areas for conservation or landscape according to Natural England's criteria-will the organisation be able to cope or will there be a queue that is not met during this period? Thirty-nine over 20 years does not seem to be a very ambitious target, although perhaps it is not a target but an estimate of the number of councils that there will be.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000026"></a>That leads on to the question of where the applications or processes for setting up commons councils will come from. How many do the Government expect to be led top-down, whereby Natural England goes around the country trying to persuade people to set them up? Perhaps it already has a list of what it considers to be priority places. Is that what will happen? How far will it be able to react as spontaneous applications come in?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000027"></a>The next issue that I want to raise is relatively detailed and arises from the regulations in front of us today, and from the draft constitutions for Barsetshire or Borsetshire. If I read out paragraph 14(2) it will be fairly obvious what is meant:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000111"></a>"The public may, by resolution of the council or committee (as appropriate), be excluded"-</p>

<p><a name="10032399000100"></a>normally the public will be allowed into these meetings-</p>
<ul><a name="10032399000118"></a>"from a council or committee meeting during an item of business in respect of which it is likely that publicity would be prejudicial to the public interest by reason of the confidential nature of that business, or for other special reasons stated in the resolution".</ul>



<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC318"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="10032399000101"></a>Paragraph 15(2) goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000112"></a>"A commons council may exclude from any such publicly available agenda and minutes any information ... in respect of which it has passed a resolution under paragraph 14(2)",</p>

<p><a name="10032399000102"></a>excluding the public. My reading of that is that, first, the argument is rather circular. It says that the public can be excluded because the business is confidential. However, I compare that with local government practice, where the nature of the confidentiality has to be clearly set out in a resolution. It may, for example, be due to a personnel issue, it may be about employees or it may be to do with a contract, a legal case or a number of criteria set out in the Local Government Acts which clearly have to be invoked. You cannot simply say, "You're going out because we don't want you to know what we're talking about". I do not understand why the wording from the Local Government Acts has not simply been lifted and put into these regulations. That wording is tried and tested, it works well, and I think that that would have been the sensible thing to do. People will think that we want something to be confidential simply because it is controversial and we do not want them to know what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000028"></a>Secondly, not having an item on the agenda for the meeting so that people do not even know what is being discussed is not local government practice. Under local government practice, the agenda for the meeting will be published and, if it is confidential, it will be in Part 2. The press and the public will be excluded but they will know that the item is going to be discussed. Equally, excluding an item from the minutes begins to make it sound like the meeting of a secret society. Even if the minutes themselves cannot include confidential details, it is possible to write minutes that refer to a confidential item without necessarily prejudicing its confidentiality. It seems to me that the wording in paragraphs 14(2) and 15(2) does not follow good local government practice and, potentially, if the people on the commons council wanted to run it that way it could lead to it being something of a secret society. I am sure that outcome is not intended, but quite often you have to set down rules and regulations clearly and not just rely on the good nature of the people carrying them out.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000029"></a>My next point is about the cost. I suppose that the Minister will say, "Suck it and see", but what appears to be being said in this documentation is that the initial setting-up costs will be to some extent subsidised by the Government or by Natural England. Can the Minister confirm whether that is the case? The setting-up costs set out here are not inconsiderable, particularly if you are asking ordinary commoners, some of whom may have quite a low-level use of the common, to pay them. On,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000113"></a>"Establishment costs per commoner (one-off)",</p>

<p><a name="10032399000103"></a>on option 3, which is the supported system that the Government are proposing, it is suggested that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000114"></a>"For a smaller council, the cost per commoner would be Â£356. For an 'umbrella' council, the cost per commoner would be Â£294".</p>

<p><a name="10032399000104"></a>That might not be much money for the Duke of Omnium, or for some other large landowner who happens to own part of a common, but it is a reasonably  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC319"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>large amount of money for somebody who is just grazing half a dozen sheep or something like that. On,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000115"></a>"Operating costs per commoner (per annum)",</p>

<p><a name="10032399000105"></a>it is suggested that "for a smaller council", it might be Â£263 per annum, while "for an 'umbrella'" is Â£105. It clearly says that the commons councils have to be self-financing, at least after a certain period.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000030"></a>My questions are: first, are the Government intending to subsidise those setting-up costs-at least for the first commons, to see how they go-and if so, how long will it take for that subsidy to fall away and for the commons to have to pay the whole costs? Secondly, have the Government or Natural England done any testing, perhaps in those three first areas, of whether commoners are prepared to pay that and whether it is therefore a viable proposition? Thirdly, what happens if a majority of commoners on a common are quite happy to pay that money but some of them refuse to pay? Will they be excluded from the commons council but still subject to the rules and regulations that it sets out? Exactly how will that work?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000031"></a>My final point is about the elections, not surprisingly. I think that it says, in the draft West Barsetshire order, that the election of those people who have to be elected from a group, perhaps from commoners or from other groups, will be,</p>
<ul><a name="10032399000119"></a>"by ballot ... at the meeting".</ul>
<p><a name="10032399000106"></a>Given that "ballot" is used, I am probing whether that involves making votes on pieces of paper or whether it can be a show of hands, or whatever. I think that is what is in the model orders.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000032"></a>I am not clear how the election at the first meeting is to take place. Will that be by the secret ballots organised by the returning officer who is appointed by the Secretary of State, will it be by a show of hands, or it is down to how the returning officer feels like doing it at any given time? I assume that if there is an election for more than one person, the commoners-if they have five or six people to elect, for example-will have that number of votes, and if there is a piece of paper that you would be able to vote for that number of people. It does not quite say that, but I am assuming that that is the case. Can the Minister please confirm that? Having asked those detailed questions, I simply reiterate our great welcome for seeing these regulations at last. We wish the enterprise great success.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000034"></a>Any one person can call for a council to be set up. The Explanatory Memorandum says "substantial", but I think that when we had the debate the Minister said that it was a majority. I am not happy to see the word "substantial" if it should be "majority". Some commoners may be in favour of a council being set up and others may not be. I would be grateful for clarification on that.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000035"></a>It has been said that Natural England has allocated resources for the first two proposed councils. Is that just for those two? We are all aware of the current crunch on funding. If funding is not available, will the proposed councils be put on hold for the time being or would it be up to the members who want to form that council to find alternative funding?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000036"></a>I should have declared that I am a member of the CLA and the NFU, but we do not have any common ground to declare.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000037"></a>Paragraph 8.2 refers to the widely differing views expressed in Defra's consultation on costs and benefits. I will be grateful if the Minister will enlarge on what the issues were. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, raised the issue of what happens when people refuse to pay, which I had intended to ask. As in any society, there will be some people who refuse to pay. Do the others carry the extra burden? Are those who refuse to pay entitled to some of the benefits that that council will bring? An important benefit is the opening of the door to agri-environment schemes. It seems slightly wrong that if people are not prepared to pull their weight and take part in the full sense, they should benefit from other people being willing to do that.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000038"></a>Paragraph 9.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum refers to Natural England publishing guidance in April 2010. That is a very few days away. Is it available? It seems strange that we should be debating these regulations when follow-up information is to be made available to us after the event. It does not seem logical, but some aspects of the way we went about the Bill were not very logical.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000039"></a>Figures for the administrative burdens are given on page 3. They are based on 2005 prices. Have they been upgraded? If so, what difference does that make to the figures we are considering today?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000040"></a>Some agreements in force now are voluntary agreements among associations and seem to be working quite well. Will the Minister update us on how many there are and how many of them have indicated that they would like to become full councils? That would help.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000041"></a>The noble Lord also raised closure procedures, which I wish to raise. I suspect that some councils remain strong, but over time some may wilt on the vine. What review will there be of that? What would that council's position be?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100323-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000042"></a>Page 13 refers to "moderate significance" with regard to significance and benefits. I was quite surprised to see that in the significance rating agri-environment schemes are listed only as moderate. One big thrust behind even considering this issue when the Bill came through was the ability of the commoners to be able to access agri-environment schemes, which they would certainly not have been able to before. It would have been the landlords who were able to do that. I am slightly puzzled why it was put down as only moderately important.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000043"></a>From the briefing from the CLA that I have had-and which I suspect that others have had-I raise two other things. There is obviously a difference in role between the commoner and the landowner. Sometimes the landowner is missing; I expressed my views on that  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC321"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>earlier. I think that the councils and the proposals will deal with that well. But sometimes the commoner is involved only in the grazing of the cattle, or whatever else he is holding on the common, so his applying for agri-environment schemes may be looked at in a different way, if he is able to do it, whereas the landowner has to consider the long-term welfare of the environment for biodiversity and everything else, and has to balance that-particularly in moorland areas-with cover for game birds. There is a big issue around management of moors and game birds, and the burning of scrub, for example, which we dealt with when we discussed this in Committee. I have not managed to look in here and find clarification on the issues in which I was interested. Clearly, there could be differing views between the commoner and landowner. I am uncertain in my own mind as to how, even within the commons councils, those diverse issues will be overcome.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000044"></a>Having said that, I welcome this measure. I am sad that it has taken four years, but the benefit is that my noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach is now on the Front Bench. I sit proudly behind him, supporting his efforts on this Bill. We went into great detail on what was considered a fairly small Bill at the time, because there are real, practical issues. I am not too convinced, having waded through the Explanatory Notes and having had briefings from other organisations, that we have got it totally right. If we have not, would the Government's view be to push ahead, or would they have the common sense to delay the authority of this proposal until some of these details have been clarified?</p>

<p><a name="10032399000045"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10032399000139"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who have contributed to this short but intensive debate. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, who gave me some indication of some of the trickier questions that he would ask. I feel slightly better equipped to respond to several of his than I might be to respond in full to those of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. However, I shall do my best on these detailed issues.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000046"></a>First, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, for recognising that the basic structure here is a framework. That is why the Explanatory Memorandum is extensive. The noble Lord is right that it has several component parts, but we seek to create a framework in which there can be a range of variations, not all of which we are necessarily able to foresee at this juncture. I hope to convince noble Lords that we have thought about most of the issues to which they have pointed, and which may lead to difficulty in future.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000047"></a>The model for the whole issue of commons, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has noted, comes from Trollope in the 19th century. The noble Lord must forgive the thoughtfulness of my officials, who have followed the well established pattern that, whenever they refer to a fictitious county, it is always one of Trollope's. You cannot expect to lurch into the 21st century with one or two examples, which might catch one or two of us out-whereas we all feel totally secure, particularly in the upper House, with regard to Trollopian references. That is what we have on this occasion. The noble Lord went on to develop that in his illustrations. These illustrations are against a background in which  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC322"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we recognise that there are aspects of variation, which is why this structure has to be able to cope with the variations.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000048"></a>I emphasise, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that the commons councils will certainly be able to apply for environmental stewardship agreements. The landowner will be expected to join in on consent to the agreement. That is one dimension that we expect to benefit from the structure that we are developing. As with all environmental stewardship agreements, it will be for the applicant-in this case the commons council-to determine how the payments will be distributed among those contributing to delivery of the agreement. Natural England has published guidance on the principles which should be considered in deciding how to allocate payments in relation to uplands ELS agreements on common land. This will be illustrative and instructive when that opportunity develops. We certainly want to see that aspect of it.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000049"></a>I reassure the noble Lord on the rights of landowners in this situation. As I sought to emphasise in my opening contribution, the Secretary of State cannot set up a commons council without consulting all local interests and confirming that there is substantial support for its establishment. He will pay particular attention to the representations of those with legal interests, such as landowners. They clearly have a stake of great particularity and importance in the issue. In all but exceptional circumstances, all key interests in the common, including those of landowners, will be represented on the council.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000050"></a>The concept of the commons council is a consensual one. I cannot emphasise that too much and I know noble Lords fully share that aspiration. We anticipate that disagreements will be few and far between. Certainly, there are no disagreements about the concept of its establishment. If there is substantial objection, the council cannot be formed. We expect all key interests to be accommodated. If no landowner can be traced for the common, or if no landowner is willing to be involved in the council, the expectation of the representation of the landowner with an interest in the common may not, in that case, be fulfilled. Owners will be bound by rules made by the council on, for example, the exercise of grazing rights, as will any other person on the common. However, landowners' rights cannot be ignored, since there is a requirement for a council to obtain the consent of the landowner before undertaking any activities on the land that would normally require the landowner's consent. I emphasise that we have taken that very important consideration into account.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000051"></a>I also emphasise that all the major interests in a common, including landowners, will have the opportunity to be represented on the council. The council needs to be tailored to the local circumstances. That is why we have a framework for the concept of a council. I am not so sure I can even call it a typical council. As the noble Lords, Lord Greaves and Lord Taylor, and-perhaps rather more sorrowfully-the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said, progress on this will not be at speed. There should be great concern about the multiplicity of councils that come forward with a wide disparity of models. We have a framework and each council that is  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC323"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>formed will be tested against that framework. There will be the understanding of variation and sufficient time to take that into account. Anxieties should not be entertained about who will form part of the council.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000052"></a>"Why certain areas?", I have been asked. Do the Government have a favoured piece of Barsetshire that they want to emphasise? No, we will support the creation of councils in some areas, particularly because discussions have already taken place. In my opening statement, I indicated the issue with regard to Brendon Common and Bodmin Moor, and potential issues in Cumbria. These discussions are reaching the stage where those are the likely early initiatives.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000053"></a>In terms of available funding, it is likely that any grant support for the establishment of councils will be limited to circumstances which directly address government priorities and which are of the greatest public benefit-for example, where a council achieves favourable outcomes on a site of special scientific interest. Noble Lords would expect the Government to be more enthusiastic about proposals that met our broad strategy on the development of land. Within that framework, as has been indicated, it is not as though we are anticipating being subject to a flood of proposals. We will be able to indicate where opportunities lie for the development of commons councils against a background of meeting broad objectives.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000054"></a>I accept that there is currently limited research on the monetisation of the benefits of establishing commons councils. These councils have to be encouraged and developed. I accept the criticism-voiced first, I think, by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor-that there had been a somewhat long gap between Royal Assent of the Bill and the commencement of this legislation, and I was not at all surprised to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, echo that point. It is not unusual for noble Lords who helped to bring the legislation on to the statute book to stamp with impatience when action is somewhat delayed. I remember a two and a half year delay over legislation with which I was concerned in the other place, and stamping my foot fairly vigorously about that.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000055"></a>I emphasise that extensive consultation with stakeholders has been taking place to develop a workable basis for implementing this legislation-in particular, the practical model orders and the guidance-and encouraging Natural England's work on shadow councils in order to establish the needs of prospective commons councils. A lot of this preparatory work will be enormously fruitful and, although the work has taken some time, it is right that there should have been a response to the obvious challenges, represented by some of the anxieties expressed this afternoon.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, was worried about the end game, which made me jump a little. I was thinking about the creative part of this legislation and the origins of the councils but he asked me what would happen when one of them folded up. It is open to the Secretary of State to revoke an order establishing a commons council under Section 37 of the Act if a council ceases to operate, but we would expect Natural England to work with a potentially failing council to

I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, will forgive me if, with my usual optimism, I prefer to consider the prospects of success rather than to be too concerned at this stage with elements of failure. However, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is going to emphasise that Ministers should always be concerned with failure.</p>

Of the councils that the Minister is promising may come into existence fairly soon, at least two-the Lake District and Bodmin Moor-have existing structures and there may be existing voluntary commons councils there. I remember my noble friend Lord Tyler waxing lyrical about his history of helping the commoners and landowners on Bodmin Moor to get things sorted out, and we had the noble Lord from the Lake District-</p>

I was remembering his nickname in my head and thought, "You can't possibly say that". He waxed lyrical about the Lake District, its commons and some of the land that he owns there, where people are already co-operating well. They are the easy ones, in a sense. Can the Minister tell us how many apart from the three are in an active queue, as it were, waiting to come forward in the next few years?</p>

I emphasise that Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006, which provides for updating the commons registers, has been implemented in England in seven pilot local authority areas. To ensure that we can learn fully all the lessons from the pilots, we have decided that the decision on how and when to go ahead with national commitments should await the completion of the pilot period in September 2010. Part 3 of the 2006 Act, which deals with consent for works on common lands, and Sections 16 and 17, which deal with exchanges of common land, were brought into force on 1 October 2007. Responsibility for casework consent was transferred to the Planning Inspectorate at the same time.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000061"></a>We have no plans at present to bring into force Section 50, which provides for updating schemes of regulation made under the Commons Act 1899, but we do not think there was any anxiety about the capacity of Natural England to cope with prospective take-up of commons councils. That answers the noble Lord's question. We do not expect a flood; he will have recognised that from the tentative figures. Those figures are an estimate of the rate, not a commitment or plan. Remember that we are dealing with a concept that requires the consent of all concerned and a consensus to emerge. It would be presumptuous in the extreme for the Government to lay down figures that have to be reached. If the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, did not assault me for the heavy hand of central government if I did that, I assure him that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, would not miss that point; he would say that this was all about centralisation. That is not the concept behind this; it has to emerge from local consensual positions. That is the only thing that will work successfully.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000062"></a>As I mentioned, Natural England has explored the potential of the two areas. If there were a surge in demand to establish councils, we would have regard to the probable benefits and costs of each in deciding what resources to allocate. In practice, it is unlikely that a candidate commons council would be encouraged to work up a detailed proposal without resources having been allocated to the project. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, pressed me a little further on this. We expect resources from Natural England, but it is possible that resources would be available from Defra with regard to the establishment of the councils, against an obvious background that we will not run before we can walk. We do not expect a great deal of running to be necessary, because of the nature of the process by which the councils will be set up.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000063"></a>I emphasise to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that we will focus resources on commons where the councils are most likely to deliver our objectives with regard to biodiversity. That does not mean that councils could not be set up elsewhere and meet the criteria, only that priority councils will obviously have first call on resources. They will know the name of the game-that they will have a better chance of acceleration than others if they are able to establish gains in terms of the Government's broad objectives with regard to issues such as biodiversity. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves-and I think the noble Lord, Lord Taylor-hinted at that, but not with the force that he spoke about the concerns about costs. He knows-we have established-that the estimate of a small council's set-up costs is about Â£13,500. I am not minimising that, nor am I exaggerating the resources that might need to be established to take on a few more councils than we expect in the early days. Grant support is potentially available from Defra or Natural England. That support will follow government priorities for rural development. In that respect, the noble Lord's anxieties need not be taken too far, nor does he need to be concerned about process.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000064"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10032399000144"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Will the Minister clarify that the setting-up costs of a commons council, if the Government and Natural England approve and support it, will be paid whole or in part from grants from Defra and/or Natural England? Would those grants pay for some of the running costs for the first year or two before the council got under way? Would the council then be on its own?</p>

<p><a name="10032399000065"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10032399000145"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Those seeking to establish a commons council will know that it will be easier to get access to such support grants if they indicate that they will fulfil benefits consistent with the Government's overall strategy. Therefore, Defra and Natural England will make the resources available. After the start-up costs have been met, the principle is that a commons council will sustain itself. We will make resources available for start-up, but a council then will run itself. It will do so in a democratic fashion-I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, did not think for one moment that there would be any expectation other than that the first election of council members would be by ballot. A returning officer would be established, coming probably from the local authority.</p>

The noble Lord should not be unduly anxious about the council going into secret session-it will not do any of those things. It is not a local authority, with direct responsibility to a wide range of electors. I accept entirely the noble Lord's unexceptionable principles on how a local authority should act and why the rules should be clearly drawn when the council is engaged in confidential activity. There will not be much with a commons council which remotely approaches that, because it will not be a major employing authority with a disciplinary aspect and all those things which throw up unavoidable issues of confidentiality and require those rules. The commons council will after all be a small, consensual council of people working together. We are indicating only that, if someone has a direct financial interest in what is being discussed by the council, it is necessary that the interest be quantified in a certain way and that the individual concerned has rights. Therefore, I do not think that this is a great issue.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000068"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked whether any person could call for a commons council to be set up. Anyone can ask the Secretary of State to set up a commons council but a request which comes from a person with a legal interest in the common, or a proper representative body of such a person, will carry greater weight than a request from anyone else. However, the Secretary of State cannot set up a council without first being confident that all interests have had the opportunity to express a view and that there is substantial support for it. Without substantial support it would not work. You could not set up a council of this kind without there being that degree of support.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000069"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="10032399000148"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> In our discussions when we took the Bill through, we identified "substantial" as being "majority". I raised the issue because there is a difference between "substantial" and "majority".</p>

<p><a name="10032399000070"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="10032399000149"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The problem with "majority" is that you will have to identify with the greatest accuracy everyone who has a right to participate and then count the majority. Of course it will be a majority. By definition, you cannot have a consensual concept without there being a majority opinion. I am shying away from the idea that the council will be computed and set up on a 7:5 majority. It cannot be, because that would not look consensual enough. The concept is clearly one in which the Secretary of State must believe that the council will work consensually. In setting up the council, the idea that significant interests could be overwhelmed by the majority vote would destroy the very concept of the council and its work.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000071"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="10032399000150"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> I did not say that it should be a 7:5 majority but that is where the reference is on the page; I meant paragraph 7.5 of the Explanatory Memorandum. Forgive me; I feel I have misguided the Minister. I am concerned about the difference between the words "substantial" and "majority", and I have laboured the point because, if that is what we agreed, it seems silly to back away from it. If I said "7.5" it was a reference, not a majority.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000072"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="10032399000151"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am not being clear enough and I apologise to the noble Baroness. There is a difference between the council being set up as a consensual model and how it operates afterwards, which is what the noble Baroness may be describing. Clearly the council will be in awful trouble if it wins votes by 51 to 49 and works on that principle. Nevertheless, the noble Baroness is right: in certain circumstances it will be a majority decision. However, I think she and I would agree that if there were too many votes of that kind on a consensual council, the concept of the council would be in serious trouble.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000073"></a>There is an element of force behind what happens when someone refuses to pay. If a commoner refuses to pay a levy set by the council, it will be recovered as a civil debt and, until the debt is paid, the defaulter is excluded from being a member of the council, from voting for a member of the council and from participating in the business of the council. That is to be expected. After all, by definition, if they have withdrawn their financial support they have withdrawn their contribution and their right to participate. There is bound to be an element of compulsion in such circumstances, otherwise the concept of the council working and being able to make a levy would be a complete nonsense.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000074"></a>If any aspect of the standard constitution-this is another point about which the noble Baroness was exercised-as set out in the draft regulations is not appropriate to a particular commons council, different provision can be made in the order establishing that council and the special provision will take precedence. We are looking for flexibility. I know that the noble Baroness could be quite fertile in identifying areas where some special dimension needed to be taken into account and, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, emphasised, we are looking for an element of flexibility in those terms.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000075"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords for what I had anticipated would be a close examination of the nature of these negotiations. What I have also detected from the contributions is that we all want these commons councils to work, where they are appropriate and where there is a will to get them established. We have a framework that will make that possible, and I look forward to the progress that is made in establishing the commons councils.</p>

Those cover,  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC328"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for example, application, refusal and appeal procedures. The funding code's criteria and procedures are being modified under Section 9 of the Access to Justice Act 1999. That section requires any changes to the code criteria, as here, to be approved by both Houses of Parliament before coming into effect. This is done by laying the whole funding code, as amended, before each House, rather than by laying amendments alone.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000077"></a>The funding code does not set out the remuneration arrangements for civil legal aid, which are set out in orders and contracts. Nor does it cover financial eligibility rules for civil legal aid, which are in regulations. The funding code instead covers the test that cases must meet, in the judgment of the Legal Services Commission, in order to merit civil legal aid funding. This merits test includes considering the likely costs of a case against the likely damages and how likely the case is to succeed. It also sets out considerations that apply to cases which are not primarily about money.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000078"></a>Generally, the intention is to model the approach that a reasonable, privately paying client would adopt with regards to litigation, taking into account the importance of the issues at stake, the likelihood of success and all the other circumstances. This helps to ensure a level playing field between those who can afford to litigate privately and those who do not have the financial resources to do so. It follows that public funding should not be provided if a case is insufficiently strong for a private client to risk his or her own money, and to bear the risk of having to pay the costs of the other side.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100323-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000079"></a>The revised funding code before the Committee introduces a number of changes to the operation of civil legal aid. We devote very significant resources to civil legal aid-around Â£1 billion annually-so it is important that we review regularly how that money is being spent, and the cases and matters on which it is being targeted, to ensure we are achieving value for money. Following a review of the funding code by the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Services Commission, we published a range of proposals to refocus and target resources on to more meritorious cases. These changes have not been driven primarily by financial considerations. Indeed, the savings from these changes of Â£5 million per year are relatively modest, compared with the overall expenditure on civil legal aid.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000080"></a>Rather, we have looked critically at the existing funding rules to identify areas where they can be strengthened to ensure that funds are being properly targeted. These changes were the subject of a full consultation last year, and we have had further useful discussions with interested parties following the consultation. As a result of the representations we received, we have very substantially revised our original proposals. For example, we are no longer pursuing proposals to withdraw solicitors' authority to self-grant funding for judicial review challenges to the Government, and we have dropped plans to restrict funding for individual damages claims against public authorities.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000081"></a>In addition to discontinuing some proposals, we have substantially modified many of our other proposals in the light of suggestions from stakeholders. For example, we are acting to restrict legal aid for low-value multi-party action damages claims, but we are retaining  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC329"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>funding for multi-party claims for discrimination, child abuse claims and cases of wider public interest, as suggested by consultees. Stakeholders have expressed gratitude for being fully engaged in the process.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000082"></a>This is a series of somewhat technical changes, and it may assist your Lordships if I summarise the key changes we are making. In section 2 of the code criteria, we have tightened the definition of the wider public interest test so that not only must the case have the potential to produce real benefits for individuals other than the client, but the case must also be considered on its particular facts to be an appropriate case to realise those benefits. This change is to ensure that when funding is sought for a weaker case-one with borderline prospects of success-on the basis that the case could benefit others, it receives funding only if the outcome has a realistic prospect of delivering benefits to others, rather than just a theoretical possibility.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000083"></a>Section 5 of the code criteria sets out the criteria of general application. Here we are withdrawing funding for claims that are part of a multi-party action where the likely damages, as assessed by the Legal Services Commission, are Â£5,000 or less. However, we have retained funding for lead claims as we consider that this will allow legal aid to fund the initial determination of the issue, and further cases can then proceed on a private or conditional fee basis. We are imposing an identical restriction, through the Lord Chancellor's direction on the scope of the Community Legal Service, for out-of-scope cases that are funded on the basis of wider public interest, such as some personal injury claims. The direction is not subject to parliamentary approval, but has been provided to noble Lords for information.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000084"></a>Section 7 of the code criteria covers funding for judicial review. Here we have made two changes. The first is to ensure that funding is available only to individuals seeking a benefit for themselves or their family. Legal aid is intended to assist individuals with their personal legal problems. It should not be used as a tool for those who wish to campaign about matters with which they have no personal connection. It is important that we focus our resources on our priorities, such as debt, employment and housing advice in the current economic climate, and that resources should not be diverted. Of course, campaigning organisations are free to seek judicial reviews, although they are not eligible for legal aid, which is only provided to individuals.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000085"></a>The second change is to remove the existing presumption of funding. The presumption applies to cases of wider public interest, overwhelming importance to the client, or raising serious human rights issues. In practice, the presumption means that where a judge has granted permission for a judicial review, legal aid funding follows without any consideration by the Legal Services Commission of the likely costs or benefits of the case or the prospects of success.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000086"></a>While a judicial decision will always carry very great weight indeed, it is the proper role of the Legal Services Commission to decide whether the use of public funds is justified, and we want to ensure that it is able to carry out this role. While we want these roles to be clear, we anticipate that funding would be withheld in only a handful of cases.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC330"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000087"></a>Section 8 of the code criteria sets out the criteria for damages claims against public authorities. Here we have included an additional prompt by referring to the prison and probation complaints schemes. There is already a general requirement to this effect, but this is intended to highlight the need to consider alternative forms of dispute resolution before commencing litigation.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000088"></a>Sections 12 and 13 of the code criteria relate to mental health and immigration matters respectively. Here we have taken the opportunity to update the references to the tribunals to recognise the reformed Tribunals Service implemented under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. This is not a substantive change to legal aid for these cases, but simply a change in terminology.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000089"></a>The code procedures set out the operational procedures for civil legal aid. Here I shall confine my remarks to the two main changes we are making. Section C15A of the procedures sets out the new process we are introducing to fight fraud. Before legal aid is granted in an ancillary relief or a private law children case, the Legal Services Commission will notify the other party to invite it to provide evidence if it believes that the applicant is financially ineligible for funding. The other party will have 14 days to put forward any evidence, after which funding will commence in the usual way. This notification requirement does not apply to domestic violence cases or to urgent cases, where it can be waived. If the commission receives any evidence that the applicant may not be eligible, it will pass it to its fraud team to investigate or will contact the Department for Work and Pensions if the allegations concern benefits entitlement.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000090"></a>Our intention is to consider this process for all areas of civil legal aid, but the changes before the Committee are confined to private law children and finance cases. We currently receive the highest proportion of genuine representations about client eligibility in these areas and 50 to 60 per cent of representations about client eligibility in these areas are of substance. We have therefore chosen to start the new process in these areas because we are conscious of the risk that the new process may increase the number of vexatious representations made. The new power is drafted as a discretion, so that the Legal Services Commission can roll out the new process gradually. If we were to find that it was not as effective as anticipated, the process could stop and we could reconsider.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000091"></a>Section D of the procedures sets out the new special controls regime. This brings together the existing oversight panels for public interest and multi-party action cases and expands their remit to cover individual weaker cases-those with borderline prospects of success-which depend on the case being of public interest or raising human rights issues to merit funding. Cases subject to the new special controls regime can be referred to the new special controls review panel for advice on their merits, or, where funding is refused, cases will be referred to the panel for reconsideration. The panel will then report and the Legal Services Commission will make the final decision, taking into account the panel's findings.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000092"></a>Some noble Lords have asked why we are making changes to legal aid now, in advance of the transformation of the Legal Services Commission into an executive  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC331"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agency. Transforming the commission into an agency will require primary legislation. It will inevitably be some time before any changes can take effect, so the current system continues in place for the time being. Clearly, any changes we implement will need to ensure that decision-making in individual cases is independent of Ministers.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000093"></a>In conclusion, I hope that the Committee has found this explanation of the revised funding code of help. These are technical but important changes that will help to ensure that funding is directed towards cases of the highest merit. I commend the revised funding code to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10032399000094"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10032399000154"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that clear exposition of what is in this order-except it is not quite an order-on the funding code criteria. It includes some rather wonderful lines. I particularly liked the bit about stakeholders expressing gratitude for being included in the consultation process. We then noticed in paragraph 8.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10032399000116"></a>"The vast majority of responses were opposed to most of our original proposals".</p>

<p><a name="10032399000108"></a>That is rather a good way of expressing their gratitude.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000095"></a>I have a number of fairly straightforward questions which I should be grateful if the noble Lord could address. First, I think it would have been better if the Minister himself could have come to introduce the code-I would have been perfectly flexible about finding a date. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, is, after all, the Minister responsible for these matters and it was he who signed the impact assessment. Therefore, although the noble Lord has done the job very well, I think that the Committee would have been better served if the Minister had appeared before us.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000096"></a>Secondly-here I have some praise for the department; it is always worth offering praise where it is due-I wish to say how impressed I was with the Explanatory Memorandum. I refer in particular to Annexe A, where we are taken through all the changes that have been made in a fairly straightforward manner that is relatively easy to understand, and therefore the number of questions that we might have put are reduced. I also thank the noble Lord's department for sending me a copy of the Lord Chancellor's authorisation with the appropriate amendments. Again, that made life considerably easier when I was examining the document.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000097"></a>My major line of questioning relates to the fact that we presume these changes were designed to make savings. I appreciate that the Minister says that they were not driven primarily by the need to make financial savings but, as he knows, there is considerable pressure on the legal aid budget, and the civil side of the legal aid budget probably seems a much easier target than many. We also know that the department will have to find very large sums of money to meet a number of commitments that have recently been made by the Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor. I think, for example, of the offer of some Â£200 million or thereabouts-the figure varied from Â£50 million to Â£200 million-to those who have developed pleural plaques. Again, I should be very grateful if the Minister could comment on this when he comes to respond but  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC332"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I have heard odd whisperings that that will not all come out of the department's own budget and that other departments might be made to contribute. For example we have heard that, perhaps at a time when the Ministry of Defence is engaged in a war, the Ministry of Justice will be looking to the Ministry of Defence to make sacrifices to meet that commitment. I should be very grateful for the noble Lord's response to that.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000098"></a>The noble Lord says that this code is not designed to make savings. The figure for the net impact is given in paragraph 3.8 of the cost-benefit analysis section of the Explanatory Memorandum. It gives a figure for savings of Â£5.5 million a year, which represents a reduction in the civil legal aid expenditure of just 0.5 per cent after all the work that the Government have put into this. As we see, every possible form of assessment has been undertaken. We have had a competition assessment, a small firms impact assessment, a race equality assessment, a disability assessment, a gender equality assessment and a human rights assessment. It has even been rural-proofed. After all that straining, the Government are delivering a net saving of Â£5.5 million, or 0.5 per cent of the civil legal aid budget. We are very grateful for that reduction but I think that they will have to do somewhat better if they are to get to grips with these costs and with the whole legal aid budget. I refer not just to the civil legal aid budget, which is what we are dealing with here, but to other parts of the budget as well. Therefore, I should be grateful if the noble Lord could tell us whether any more assessments will be done in due course that might lead the Government to find greater savings in that budget.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10032399000099"></a>I do not have any further questions at the moment but I would certainly be very grateful if the noble Lord could address those points.</p>

<p><a name="100323107000001"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100323107000017"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for presenting this statutory instrument for our consideration today. I really do not know why the Government are bothering at this stage, when they have every intention of abolishing the Legal Services Commission and replacing it with an executive agency whose responsibilities are not yet clear. I very much suspect that we will be going through all this again quite shortly, but one or two things need to be said.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000002"></a>First, if the legal aid budget in the sphere of civil actions is to be looked at, surely the very first thing is to ensure that the family Bar is properly provided for. There is a crisis at present in the family Bar, which we have been discussing throughout this year. Nothing in this code assists the family Bar at all. Indeed, I am amazed to discover that the first of the plums that the Minister pulled out of the duff was in relation to the new provisions to allow an opponent in family law proceedings, private law, family, children or finance cases to oppose the granting of legal aid. The Minister referred to vexatious representations. Certainly, in my experience the most challenging and difficult cases are those involving families and children, where the litigants are very much at each other's throats. Since the notice is to be given to the opponent by the legal aid authorities, I can see this giving rise to very considerable conflict and disquiet.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000003"></a>The savings that have come out of this enormous exercise are not great, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, has said. Indeed, the Minister says that having come to the end of it and looked at everything, the code is not designed to make savings at all. The best way of making savings was described by Lord Justice Wall, in the Court of Appeal in the case of SW and KSW v Portsmouth City Council, reported at [2009] EWCA Civ 644. In that case, a stepfather had been accused of raping his stepdaughter. As a result of her accusations, his two children by the mother of all three children were taken into care and were living with foster-parents. That is the sort of issue arising in those proceedings. The stepfather was made a party to the care proceedings but was refused public funding and had to represent himself.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000004"></a>There was a finding-of-fact hearing to ascertain whether the rape allegation was true. Some 14 days were spent on that hearing alone. Lord Justice Wall said that,</p>
<ul><a name="100323107000016"></a>"those who control the court's purse strings simply do not-or will not-understand ... that competent legal representation not only saves time (and by the sensible identification and elucidation of issues makes cases easier for the court to resolve) but that it also saves money".</ul>
<p><a name="100323107000014"></a>He continued,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100323107000015"></a>"I am in no doubt at all that if the appellant had been legally represented before the judge in the care proceedings; (a) the hearing would not have overrun so grossly; (b) the result would have been much more likely to be perceived by all to have been fair; and (c) the cost to the public and the parties in terms of both money and stress would have been substantially less".</p>

<p><a name="100323107000005"></a>The legal aid authorities can best save money by ensuring that the parties in family proceedings are properly represented. That is why I particularly deplore this, since it is in that area that opposition to the granting of legal aid is now to be allowed and considered by the legal aid authorities. I find that very much a retrograde step.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000006"></a>There are also other changes which juggle the Legal Aid Fund around without-quite deliberately-making any particular saving in cost. The whole problem with legal aid is that it has remained at a fairly constant level over many years, for both civil and criminal legal aid. Whereas billions are paid to bankers to keep banks on the road for a very limited period, the Legal Aid Fund has increased, I think, by Â£500 million to Â£2.1 billion, where the ceiling now exists, over the whole period that the Government have been in power-from 1997 to the present. It simply causes problems and expense. I hope that whatever Government may be in power will, in looking at the proposals for an executive agency in due course, look at this artificial cap on legal aid, which has caused the problems that I have outlined.</p>

When I am not being him, I always wish he was here. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for commending the EM. They are extremely important documents. The whole process by which this House encourages improved quality of Explanatory Memorandums is a good thing. I am sorry that the quality of my speech and that of the Explanatory Memorandum means that I do not have any questions to answer on the procedure and criteria.

However, we are here to look at a specific set of changes, which add up to an estimated Â£5.5 million. On their own grounds, they are good and worth while.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000008"></a>As I set out, we consulted over a whole series of ideas. They were considered- perhaps not consensually, but certainly by stakeholders-to be practical and sensible to introduce now. That is why we have done so. If we can usefully say anything further on either pleural plaques or the Ministry of Defence, I will write to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000009"></a>The Government and the Legal Services Commission announced their plans for reforming the way legal aid practitioners are paid in the paper <I>Legal Aid Reform: </I><I>The Way Ahead</I>, published in November 2006. This followed the review by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, of legal aid procurement. These reforms have helped to maintain spending at broadly the same level over the last few years. This has been achieved through a combination of measures, including an extension of solicitors' and advocates' fixed and graduated fee schemes. Spending has remained broadly level since 2003-04 through a combination of measures, including an extension of solicitors' and advocates' fixed and graduated fee schemes, and the introduction of means-testing in magistrates' courts so that those who can afford to pay for their defence do so. Without such reforms, the taxpayer would have been burdened with funding that was Â£250 million higher than the spend in 2007-08, and an increased spend of around Â£600 million more in total between 2004-05 and 2007-08. We are moving to improve management information to acquire a fuller understanding of price and volume pressures, and to support future policy developments to gain better control over cost and achieve greater efficiencies.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000010"></a>The Ministry of Justice will also be well placed to co-ordinate whole system improvements in the justice system. This is being taken forward in programmes such as the criminal justice "simple, speedy, summary" initiative. We recognise the importance of managing costs in all areas of government, but I do not in a sense want to end up apologising for the legal aid system, which is an important part not only of the justice system but of the fabric of our society. We know that in both criminal and civil cases the legal aid system stands behind people who cannot afford to be properly represented in cases in which they should be properly represented-and that is a good thing.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asks why now. I thought I had said why now. We take the view-in fact, it is an absolute fact of life-that moving to an agency will take time and require primary legislation, and no doubt there will be a great deal of discussion about it. I was asked whether we would discuss again all the items from today as part of that. I hope that we will not; I hope that the codes and practices that we have found work will be imported across to any new legislation en bloc and what we are doing today is worth while. I was asked, too, whether these reforms resolve the crisis in the family Bar. No, they do not, and I do not think that they were designed to. I understand that there are problems in the legal profession, and I understand that discussions are ongoing, but at  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC335"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the end of the day these are narrow, technical proposals, which each on their merits, with the exception of one-as far as I can tell from the discussions on this issue-have received universal support.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000012"></a>The process of advising the other party formally 14 days before aid is granted is an extension of where we are now. I understand that it is a voluntary scheme now. It is an extension of a process that has been used in Scotland and been found to work very well. It will produce savings, although, once again, it is quite right to point out that they are modest. The noble Lord mentioned complicated cases; I think that I mentioned the exceptions in my speech but, if not, I shall write. We are introducing this measure in a permissive way, so that it can be rolled out area by area and we can consider whether its value is disproportionately outweighed by vexatious behaviour. The very high relevance rate that we have at the moment with the voluntary scheme, where 50 to 60 points are considered substantial, is a good thing.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100323107000013"></a>While I am sure that everything we do in legal aid is not perfect, I do not think that any of us would demur from what Lord Justice Wall has said-that competent legal representation creates value in terms of both justice and the efficiency of the system. I would hope that the profession is working towards-and that, given the way in which we are commissioning legal aid and announcing various changes all the time, we are all trying to work towards-that concept of competent representation.</p>

However, the regulatory landscape for charities in Northern Ireland is undergoing a major change under the Charities Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly. One of this Act's main reforms is the establishment of the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland as the first independent registrar and regulator of charities in the Province.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000003"></a>Although the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland was formally established last year, it has yet to take on most of its functions, which are set out in the Charities Act (Northern Ireland) 2008. Two commencement orders have been made to date and these have provided for the establishment of the commission, consultation on public benefit guidance, the definition of charity and charitable purpose, and the establishment of the Charity Tribunal for Northern Ireland. A further commencement order is scheduled to be introduced in April 2010 to provide for registration of charities in Northern Ireland and to allow the commission to conduct investigations.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100323-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000004"></a>In order for the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland to take on its functions and begin registering charities, it needs the basic information that HMRC holds on organisations in Northern Ireland which have been recognised as charities for tax purposes. While charity law is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, taxation is not. Matters relating to charity taxation and tax reliefs are reserved to the United Kingdom Government in Westminster, and operational responsibility falls to HMRC. This is why the provisions establishing the information-sharing gateway between HMRC and the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland were not included in the Charities Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 and why the power to make these regulations was, instead, included in the Charities Act 2006.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000005"></a>The regulations will allow HMRC to share information with the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland for the purpose of enabling or assisting it to discharge any of its functions. The power in Section 72 of the Charities Act 2006 under which these regulations are made is very narrow; in effect, it requires the information gateway between HMRC and the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland to mirror the provisions of that which already exists between HMRC and the Charity Commission for England and Wales in Section 10A of the Charities Act 1993. This means that the information shared by HMRC is subject to an automatic prohibition against onward disclosure unless such onward disclosure is explicitly authorised by HMRC. Unlawful disclosure is an offence, although a defence is provided where the disclosure was reasonably believed to be lawful or where the information had already lawfully been made available in the public domain.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000006"></a>These features are the same as in the information-sharing provisions which apply to HMRC staff in Section 18 of the Commissioners of Revenue and Customs Act 2005 and the information gateway which has been established between HMRC and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000007"></a>The Charity Commission for Northern Ireland and HMRC have been working together and have developed a memorandum of understanding covering the practical arrangements for sharing information and for working  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC337"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>together in the future. This is expected to be approved next month. Once the information gateway is in place, HMRC will provide the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland with contact details for all Northern Ireland charities registered for tax purposes. This will be an electronic exchange of information with due regard for information security. These data will be used by the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland to contact charities in Northern Ireland inviting them to register with the commission. In future, there is expected to be a two-way flow of information between the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland and HMRC-for example, about charities that appear to be engaging in non-charitable activities or incurring non-charitable expenditure-to assist each of those bodies in exercising their functions.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000008"></a>The mission of the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland is to introduce a regulatory framework for the charitable sector in Northern Ireland in line with developments in the rest of the UK and Ireland. This will provide a structure and process through which charities can demonstrate their contribution to society, the public can be assured regarding how charities are spending any donations and government can assist in the better governance of the charitable sector.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000009"></a>These regulations may represent a small and technical step in the modernisation of charity law and regulation in Northern Ireland but they will allow the new regulator to get on with its job and will enable charities in Northern Ireland to be officially recognised and regulated as charities in the same way that charities in England, Wales and Scotland are currently. I therefore commend these regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="100323109000010"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="100323109000039"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> My Lords, I welcome the Minister's words. As she pointed out, we have to be aware that an overhaul of the system in Northern Ireland is taking place. I understand that until now there has been no register of charities. Given that the Minister for Social Development, Margaret Ritchie, announced the appointment of the six commissioners-in particular the chief commissioner, Tom McGrath-on 1 June last year, these are early days. We are seeing the introduction of a regulatory framework for the charitable sector in Northern Ireland, which has always been accepted as an exceedingly valuable dimension of the work that is carried on there.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000011"></a>However, the Northern Ireland Charity Commission has only recently been established. In fact, when one checks the internet, there is but a temporary information page, which I accessed a short time ago. There is an ongoing consultation on public benefit guidance that has sought the views of employees, trustees, volunteers and members of the public, mainly in meetings last September and October. Comments were invited by 27 November, and I imagine the work continues in assessing the responses. Therefore my first question is: how does this all fit into the timetable which is now envisaged in this key year-2010-in the evolution of the new charity commission? Secondly, to what extent are there similar provisions in England, Wales and Scotland? The Minister said that there is a comparison to be made. Are we in fact judging like with like and to what extent are these powers identical to those powers that already exist?</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC338"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000012"></a>Thirdly, the consultation on public benefit guidance may well affect the attitude of those involved in the administration of the 7,500 HMRC-recognised charities operating in Northern Ireland. Therefore, is it not premature to ask the HMRC to supply this information before one even knows what is to be the test of public benefit? We are now looking at the birth of a new system: to what extent is this information necessary as the new regulators look forward to setting up a reasonably democratic and identifiable system of registration for the first time? It would be helpful if the Minister could answer such questions.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000013"></a>We know from our debates on Section 72 of the Charities Act 2006 that the disclosure of information under that section would apply only when the body was established. When will that occur? I know that the six commissioners were announced less than a year ago, but to what extent does the Minister regard the system as evolving, or is it already fixed in mind? Provided that it mirrors the restrictions on the disclosure of such information to and from other UK charity regulators, I cannot see any objection to the powers, which are obviously part and parcel of the need to ensure an adequate system. Those of us with knowledge of the charitable sector are already aware of the tremendous bureaucracy involved in it whereas there used not to be any at all; there was hardly any form-filling. I am sure that I speak for all noble Lords in saying that I do not want the charitable sector, which forms such a vital part of life in Northern Ireland, to be overburdened by regulatory requirements and intensive bureaucracy. I am looking for reassurances from the Minister. However, otherwise, one of course welcomes and accepts the need for the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="100323109000014"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100323109000040"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations. I echo what has just been said. When I was in Northern Ireland, I was quite staggered by the imaginativeness, bravery and ingenuity that the charitable sector had to show in order to help Northern Ireland and itself survive during the Troubles. It is good that we are now getting back to a better framework, but I, too, hope that it will not inhibit the remarkable activities of the charitable sector in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000015"></a>We on these Benches support the order, but I have three questions. I am pleased that it is intended that the memorandum of understanding between HMRC and the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland will be compliant with both the Human Rights Act and the Data Protection Act, but will the Minister assure us that both parties are seeking the advice of the Information Commissioner in drawing on the memorandum of understanding?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000016"></a>Secondly, will the noble Baroness give us any detail on how information will be shared between the two parties? Will she assure us that it will be transmitted securely? Given the track record of government departments over the past 10 years or so it is not easy to give that reassurance, but what procedures will be in place to ensure individuals' privacy? How can we be sure that such sensitive information will not go astray?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000017"></a>Thirdly, charity law is devolved in Northern Ireland and we would not in any way seek to interfere with the Assembly's relationship with the Charity Commission  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC339"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for Northern Ireland; however, we believe that there should be a new attitude of respect towards data protection and data security. How can the Government ensure that this culture of respect is developed and applied, not only within government departments but within organisations that report to Parliament and the devolved Administration, such as the CCNI?</p>

I endorse the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, who was impressed by what he saw in Northern Ireland as far as the charitable sector is concerned. I also endorse the views expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, that we do not want the charitable sector to be overburdened by regulatory requirements and that we live in a new, modern and transparent age where people want to know where their donations are going, what will happen to them and whether charities are regulated properly. It is important that that is the case.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000019"></a>A number of questions were put to me. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked about the provisions for Northern Ireland's information gateway and whether they are equivalent to those in Scotland, England and Wales. I hope I can reassure him that the gateway between Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland must mirror that which exists between Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Charity Commission for England and Wales. I will write to the noble Lord on Scotland as I do not have that detail.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000020"></a>The regulations in front of us ensure that the interplay between Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the charitable sector in all parts of the UK is the same. That is the case as far as England and Wales is concerned, and I will write to him on Scotland.</p>

Can she reassure us also that the exchange of information is working well and that if there are any lessons to be learnt from the way in which it has proceeded in England and Wales, they will be taken on board as HMRC considers the best way to communicate with the new authority in Northern Ireland?</p>

<p><a name="100323109000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, also asked about the timetable for the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland. Revised public benefit guidance is to be published in April 2010, which is only a month away. Once transfer of data has taken place, registration will commence on a phased basis during 2010-11. The noble Lord pressed me on whether we were almost there or up and running. On the journey we are taking, we are almost there. Once these regulations go through, registration can commence, on a phased basis,

As I understand it, it will be up to those organisations which feel they are providing public benefit to make application and, when those applications are received, no doubt they will be adjudicated upon by the new regulator. To what extent will the information flowing from the HMRC come in before, during or after the consideration of the applications that are being made? That is my point on the timetable and it would be helpful if the Minister could outline how it is going to happen.</p>

<p><a name="100323109000025"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100323109000045"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> The registration has to take place first. This will be basic information-taxation reference numbers, names, addresses and so on. The charities can then be contacted by the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland because it will have their addresses and basic information in front of it. After that, there will be a phased exchange of information between the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, including whether there are question marks about certain charities and so on. So it will be registration first, then contacting the charities and then starting the exchange of information.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000026"></a>The noble Lord asked about the timetable, which I have gone through with him. The noble Lord, Lord Clifton, asked about the risk of loss of personal information and referred to past experiences in this field. Both the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will ensure that information is disclosed in a secure, efficient and proportionate manner. I understand that a secure e-mail is being set up and that all the information will be passed electronically. As soon as these regulations are agreed, we will be ready to go.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000027"></a>The staff at the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland will be civil servants, so there is that security. Those who will be able to use this information gateway are at present undergoing mandatory information security training, which will conclude by the end of this month.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000028"></a>Underpinning all this, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, knows, is the fact that it is a criminal offence for any unlawful disclosure of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs information, which, on conviction, could result in a prison sentence of up to two years. We feel that we have robust systems in place to cope with the transfer of this amount of information.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, asked about sharing data with the Information Commissioner. That will be the case-that information will be shared with the commissioner.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100323109000030"></a>I think that I have answered all the questions put to me but I shall check <I>Hansard</I> to see whether I have.</p>

<p><a name="100323114000001"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="100323114000056"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My Lords, I shall also speak to the second and third Motions in my name. These orders help to implement the vetting and barring scheme under the 2006 Act. Two are from the Department for Children, Schools and Families and one is from the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000002"></a>The 2006 Act reforms arrangements for safeguarding children and vulnerable adults from the risk of harm by workers with significant access. The scheme covers two categories of work: regulated and controlled activity. Regulated activity is most of the scheme, covering specified settings, activities or posts, such as work in schools, caring for children, or treating the sick. Controlled activity covers fewer posts, mainly in further education or health, outside regulated activity. These do not involve activities such as caring, but give an opportunity for contact with, or access to, sensitive records about vulnerable people.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000003"></a>The scheme creates different safeguarding measures for each category. The first order narrows the circumstances where work is regulated activity and so an individual must register with the Independent Safeguarding Authority, or ISA, as we now refer to it. The controlled activity regulations introduce a narrow arrangement to exist only while we roll out the scheme. It closes a safeguarding gap by requiring employers, before employing individuals in controlled activity, to check whether they are barred from regulated activity. The third instrument, amending the exceptions order under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, enables the arrangement created by the controlled activity regulations.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000004"></a>The first order narrows the scope of regulated and controlled activity, which partly depends on work being intensive, so that work is only intensive if it takes place on more than three days in a 30-day period. Previously we specified work on more than two days. This implements a recommendation by Sir Roger Singleton, accepted by the Government in December. The order also adds to regulated activity a small number of specialised categories, which cover relatively few people, and lets the ISA share information with the police in Scotland and Northern Ireland to help us to join up safeguarding across the UK.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000005"></a>The controlled activity regulations create interim arrangements to prevent the risk of certain employers appointing people without knowing whether they are  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC342"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>barred. The regulations require employers to ascertain whether individuals are barred from regulated activity before letting them start a controlled activity in England. Welsh Ministers have laid before the Assembly draft regulations making provision for Wales. Modifications to the Police Act in the regulations that we are debating cover England and Wales, and support both sets of regulations.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000006"></a>Regulations 2 and 3 state when an employer may permit an individual to engage in controlled activity. They apply only to permitting an individual to start controlled activity after the regulations come into force, and the scheme will provide a new checking service for this. If the person is barred, the Criminal Records Bureau will issue an enhanced criminal record certificate as usual. If the person is not barred, and if entry into controlled activity is the only reason for the application, the CRB will issue only a notification, with "not barred" being the response.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000007"></a>We aim to avoid an individual starting in controlled activity without an employer knowing of a bar from regulated activity. While the law does not prevent a barred individual applying for controlled activity in England, we want to enable any employer choosing whether to employ in such cases to be aware of the applicant's status and history.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000008"></a>The purpose of issuing only a notification where there is no bar is to balance providing information for safeguarding vulnerable groups with keeping the information disclosed proportionate. Notifications will state "not barred" without disclosing any cautions or convictions. This is in keeping with the Government's aim of supporting rehabilitation of offenders by limiting how far rights to CRB disclosures are extended to workers. We intend this requirement to last until we replace it either by permanent requirements for workers in controlled activity generally to be ISA-registered, which we plan for 2015, or by any alternative arrangements that emerge from a review of controlled activity recommended by Sir Roger Singleton, on which we plan to consult shortly.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000009"></a>This is an interim arrangement. It is light-touch, with no criminal penalties for non-compliance. Its purpose is to give legal backing for making checks that responsible employers want to and should make. If Parliament approves these regulations, they should come into force on 1 April, subject to final confirmation of operational readiness. The CRB is about to consult on a fee for the checks. We expect nearly all employers to receive a "not barred" notification, which will cost less to produce. Therefore, the fee should be under Â£10, which is much less than the cost of "ordinary" disclosures.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000010"></a>I apologise for a minor error in the drafting, which will be corrected before the regulations are made. Regulation 9(6) refers to a regulation in a previous order. It should refer to an article. The regulations make minor changes to when the ISA must automatically bar a person, adding any Channel Island or Isle of Man offences that equate to England and Wales offences. Finally, they make minor amendments to tidy up the treatment of a few Scotland and Northern Ireland offences.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC343"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000011"></a>The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 provides for certain convictions, after a period of time has elapsed, to be deemed as "spent". Ex-offenders are not required to disclose their spent convictions for most purposes-for example, when applying for most employment or for insurance-in order to aid their resettlement into society. However, we have to balance rehabilitation with the need to protect members of society from people who pose a risk to them. To that end, the exceptions order exempts particular employers, bodies and proceedings from the general provisions. As a result, sensitive areas of activity, such as work with vulnerable groups where there are particular opportunities to abuse trust and cause harm, are excluded from the Act's regime by the exceptions order, and the employer is entitled to a CRB check containing details of spent convictions. This allows employers to make a fully informed decision on whether an individual may safely be offered a post in that area of employment.</p>
<h5><a name="100323114000051"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000012"></a>The controlled activity regulations propose to entitle an employer to an enhanced CRB check if an individual has been barred by the ISA. Therefore, a very limited amendment to the exceptions order, to exclude that situation from the Act, is necessary to underpin this narrow scheme. It gives employers the chance to do that check. Permitting disclosure of spent convictions in these circumstances does not mean that an individual is necessarily prevented from working in controlled activity. Rather, it ensures that the employer is fully aware of the history of that person and can choose to put appropriate safeguards in place if they offer employment.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000013"></a>The other provision in the exceptions order relates to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. In 2009, this House passed an amendment to extend the exceptions order to cover the Channel Islands as part of the process of extending the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act to the islands. Following this amendment, Isle of Man Ministers requested that a similar provision be made for them, so that they might also be protected by the vetting arrangements being introduced in England and Wales and to prevent any possibility of those who are barred from working here moving to the Isle of Man to avoid detection.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000014"></a>In order for those working on the island to be subject to vetting by the ISA, and for their employers to be able to obtain CRB disclosures, it is necessary that they are covered by the exceptions order. For the sake of clarity and logic, the provision aligns Channel Island and Isle of Man provision. However, it makes no substantive change to the law in relation to the Channel Islands as made by this House in the 2009 amendment. The provision as it appears in the draft order has been agreed to by the relevant authorities. I hope that noble Lords agree that the instruments take useful steps towards underpinning the Government's commitment to safeguarding vulnerable groups in our society. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC344"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>how best to protect the public, especially the young, from those who pose a risk to them. To this end, it is important that people who have committed serious crimes do not end up being responsible for vulnerable groups. I doubt that anyone would object to that as the principle behind the orders. However, like other secondary legislation which has followed the 2006 Act, the instruments before us today will fuel even more concern and confusion about the Government's policy in this area. It is a serious and delicate area which we cannot afford to treat lightly. Regulation should be well thought out, rigorous and robust, but what we have before us is not. I therefore have some questions for the Minister.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000016"></a>The Singleton recommendations advised the Government to review the need for controlled activity policy. What consideration did the Government give to this advice and why does it appear from the orders today that they have ignored much of it? It has been asked whether it is reasonable to expect employers and voluntary organisations to implement the regulations in their current form, and how easy it is determine whether an individual is covered by the rules. The lack of clarity around the rules has led to confusion about vetting and barring, among not only people on the ground but the public in general. Are the Government satisfied that the scheme is easily accessible? I remind the Government that, on Report on the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, Members in another place called a vote on this communication issue and still, many years later, the problem persists.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000017"></a>There have been reports of mistakes when information about individuals has been sought and returned with the employers being told that potential employees have a criminal record when they did not. Mistakes have been rectified later, but by then the job, or the opportunity to have one, has passed-that is, if that mistake ever gets rectified and how easily. There are instances where individuals still bear the scars of incorrect information being returned. Can the Minister tell the Committee what data security safeguards are in place to ensure that people's information is protected?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000018"></a>While the need to protect vulnerable groups is paramount, we must be confident that we are making a proportionate response and that we assume people are innocent rather than guilty. The Government have managed to create an atmosphere in which we are all guilty until we prove that we are innocent. It is costly and complex and, yet again, a symptom of the Government's inability to trust people. What is required is a system which is rigorous but simple for employers and other organisations to implement.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000019"></a>Can the Minister tell us what she expects the likely cost to businesses to be? I am aware that voluntary organisations will not have to pay, which is a good thing. However, there are already organisations and regulations in place to vet potential employees. Is the Minister sure that there will not be duplication of roles, paperwork and, more importantly, costs? It should go without saying that we must be extremely careful not to impose additional burdens and bureaucracy on business if it is not absolutely necessary, and that, if we are to, we at least owe business the decency to make new rules as easy to abide by as we can.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC345"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000020"></a>What analysis and assessment has been carried out to measure the impact these orders will have on the rehabilitation and re-employment of ex-offenders? Can the Minister tell the Committee what proportion of offences against children and vulnerable adults were committed by first-time offenders, and how many offenders would have been caught by this register? I presume there would have been none if the register works only after conviction. If there are a significant number of first-time offenders, we must surely warn the public that this legislation does not tackle them and that they still need to be vigilant. I shall raise a significant point that was not answered in another place. Can the Minister tell the Committee what the Government are going to do to warn the public that these provisions in their current form do not automatically guarantee 100 per cent protection? This legislation does not address the serious issue of vulnerable children in their own homes.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000021"></a>Can the Minister say what these orders will cover? I notice that one of the statutory instruments clearly states that it is for England only. The other does not, but both have England and Wales in the title. Furthermore, one of the statutory instruments reads as if it will apply to Northern Ireland as well. In the other place the Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100323114000049"></a>"There will be a UK-wide scheme-it will be the same scheme-but because of the relevant powers ... it will be necessary for Welsh Ministers to make the arrangements".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Delegated Legislation Committee 15/3/10; col. 5.]</p>

<p><a name="100323114000047"></a>I listened carefully to the Minister, but I would like some clarification on this area. Can she tell the Committee what she anticipates these arrangements will be and whether they will be identical to those before us today? If there is a chance of any deviations, what procedures will be in place to rectify any loopholes or confusion?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000022"></a>Overseas workers make up a large proportion of the workforce, particularly in healthcare and schools, and the number is ever increasing. What progress have the Government made on imposing proper procedures to obtain conviction data for overseas workers? Can the Minister tell the Committee whether our European partners have equivalent systems in place? If they do not, this fails to protect us from workers coming in from the EU. I am worried, largely due to the lack of clarity and explanation by the Government, that the measures will give a false sense of security as it is clear that they will not capture everyone. The Government need to explain more about why these measures are the right way to go, how many people will be affected and how they will make people safer. I look forward to the Minister's answers.</p>

<p><a name="100323114000023"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="100323114000058"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, these orders have resulted from the rigorous work of Sir Roger Singleton. I notice that he has chosen a very appropriate title for his report: <I>Drawing the Line</I>. That really goes to the heart of what we should be doing-that is, drawing the line in the right place to ensure that we do as much as we possibly can to protect children and vulnerable adults, without putting an undue burden on conscientious employers, employees, volunteers and public agencies. On these Benches, we judge all these things on whether they are proportionate.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000024"></a>Sir Roger made some very sensible recommendations, most of which the Government are now trying to implement. However, I notice that, although the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC346"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Explanatory Memorandum indicates that there will be a considerable reduction in the number of people who will be affected by the need to register because of the changes to the frequency and intensity rules, there is no detailed assessment of the impact of those changes on the protection of children and vulnerable adults. Can the Minister say what the Government have looked into before implementing those recommendations?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000025"></a>I share some of the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, about overseas workers. Whenever this Committee has discussed orders to do with things that came out of the 2006 Act, we have always taken the opportunity to ask the Minister for an update on the Government's negotiations with other countries about the sharing of information. I look forward to the Minister's reply on that point.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000026"></a>In another place, there was great concern about communication-not surprisingly, because every time you make a change, it adds further confusion. I compliment the Government on the <I>Mythbusters</I> document, which is a very good way of trying to counter some of the outrageous and inaccurate claims that have been made in the media. It is important that documents of that kind are very widely distributed and that very clear guidance is given to employers, potential employees and volunteers about what they have to do, particularly given the penalties that will result from not doing it.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000027"></a>Three points came out of Sir Roger Singleton's report which are not dealt with by these orders. I take the opportunity to probe the Minister a little on three of the recommendations about further work that Sir Roger made at the end of his report. First, he asked whether private medical practitioners should be looked into, as well as whether they should register. I think the Department of Health is taking the lead on looking into that. Can the Minister tell us what co-ordination is going on between her department and the Department of Health and who is being consulted on that matter? Secondly, how will the Government approach deciding whether there is any need for the controlled activity category to continue? This is another matter that Sir Roger raised. Will the Government ask Sir Roger to look into it further? It was beyond the remit of his original report, which is why he raised it at the end. Thirdly, he raised the issue of whether there will be a continued requirement for CRB checks.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000028"></a>This brings me to some anecdotal information, which I can pass on to the Minister. In the past four days, I have met four people who work with children and vulnerable adults who have four concurrent CRB checks. One was a volunteer who runs a cadet force in a school. He has to have one CRB check for the school and another for the military for the same voluntary job. Then he works in another school, doing some coaching, so he needs another CRB check for that. Finally, he volunteers in an old people's home, so he needs a fourth CRB check for that. This afternoon, I met a young teacher who works in two different schools and is on sabbatical from a third. He has three CRB checks for those three different schools and is a school governor in a fourth, so he has another one for that.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>

What are the Government going to do to stop this waste of time and money? Until November, when the new registration scheme comes in, it is all we have.

<p><a name="100323114000030"></a>Finally, can the Minister tell us anything about another matter that the Government have asked Sir Roger Singleton to look into: the physical punishment of children in part-time learning situations? The Government have indicated that they expect him to report by the end of the month, but as far as I can see there will be no legislative opportunity for the Government to put his recommendations into operation straight away, as they said they would. Does the noble Baroness have any further information than she had the last time I asked her about this-which was nothing-on how the Government are going to approach that matter?</p>

<p><a name="100323114000031"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="100323114000059"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I thank both noble Baronesses for their contributions and for participating in this debate, which is an important act of scrutiny of these important orders. I have had quite a lot of questions; I will do my very best to cover them all now but, as ever, if I do not or miss any answers, I undertake to write to the noble Baronesses. My right honourable friend in another place has just written to honourable Members in response to their debate. Some of the questions that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, touched on were picked up there, so we are addressing them. I apologise if I am not going about this in the right order, but here goes anyway.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000032"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked whether we have made an assessment of the negative effect of the whole scheme on ex-offenders in finding work. We have made a great effort to ensure that the exceptions that these provisions make to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act are as narrow as possible. That means that, as much as possible, we are trying to leave standing all the work that people have been doing around the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act to get it right. The only entitlement to details of spent convictions in relation to controlled activity is if the individual concerned has been barred by the ISA from regulated activities, which means that the ISA has already deemed a person to pose a risk to vulnerable groups. We estimate that the CRB might get around 5,000 applications a month, of which between one and five might be barred. It is a tiny proportion.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000033"></a>Both noble Baronesses asked how we deal with foreign offences, which I know is a matter of concern. As they know, we deal with them in several ways. Since the EU decision in 2005, an EU member state must inform the UK if a UK national is convicted in other EU states, as the noble Baronesses are aware. A standard for exchanging information electronically is being developed and the CRB is pursuing bilateral agreements on exchanging information for employment vetting purposes. We know that a prospective employer in the UK can also ask an applicant from overseas for a police certificate of good conduct. We would obviously also expect employers to take up references and to  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC348"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>check with previous overseas employers, but that is of course an imperfect system. We rely on the sound judgment of employers, but we are working to create as strong and proportionate a system as possible.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked about the coverage of the scheme. I think the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, also asked, but perhaps not. To be clear, the scheme as it relates to regulated activity-where people on the barred lists are prevented from working-applies in England and Wales under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act, and parallel legislation in Northern Ireland provides similar arrangements there. So there is some alignment. The only difference relates to the different structures there; for example, the existence of health and social care trusts and education and library boards rather than local authorities. The ISA is the barring authority in both England and Wales and Northern Ireland, and an ISA bar is already recognised in those countries.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000035"></a>I do not want to focus on too much detail, but Scotland will have a slightly different scale operating under the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act. However, it is important that we intend to recognise Scottish bars and Scotland intends to recognise ours, so a person barred anywhere in the UK will be barred across the whole UK. It is therefore right to describe the system as a UK system.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000036"></a>Arrangements may be made for controlled activity in Wales which are different from those for England. However, the Welsh Assembly Government intend to make the same interim provisions for controlled activity in Wales as we intend to make for England. In Northern Ireland, employers are entitled to obtain enhanced disclosures on all workers in controlled activities, not only on those who are barred, and therefore there is no need for these interim arrangements. Scotland will be covered in the same way.</p>

<p><a name="100323114000037"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100323114000060"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> Will Scotland be covered with regard to controlled activity?</p>

<p><a name="100323114000038"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100323114000061"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> Scotland does not have controlled activity; that is the difference. I shall set that out for the noble Baroness when I write to her.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000039"></a>The noble Baroness referred to concerns that this scheme is about people who work with children, whereas a great deal of child abuse takes place in families. That is an area of concern and that is why last week we launched our report on the progress that we have made on the review of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, on safeguarding in the UK. We are working to make sure that we have a safeguarding strategy across the piece but we can never be sure that people who work with children are perfectly safe. The scheme does not promise that and we are careful not to raise expectations. Our communications need to be crystal clear on this. The scheme complements, for example, safe recruitment and employment practices; it excludes those who pose a risk-the barred people-from regulated activity and gives information about them to employers; but it does not indicate that there is no reason for someone not to work with children. We have to be clear about what the scheme can do, as both noble Baronesses have said.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000040"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked for clarity about who is covered in controlled activity. The Government issued detailed guidance on this last week,  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC349"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including case studies and examples to illustrate the coverage of the scheme. I shall be happy to copy that information to the noble Baronesses and we shall be interested to receive any feedback from them.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000041"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was concerned about security. The ISA has new IT systems which are built to the Government's confidential criteria and are more secure than any other government IT system.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000048"></a>Vigorous safeguards mean that personal information is properly protected and cannot be downloaded from the system or accessed from less secure computer systems. The ISA has set in place a robust security system. Any potential breaches can quickly be identified and dealt with through audit, and we are confident that we are well placed effectively to deliver our security requirements. These are, as the noble Baronesses would expect, also reviewed and tested on a regular basis.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000042"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, wanted to know what the Government's position is on the Singleton recommendations. When Sir Roger published his report, we accepted his recommendations and clearly indicated to him that we would need to operate interim arrangements pending the longer-term consideration of those recommendations; otherwise, we would have barred people entering into controlled activity and employers would not even know that they had been barred. Therefore, we have had to tighten up the loophole that we identified, but this is a light-touch requirement to prevent the risk of barred people entering into controlled activity. We accept Sir Roger's analysis, and his suggestion that the scheme can be simplified is very helpful.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000043"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was interested in knowing the percentage of convictions in England and Wales given to offenders with no previous criminal history. The figures that I have for autobar offences-those where the offender is automatically placed on the barred list, either with or without representations-show that in 2008 46 per cent of convictions in England and Wales were given to offenders with no previous criminal history. That is quite an interesting figure.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000044"></a>I agree with the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, about the impact of mistakes and wrong information being supplied to employers. It is an extremely important point on which to focus in these deliberations. In the event that a dispute is raised by an applicant, the CRB works with the relevant police force to ensure that the dispute is resolved very swiftly and ensures that the registered body-the employer-is made aware that any information released in a disclosure has been disputed. That swift action is important. In accordance with Treasury policy, the Criminal Records Bureau makes financial awards to redress customers for maladministration. Again, that is important. The CRB also awards customers for any loss of earnings that arise as a direct consequence of the CRB's maladministration. Again, I hope I can reassure the noble Baroness that we take this very seriously.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000045"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, touched on a point about which I, too, feel very strongly-that is, getting the communications right. I am glad that the myth-busting document has been helpful. A host of communications has been prepared and is in train as we go towards the July 2010 deadline. However, we recognise that it is important to make sure that  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC350"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parliamentarians are properly informed as well. We produced detailed guidance about the scheme in October 2009, and, as I said, full guidance was released last week. We have been publishing information about the scheme in various media, as one would expect, and have just finished a large-scale and, I am advised, well supported sequence of roadshows, which are about going out and talking to those who will be using the scheme.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100323114000046"></a>We are advised that the feedback that we have had from the roadshows and surveys that we have conducted indicates that there is general support for the approach that we are adopting with the scheme. We should feel encouraged and reassured by that. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked for more detail on overseas workers, but I will write to her with the latest update on that.</p>
<h5><a name="100323117000057"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000001"></a>With regard to working with the Department of Health, this is, I believe, about self-employed private health practitioners in particular. As the law currently stands, when the patient attends one of these practitioners, it will be a private arrangement. Therefore, although the practitioners may register with the scheme, there will be no requirement for them to do so. However, the intimate nature of the medical treatment may suggest that these practitioners should be registered. The Department of Health will lead on this in collaboration with the DCSF and healthcare regulators. I hope that, by the time I write to the noble Baroness, I can tell her how closely we are working on that. I worked very closely with Phil Hope and other Department of Health Ministers on several issues. The whole vetting and borrowing scheme is pressing ahead apace. It is not the just the DoH that we need to work with; we also work with the MoJ and the Home Office. I recognise that that is very important.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000002"></a>We are launching consultation on the timetable for the review of the CRB checks today. The noble Baroness made a good point from the case studies that she described, which I absolutely recognise as an important issue that this consultation on the use of CRB checks must address. I hope that the noble Baroness will be happy to share the details with me so that I can look at them further. My view is that ISA registration, particularly for volunteering, must be a great step forward for all those who volunteer and work in different settings. We must work towards making this an effective, user-friendly, proportionate system.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000003"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="100323117000065"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> I declare an interest as a provider in social care. The difficulty, which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, picked up very strongly, is that these sectors already have great difficulties in recruitment. If CRBs are not transportable, the sector suffers and those people who desperately need the jobs are left very much in a world of limbo. CRB checks need to be transportable, as they once were, rather than different CRB checks being needed for different organisations. It is duplication, yet again.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000004"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100323117000066"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> We need to remember that the beauty of ISA registration is that once you become registered, your registration is monitored and you can take it with you wherever you go. If you work in a regulated activity and change jobs a lot or have several different jobs, your ISA registration will work.  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC351"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC351</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>All you have to do is give your employer or the charity for which you are volunteering your registration. That employer, with your permission, can then check your ISA registration and see that you are not barred from working with children or vulnerable adults. That has to be the ultimate in portability. What we have to do through the consultation that we are launching now is look at what that means for CRB checks. We in government have to tread gently in looking at this. Many employers value the entitlement to have a CRB check. We want to get the balance right. We do not want to create turbulence in the system at a time of change. I value very much the points that the noble Baroness made about that. I see portability being one of the most important aspects of this whole scheme. I would hope that in a few years' time, the noble Baroness would see the benefits of the scheme going forward in that way.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000005"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Verma, talked about the importance of a proportionate approach. Before coming in here today, I was thinking that it needs to be proportionate, fair and consistent. But we do have to make it proportionate, which is why we asked Sir Roger Singleton to undertake his check. <I>Drawing the Line</I> is a good name for his report; we needed to look at whether we were drawing a line in the right place, and Sir Roger's report helped us to do that. It is safe to say that public opinion has moved on significantly since all of us were here for the debates around the Act following on from the Bichard report. His recommendations, which we have accepted in full, are widely supported, and most people accept that activity once a week should be covered by the scheme, as he recommended. Our aim throughout has been to develop an approach that is proportionate, balanced and effective, with the scheme operating in a way that is neither burdensome, bureaucratic or off-putting to potential volunteers, which meets the concerns of parents and families.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000006"></a>As for the question from the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about physical punishment, I am advised that the report will be published very shortly and that we will respond to it as quickly as we possibly can. With regard to whether there is time to act on the recommendations, I am looking forward to having many more months to take forward anything that I may learn from a new report that Sir Roger Singleton might do for us. I am not unduly worried about the timescale.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000010"></a>The first regulations are being made under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979.

Their purpose is to increase the amount of compensation paid under the 2008 mesothelioma scheme, so that payments are made at the same level as those paid to mesothelioma sufferers or their dependants under the more generous 1979 Act. In addition, both sets of regulations provide for the majority of dependants who receive awards under the

These new amounts will be paid to those who first satisfy all the conditions of entitlement on or after 1 April 2010.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000011"></a>Noble Lords will be aware of the background to the 1979 Act, but it may help if I briefly recap. A person who is injured or contracts an industrial disease as a result of working for a negligent employer may sue the employer for damages. However, some diseases, especially those which are dust-related-for example, mesothelioma, caused by exposure to asbestos-can take a long time to develop and may not be diagnosed until many years after exposure to the agent that caused the illness. By that time, the employer responsible may no longer exist, resulting in people experiencing great difficulty in obtaining compensation for their illness.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000012"></a>The Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 was introduced to help such people by paying lump-sum compensation to sufferers of certain dust-related diseases, or to their dependants, if they are unable to pursue civil action because their former employers have ceased to carry on business. The 1979 Act covers a number of respiratory diseases, most of which are directly related to asbestos exposure, including mesothelioma, pneumoconiosis, asbestosis, diffuse pleural thickening and primary carcinoma of the lung. The non-asbestos-related diseases covered include coalworkers' pneumoconiosis, caused by exposure to coal dust; byssinosis, caused by exposure to cotton dust; and silicosis, caused by exposure to silica, among slate miners for example. Noble Lords will need no reminding that all of these are terrible diseases and a heavy legacy of our industrial past.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000013"></a>Following the transfer of responsibilities for the 1979 Act to the DWP, we made a commitment to uprate the levels of payment under the Act annually. Traditionally, we have done so in line with increases to industrial injuries disablement benefit payments. Noble Lords will be aware that receipt of IIDB is one of the eligibility criteria for 1979 Act payments. Like other non-income-based social security benefits, IIDB is usually uprated in line with the September retail prices index. As a result of the recent global downturn, however, RPI moved into negative territory for the first time in around 50 years, standing in September 2009 at minus 1.4 per cent.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000014"></a>That negative inflation would have meant no increases in those social security benefits uprated by RPI, with those relying on them seeing their benefits frozen in cash terms from this April. As such, my right honourable friend the Chancellor announced in last year's Pre-Budget Report an increase for key carer and disability benefits of 1.5 per cent from April, providing help to people now, when they need it most. This includes an increase in IIDB. We are passing the same increases on to the 1979 Act payments.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000015"></a>From April 2010, the maximum amount payable to a person under the 1979 Act will increase to Â£75,176 for a person aged 37 or under at diagnosis. The actual amount of money paid as a lump sum under the scheme will of course vary for different people, based on the age at which they are diagnosed and their level of disability. The highest amounts are paid for those diagnosed at an early age and for those with higher

That compensates for the poor prognosis associated with terrible diseases like mesothelioma and for those who are younger at the point of diagnosis, who will therefore die at a younger age.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000016"></a>As I said a moment ago, one of the key diseases that the 1979 Act was designed to compensate for is mesothelioma. It is a particularly unpleasant and fatal disease, caused almost exclusively by exposure to asbestos. Those with mesothelioma often have a short life expectancy and experience complex, debilitating symptoms. I am afraid that the number of deaths from mesothelioma in Great Britain has risen substantially during the past 30 years and continues to rise, with the peak not expected until sometime between 2010 and 2015. In 1968, 153 people died from mesothelioma. By contrast, in 2005, there were more than 2,000 deaths. Between 2006 and 2020, we expect that up to 30,000 people in the UK will die of the disease. Put another way, estimates indicate that one out of every 100 men born between 1940 and 1950 will die from the disease.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000017"></a>Although people who develop mesothelioma through their employment have access to lump-sum payments through the 1979 Act, there was previously no provision for people who developed mesothelioma but not as a consequence of their employment. We recognised that this was a weakness in the provision of compensation and, to remedy the situation, we introduced in 2008 the new mesothelioma scheme. The scheme provides for the first time lump-sum payments for mesothelioma sufferers who have been exposed to asbestos but not in the workplace. They may, for example, have been exposed to asbestos through a relative who worked with asbestos, or by living near to an asbestos-producing factory, or from self-employment. Prior to the commencement of the 2008 mesothelioma scheme, those people, whose suffering is as great as those who develop this dreadful disease as a consequence of their employment, may have had no other means of redress.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000018"></a>Up to the end of February 2010, 743 mesothelioma sufferers and 74 dependants had received help from the scheme. The amounts payable to sufferers ranged from a minimum of Â£8,197 to a maximum of Â£52,772, with an average amount of around Â£16,000 being paid.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000019"></a>The cost of the 2008 mesothelioma scheme is met by compensation recovery; that is, compensation recovered from individuals who are successful in a civil damages claim but who have already received a payment under the 1979 Act or the 2008 scheme. When we started the scheme in 2008, we set awards at a level consistent with the amount of recoveries we expected to make. This meant that payments through the 2008 scheme were lower than amounts payable to mesothelioma sufferers under the 1979 Act.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000020"></a>When we introduced the 2008 scheme, we made a commitment to increase the level of payments to match amounts payable to people with mesothelioma under the 1979 Act at the earliest opportunity and as levels of compensation recovery allowed. We expected to be able to do so in the scheme's third year of operation, in 2011. I am very pleased that we are now able to deliver that commitment from April, only 18 months after the scheme started.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC355"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000021"></a>From April 2010, therefore, lump-sum payments from the 2008 scheme will increase by around 40 per cent to the same level as those paid under the 1979 Act, taking into account the 1.5 per cent increase to 1979 Act payments. The minimum payment to sufferers therefore increases from Â£8,197 to Â£11,678, and the maximum from Â£52,772 to Â£75,176. This is the first increase in the amounts payable under the 2008 mesothelioma scheme since its commencement on 1 October 2008. It is our intention in future years to maintain parity in the rates payable under both schemes.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000022"></a>The third element of this package of regulations is an increase in the level of payments made to dependants under both schemes. Currently, payments made to dependants under both schemes are at a much lower rate than those made to sufferers during life. We recognise the terrible effects that these diseases can have on families, who have to cope with the effect of the disease on their loved ones, witnessing their pain, suffering and, ultimately, their death. While we acknowledge this by making payments to the families of people who die from these diseases, payments have been at a much lower rate than those made to sufferers during life.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000023"></a>That differential in payments puts pressure on sufferers during already extremely difficult times. For example, many feel that they need to rush through a quick claim to the department in order to maximise compensation for their families. Some are too sick to make a claim before dying and therefore their families are able to claim only the lesser amount after the claimant's death. In addition, because mesothelioma is difficult to diagnose and the disease onset is rapid, some sufferers are not diagnosed until after death.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000024"></a>We have listened to the argument put forward by stakeholders and parliamentarians that the difference in payment is unfair and unhelpful. To help families to cope during these extremely difficult times, dependants will now receive an increase of up to Â£5,000 above the current pay scales. This brings the rate of payment between sufferers and dependants closer together and goes some way towards our commitment to bridge that gap. Dependants who already receive close to the amount paid to the sufferer will receive a proportionate amount, bringing their award up to the level of that paid to the sufferer in life.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000025"></a>I am very pleased that these schemes are now performing an important role, providing substantial financial support at very difficult times. However, I am aware that this success is a sad reflection of the rising number of people being affected by asbestos-related diseases. Noble Lords will, I am sure, agree that, while no amount of money will ever compensate individuals and families for the suffering and loss caused by mesothelioma, those who are suffering rightly deserve some form of monetary compensation, and it is essential that sufferers receive compensation before it is too late.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000026"></a>These regulations increase the levels of support through the government compensation schemes; they help to ensure that mesothelioma sufferers are able to receive the same amount of compensation from the Government, regardless of whether the disease is a consequence of their employment; and they go a long

The regulations will make a real difference to people in extremely difficult circumstances and I commend them to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000027"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="100323117000071"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations, which I welcome. Although I do not think that I need to declare an interest, I mention that my father died of mesothelioma a few years ago, albeit before the 2008 scheme was introduced. However, I can attest to the speed and severity with which these lung diseases attack and kill those who have been exposed. I welcome the proposals both to have higher rates for people with mesothelioma and for that payment to go to dependants as well to get rid of the anomaly and extra time pressure that the differentiation created.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000028"></a>I am also pleased that statutory payments for pneumoconiosis are being uprated in line with the industrial injuries disablement benefit, which is increasing rather faster than inflation. It is proving to take quite a long time to process payments, and this uprating at least provides some compensation for the delays.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000029"></a>When debating, on 5 March, the Damages (Asbestos-Related Conditions) Bill introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, my noble friend Lord Henley probed the Minister a little about the establishment of a working group to speed up the payments to sufferers and their dependants. I was hoping that we might be able to hear a little more about that group today. Can the Minister give us some more details?</p>

<p><a name="100323117000030"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="100323117000072"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> My Lords, I too, thank the Minister for explaining the detail of these important regulations and giving much of the background, particularly the numbers of those affected under the schemes. I am also grateful to the department, particularly Susan Parker, who explained how the compensation scheme worked-in particular the fact that sufferers do not face a long wait before receiving a pay-out. From these Benches, we fully support the regulations which increase the rates of payments made under both the 1979 Act and the 2008 scheme.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000031"></a>The diseases we are talking about are, as we have heard, very serious respiratory diseases brought on by people working with asbestos, living near an asbestos-producing factory, or perhaps even living with someone who worked with asbestos. As the Minister said, these diseases do not always manifest themselves until 20, 30 or 40 years later, and when the most serious-mesothelioma-is diagnosed, the prognosis is grim, as the noble Lord, Lord Freud, has testified. These diseases are not confined just to the industrial heartlands of the country, but are found across the UK-for example, in workers who many years ago produced brake linings in the car industry. The incidence of mesothelioma is expected to peak in about five years' time, which was something of a surprise to me, since the dangers posed by asbestos itself have been known about for a long time now.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000032"></a>I pay tribute to the Health and Safety Executive, which has done a great deal to make sure that the working environment is now much safer than it was when these devastating diseases, caused by exposure  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC357"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC357</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to asbestos dust, were contracted. The HSE often gets an unwarranted bad press and we should pay tribute to its work in this as well as other areas. While on the subject of the use of asbestos, I do not know whether the Minister can confirm that, although its use has been banned in this country for some time, it is still being used in many countries in the developing world. I hope that information on the dangers to health is being shared, perhaps through embassies.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000033"></a>Legislation was introduced in 1979 to help those diagnosed as suffering from a dust-related industrial disease by a lump sum payment, in addition to any industrial injuries disablement benefit. This was, as we have heard, because many employers could not be sued since they were no longer in business, so compensation was very difficult to obtain. I gather that the DWP is at the moment consulting on improving support for people who need to trace employers' liability insurance policies to obtain compensation for an accident or industrial disease. Although the Association of British Insurers and the Lloyd's Market Association have committed since 1999 to a voluntary code of practice for tracing employers' liability insurance policies, there are still believed to be more than 3,000 people who are left without help. I believe the Government now propose to establish both an employers' liability tracing office and an employers' liability insurance bureau to oversee this process. Perhaps the Minister would confirm this. Could the Minister also tell me whether retired members of the Armed Forces, who contracted mesothelioma while serving, are covered by these regulations?</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000034"></a>The 2008 mesothelioma scheme, which, as we have heard, pays out a lump sum to those ineligible for the original 1979 scheme because they contracted the disease through environmental exposure, is wholly funded from compensation recovery. It is good news that the level of civil damages received is higher than expected at this point and that, therefore, all payments are being increased to the 1979 level from 15 April so that the amounts are equalised to all sufferers, however they contracted the disease. It is also good news that awards to dependants will be increased by up to Â£5,000 by way of a lump sum.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000035"></a>It is worth making it clear that the 1.5 per cent uprating we are talking about in relation to the regulations under the pneumoconiosis Act is a draw-down from next year's uprating, and is not an uprating in its own right, so to speak. It will therefore not be consolidated into the base level for future upratings. I do not envy the job of whoever is the Minister in having to explain next year's uprating. In closing, I reiterate that we fully support these important orders and send our sympathy to all those suffering from these terrible diseases and their dependants.</p>

It is a great sadness to hear of the personal experience of the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and his understanding of the impact of mesothelioma on individuals and their families.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000037"></a>The noble Lord asked about the working group on the processing and the time in which claims may be paid. With regard to the 1979 Act, claims are processed  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC358"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>within six weeks, and claims under the 2008 scheme within nine days on average. Previous debates have recognised that.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000038"></a>As for the working group on process to which the noble Lord referred, that refers to the processing of civil claims, which was mentioned in Jack Straw's pleural plaque Statement. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="100323117000056"></a>"We will therefore establish a working group composed of claimant solicitors, trade unions, insurers, the judiciary, and civil servants to examine litigation practices and procedures for compensation claims relating to mesothelioma, and identify options for streamlining them in order to reduce the time taken to conclude cases. In particular the working group will consider ... the operation of the Practice Direction for court proceedings introduced in April 2008 to ensure that it is working effectively ... possible solutions to difficulties arising from delays in obtaining medical reports because of the shortage of medical experts in this area ... why more claims don't settle, and whether any provisions in relation to pre-action behaviour would be helpful in reducing the time taken to establish liability without the need for court proceedings ... We also intend to consider changes to the substantive law to ... resolve difficulties experienced by mesothelioma sufferers as a result of differences in the value of claims which are settled before or after the death of the person concerned and to clarify the limitation period for bringing a claim ... clarify that the limitation period for bringing a claim runs from the date that the claimant becomes aware that he or she has mesothelioma rather than from the date they became aware of the original exposure to asbestos" <I>[Official Report, Commons, Col. 81WS]</I>.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000052"></a>That is a relatively new Statement. I hope that that puts the matter into context.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000039"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, gave her support to these regulations, and I am grateful for that. She made reference to the fact that the instance of mesothelioma has yet to peak. One challenge of this terrible condition is its long latency period. That raises all sorts of issues. The noble Baroness praised the HSE, which I was pleased to hear, as that does not happen often enough. It does lots of work at the moment trying to spot what might be the long-term latency issues of other modern practices-for example, nanotechnologies-and what that might mean in future.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000040"></a>The noble Baroness said that asbestos is banned in the UK but not in the developing world. I regret that asbestos is still commonly used in the third world; my understanding is that it is commonly used in India, both in processing and uncontrolled environments, such as ship-breaking. The HSE works closely with colleagues abroad, and I shall certainly ask them to continue to share their expert surveillance. The noble Baroness asked about Armed Forces personnel; they are not covered by these regulations, but they are covered by separate arrangements provided by the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p><a name="100323117000041"></a><b><a name="100323-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="100323117000074"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> Could the Minister write to me with the arrangements for the Armed Forces, if members suffer from mesothelioma? That would be very helpful.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000043"></a>The noble Baroness asked, too, about proposals around employers' liability insurance bureaus and the employers' liability tracing office. We fully appreciate the difficult situation facing individuals who struggle to trace a relevant insurance policy. While the vast majority of individuals are able to find an employer or  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC359"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>insurer to claim against, that does not in any way reduce the distress and difficulty faced by those who cannot. I also accept that those individuals are disproportionately likely to suffer from long-tail diseases such as mesothelioma and that on top of the terrible disease they face a lack of compensation. That is why we have the 1979 Act and the 2008 scheme.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000044"></a>In addition to providing government support to individuals, we want to ensure that people can access civil compensation. We have therefore been working to improve people's ability to trace employers' liability insurance policies. In 1999, in conjunction with the insurance industry, we launched a voluntary code of practice to help to trace these policies where other routes have failed. The code has led to some improvement, but there are still too many people who are left without help. The Government do not think that is acceptable and therefore believe that more must be done.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100323-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="100323-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000045"></a>Therefore, on 10 February, we launched a consultation on two proposals to improve the situation. We agree that an essential first step is the creation of the employers' liability tracing office to manage an electronic database of employers' liability insurance policies and to operate a tracing service for insurers and individuals. We envisage that the database will initially be voluntary but will in time become mandatory to provide a complete record of all employers' liability policies issued. A tracing office along these lines will be a significant benefit to many thousands of people who need to trace policies. The ABI is already driving forward work on this proposal, which will take into account consultation responses.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000046"></a>While a tracing office will ensure that in future more people can obtain civil damages for industrial disease, we know from experience that it will still be difficult to trace historic policies, especially for individuals suffering from long-tail diseases. We therefore also propose to establish an employers' liability insurance bureau, as suggested by a number of stakeholders and parliamentarians. It will provide a fund of last resort in cases where all other efforts to trace an employer or insurer have failed. This will give peace of mind to many workers who know that they were exposed to asbestos but who do not now have symptoms. They will have confidence that if they later develop an asbestos-related disease, they will be able to claim the civil compensation to which they are entitled.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC360"></a><b>23 Mar 2010 : Column GC360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100323-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000047"></a>The consultation is examining issues such as what the bureau should cover, the impact on insurers and employers, how much should be paid by way of compensation and the limitations on claiming from the bureau. The Government will consider fully the responses to the consultation before determining the next steps towards the bureau's introduction. We believe that the changes we are proposing will make a real difference to the lives of people who suffer from these terrible work-related diseases and to their families.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000048"></a>The noble Baroness asked about contributing to the consultation. The consultation document and guidance on how to respond were sent to key stakeholders and are published on our website. We are also holding a series of consultation roadshows in Leeds, London, Bristol, Manchester and Glasgow. We have invited stakeholders to give face-to-face feedback.</p>

<a name="100323-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="100323117000049"></a>With the exception of one point, I think I have covered each of the points that have been raised. The noble Baroness is quite right about the 1.5 per cent increase. As we discussed on another occasion, we believe that it is important to give some people extra support now, but the 1.5 per cent will be deducted from the full uprating a year from now.</p>

I can now report on the implementation of the apprenticeships provisions of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 and specifically how each of the commitments I gave will be taken forward.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10032374000007"></a>We are currently working to establish a detailed timeline for the development of regulations. Specifically, we have begun preparatory work in relation to the regulations that are to be made under Part 1, and in Part 4, Sections 92 and 95, using the anticipatory exercise of powers provision in Section 13 of the Interpretation Act. The timeline for regulations to be laid, subject to the will of Parliament, is as follows:</p>
Part 1, with the exception of Section 1(5) relating to the alternative completion conditions-we expect to lay regulations in autumn 2010, and they will come into force in April 2011. The regulations in respect of Section 1(5) will be laid in spring 2011 and come into force in September 2011; and Part 4, Sections 91-99 will come into force in April 2013. Regulations to be made under Sections 92 and 95 will be laid in the summer of 2012 and come into force in April 2013.

At that meeting it was agreed to establish a small working group, chaired by Peter Little OBE, to consider and make recommendations on the specific flexibilities that the regulations should contain in relation to Sections 92 and 95.

This work will also help to provide clarity on the scope of the proposed flexibilities and allow sufficient time for local authorities, delivery partners and learning providers to make appropriate preparation and provision for the regulations before they come into force in 2013.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10032374000010"></a>A clear lead from the top that the recruitment of disabled apprentices should be a priority, with no less priority being given to disabled young people than they currently enjoy from the Learning and Skills Council, will be given.</p>

<a name="100323-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10032374000011"></a>We fully acknowledge that inequalities within the apprenticeship programme remain a challenge. Overall, the latest data show that of the 73,000 people who started an advanced or higher apprenticeship in 2007-08 only 9 per cent considered themselves to have a learning difficulty/disability/health problem. These inequalities are not unique to apprenticeships-they are mirrored in the wider employment pattern-but many apprenticeships are still more segregated (by gender, ethnicity and disability) than the rest of the corresponding sector's workforce.</p>

<a name="100323-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10032374000012"></a>I can assure the House that disabled young people will be no less a priority for the chief executive of Skills Funding and the chief executive of the National Apprenticeship Service than they are currently. I have asked the Joint Apprenticeship Unit in my department and the Department for Children, Schools and Families to work with the National Apprenticeship Service to ensure that the service meets the commitment I  gave to the House on increasing the proportion of learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities in apprenticeships; and that equality and diversity is a key priority for their second year of operation and for the future. The National Apprenticeship Service is working with employers to help them understand and be more responsive to the needs of learners from underrepresented groups; and to promote apprenticeships to those underrepresented groups, their communities and key influencers, including parents, teachers, community leaders and support workers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10032374000013"></a>I am able to report also that initial discussions have taken place between the Joint Apprenticeship Unit, the National Apprenticeship Service and the Department for Work and Pensions to explore how additional learner support funds and the access to work programme can form a package to support better those learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities to take up and sustain employment with training as an apprentice.</p>

<a name="100323-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="10032374000040"></a>DROs were introduced in April 2009 following research that identified that there were people in long-term debt difficulties who had nothing to offer their creditors and who could not afford to make themselves bankrupt. Delivered in partnership with the professional debt advice sector, DROs provide low-cost easy access to debt relief for those overwhelmed by relatively low levels of unmanageable debt. They are designed to provide a fresh start for the most vulnerable people trapped in debt.</p>

<a name="100323-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="10032374000041"></a>There are strict eligibility criteria of assets less than Â£300, debts no more than Â£15,000 and surplus income of less than Â£50 per month. But because a pension is treated as an asset, some people who would otherwise qualify find themselves unable to apply for a DRO because they have pension rights based on a pension that has a low current valuation. This consultation examines a number of options designed to make the system fairer for these people. In particular, we propose asking whether a pension should not count towards the value of assets provided that the current valuation is no more than either Â£1,000 or Â£5,000 or Â£10,000; and/or where the individual cannot draw down the pension for at least five years or 10 years. We also intend to ask whether there should be an additional requirement that the pension scheme must be one that is approved by HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="10032374000073"></a>As I announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on 27 January, the Libel Working Group was set up in response to concerns about the possibility that our libel laws were having a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Members of the working group reflected a range of interests and expertise, including organisations campaigning for free speech, claimant and defendant lawyers, media organisations, newspaper editors, and the academic and scientific communities.</p>

<a name="100323-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="10032374000074"></a>The working group's terms of reference were "to consider whether the law of libel, including the law relating to libel tourism, in England and Wales needs reform, and if so to make recommendations as to solutions". The group focused on identifying key priorities relating to libel law in England and Wales, but did not consider issues relating to costs in defamation proceedings, where work is already under way.</p>

<a name="100323-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="10032374000075"></a>The Government have taken a number of steps to control costs in defamation-related proceedings, ensuring that, where after-the-event insurance is taken out, defendants are notified as early as possible, and given the opportunity to reach a settlement without being liable for the insurance premiums. Defamation proceedings are now part of a mandatory costs budgeting pilot, with judges scrutinising costs as cases progress to ensure that they are proportionate and within the agreed budget. In addition, the Government are seeking to reduce the maximum success fee in conditional fee agreements in defamation-related proceedings to 10 per cent as an interim measure so that the specific concerns around high costs in these cases can be addressed as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="100323-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="10032374000076"></a>The working group's report was submitted to me last week, and will be published on the Ministry of Justice website today, together with the Government's response to the consultation on the multiple publication rule, and copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. I would like to express my gratitude to all the members of the working group for contributing their knowledge and expertise and for the considerable amount of time and effort that they have put into considering these important issues and producing their analysis and options for reform within such a tight timetable.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="10032374000077"></a>On the basis of all the views that have been submitted, the Government are convinced that reform of the law on libel is needed, and that action should be taken on a number of aspects of the current law and procedures. We will take steps to implement the necessary changes on as timely a basis as possible. However, in some instances primary legislation may be necessary. Where this is the case, we propose to develop our thinking further and come forward with detailed proposals to include a draft Bill for introduction as soon as parliamentary time allows in the new Parliament.</p>

These focus on a tightening, and so a more rigorous application, of the rules and practice in relation to service of defamation claims out of England and Wales where the court's permission is required, in order to head off inappropriate claims at the earliest possible stage. We believe that the  working group's proposals in this area will provide effective practical benefits, and intend to raise them with the Civil Procedure Rule Committee and encourage the committee to consider them as soon as possible; and other procedural issues that have been raised in the Libel Working Group report and elsewhere, for example relating to changes to procedures to strengthen the defamation protocol governing pre-action behaviour and to resolve difficulties relating to decisions on the meaning of allegedly defamatory material at an early stage.

This form of testing was first introduced in the spring of 2006 and intensified in 2007, and is intended in the main to protect herds in low-incidence areas that might receive animals from high-risk areas. Herds in low-risk areas are precisely the herds that are monitored under the bovine TB indicator as part of Public Service Agreement 9 (PSA 9) and that tend to be skin-tested once in four years. The indicator commenced

Since it would take up to four years for any reduction in bTB infection resulting from pre-movement testing to show its full effect on skin-testing results, we would expect any effect on the PSA 9 indicator to continue into 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a><a name="10032379000040"></a>Although the apparent year-on-year reduction in bTB incidence in new parishes (despite the increase in numbers of herds and animals tested for bTB in 2009) is welcome, the Government remain cautious and do not want to read too much into the short-term disease trends, given the cyclical and multifactorial nature of bTB incidence in the endemic areas. The incidence of bTB in parts of England is still far too high for EU standards and we continue to take the fight against the disease very seriously, not least because of the serious impact it has on farmers.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_82"></a><a name="10032379000111"></a>There are no such plans at present. The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) provides the Information Commissioner with the power to serve information notices, which require data controllers to provide such information as is necessary to determine compliance with the data protection principles. Where an information notice is served on a data controller who processes personal data for the special purposes of journalism, art or literature, the Information Commissioner must first consider whether the data in question might be processed for one or more of those special purposes, and hence whether a special information notice might be more appropriate. Information supplied under a special information notice should allow the Information Commissioner to determine whether information is indeed being processed for special purposes or not. Information processed for special purposes is exempt from certain requirements under the DPA.</p>

<a name="100323w0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_83"></a><a name="10032379000112"></a>Additionally, the DPA provides for the Information Commissioner to carry out a good practice assessment of any processing of personal data, with the data controller's consent, to assess compliance with the data protection principles. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 introduced a new power for the Information Commissioner to serve an assessment notice on government departments which would allow him to enter their premises to assess compliance with the data protection principles without requiring their consent. The Act allows the Secretary of State to extend the assessment notice power to include additional categories of data controllers following a recommendation by the Information Commissioner, consultation with the Commissioner and with the relevant category of data controllers. Such a recommendation could include newspapers, however, an assessment notice would  not permit the Information Commissioner to assess the processing of personal data for one or more of the special purposes.</p>

<a name="10032379000124"></a><b><a name="100323w0003.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="10032379000290"></a>The Secretary of State for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> My department has not undertaken any specific studies on the costs of constructing light rail systems in Great Britain compared with the rest of Europe. However, the National Audit Office in its report titled <I>Improving </I><I>P</I><I>ublic </I><I>T</I><I>ransport in England through Light Rail</I> published in April 2004 did consider European systems against those in operation in England.</p>

<a name="100323w0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_88"></a><a name="10032379000125"></a>There are crucial differences in urban geography which make light rail ideally suited to some French and German cities. Trams are most cost-effective in corridors of very heavy passenger demand. These can support frequent services and closely spaced stops, and generate high patronage per route kilometre. Broad avenues leading to French/German city centres make it relatively easy to accommodate street-running trams without conflict with motor traffic whilst narrower city centre streets have often been pedestrianised. Both these sorts of conditions are relatively rare in English cities. In addition population density in catchment areas of our existing tram systems tends to be much lower than in continental cities, with less frequent services and stops.</p>

<a name="100323w0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_89"></a><a name="10032379000126"></a>Any proposed light rail transit system that is seeking funding from the Department for Transport is assessed using the new approach to appraisal (NATA) process. The NATA process ensures that all impacts are considered when taking a decision about whether to fund a particular system. This includes an assessment of the impact on all transport users including light rail passengers. The NATA process uses the same approach to assessing benefits across all modes of transport.</p>

<a name="100323w0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_90"></a><a name="10032379000127"></a>With regards to utility services, utility companies, along with a number of other organisations, have a statutory right to place apparatus in the highway to enable them to fulfil a statutory duty, for instance the supply of energy or water. If a highway, bridge or transport authority is intending to carry out works in the highway that will affect apparatus, then it is only fair that the cost of moving that apparatus should be met by the organisation that requires the apparatus to be moved.</p>

<a name="100323w0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_127"></a><a name="10032379000173"></a>The Assembly's National Transport Plan, published in July 2009, set out the detail of how the Wales Transport Strategy will be delivered over the next five years. This includes plans for an integrated transport system in Wales, in particular setting out solutions to transport issues along the main movement corridors in Wales including the north/south corridor.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_128"></a><a name="10032379000174"></a>On north/south road links, these include the trunk road programme, with improvements to the A470, the A487 and the A483, and the completion of the Ceredigion link road. The Assembly Government are also examining opportunities for using two-plus-one lanes and passing lanes to improve north-south journey times, reliability and safety for cars, public transport, walkers and cyclists.</p>

<a name="100323w0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_129"></a><a name="10032379000175"></a>On north/south rail links the plan outlines a programme of continued improvements including enhancing the capacity of the section of rail between Shrewsbury and Chester via Wrexham, enabling all north-south services to be routed through Wrexham. The aim is to increase dramatically the proportion of journeys that are made by public transport by improving rail travel and the TrawsCambria bus network. Over time, we should see a better service, covering more communities, in greater comfort.</p>
