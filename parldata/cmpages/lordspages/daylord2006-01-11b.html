<a name="60111-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Criminal Injuries Compensation</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What proportion of awards in criminal injuries compensation in the last financial year were directed to claimants in categories of compensation which are to be abolished.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </b>  My Lords, in our Green Paper issued in December, <i>Rebuilding Lives&#151;supporting victims of crime</i>, we proposed refocusing the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme around seriousness, with more seriously injured victims getting more money and less seriously injured victims getting better support services rather than financial compensation. The paper has invited views on this concept and on how this idea of seriousness might be defined. Decisions about the scheme will be shaped by answers to the consultation, which runs until 1 March this year.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for his reply. Is he aware that in 1996&#150;97 the then government budgeted for the payment of compensation to the victims of crime in the sum of &#163;230 million&#151;the equivalent of &#163;265 million today&#151;but we were told by the noble Baroness Lady Scotland in November 2004 that the current budget was only &#163;163 million, a cut of about &#163;100 million? We have not been given an answer to my Question regarding the percentage of claimants who are to be excluded. How does the noble and learned Lord reconcile such savage cuts in compensation with the blather that we have to put up with from this Government that the victim is being placed always at the centre of the criminal justice system?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   Well really, my Lords. If the noble Lord would read the Green Paper, which I am sure he has, he would see all of the things that we have already done for victims&#151;the witness care units and the new provisions that are being made now. There is less chance of being a victim of crime today than in 1981&#151;the lowest for 25 years. As to the figures, the compensation scheme provided in this country for criminal injuries, on the most recent assessment, provided more than all other EU countries put together.
</p>

<a name="60111-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The noble Lord will understand why I was not able to answer his Question, because this paper is looking at which of the bands should become those where <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_156"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

people do not receive financial compensation, which they often receive a year after the event, but receive practical support instead. So I entirely reject the way that the noble Lord put his supplementary question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Wilcox: </b>   My Lords, I have read that wonderful document from cover to cover and we are very keen to encourage the noble and learned Lord in that endeavour, so my question is definitely for information. What consideration has the Minister given to the establishment of a separate compensation scheme to assist the victims of terrorist attacks perpetrated either in the United Kingdom or abroad?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, not only for reading the paper, but for what she said in support. We are looking at how that issue can be dealt with. It emerged as a result of the events that we have sadly seen throughout the world. So we are looking both at ways of raising public awareness of insurance to deal with some of the immediate consequences of terrorist attacks and the option of setting up a national disaster charitable fund to provide immediate help to victims. These are complicated issues and the Government will make an announcement on them in due course.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Soley: </b>   My Lords, does my noble and learned friend agree that, as he indicated, this is probably one of the best schemes in the world and we should all be very proud of it? But the problem has always been that if the scheme is spread too widely, those who are most in need, often from dreadful injuries, do not get sufficient help. That is really what we should be addressing in the consultation, which I am glad to hear will be going on until March.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right. We want to look at removing, or at least raising, the cap, which at the moment prevents those with the most serious injuries getting the most compensation. But we also need to look at the lower ranges. Something like over 50 per cent of the awards are in the &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,000 range. We have done a survey to look at what people spend the money on. Very little of it is spent, for example, on the things that would deal directly with the effects of crime, such as cosmetic treatment or surgery or something of that sort, and that is partly because the compensation is paid very late. That is why we want to look at whether it makes more sense to provide immediate practical support to those victims and free up some cash for the most seriously injured.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord give some consideration to the fact that compensation may be far too little in the event that victims who may need lifelong care may live far longer than expected or that it may be far too much if, sadly, they live for only a short time, in which case their families will inherit money for no good reason? Can we not give consideration to making the award in terms of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_157"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

an annual sum, which would be available to the victim for life and for life only? That would seem to deal with both those problems.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes a valuable and important point and it is one that we should be looking at in the context of the response to the Green Paper.

<a name="60111-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What efforts they are making to promote freedom of worship abroad.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, we continue to condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. We urge all states to pursue laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect and protect religious minorities from discrimination. I refer the House and my noble friend to the 2005 annual report on human rights, which highlights much of the work that we have done in this area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Anderson of Swansea: </b>   My Lords, your Lordships will be aware of the increasing threats to freedom of worship, even in friendly countries on the Indian sub-continent. In several states of India, for example, there are anti-conversion laws, and Sri Lanka is considering similar legislation. The blasphemy laws in Pakistan are causing great anxiety, and in Bangladesh there are strong pressures for Sharia law. Has my noble friend made representations to those countries? Given this background, why has the Foreign and Commonwealth Office not convened the Religious Freedom Panel, which allows non-governmental organisations to make representations to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office? The panel has not met for more than two years. When will it be convened?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I start by referring to the panel. It is perfectly true to say that it has not met for some time, principally because our focus in the FCO has been on the work of the EU presidency. But we have worked with the faith groups which are represented and with interested NGOs on religious freedom issues. I can say that we intend to fix a date for a further meeting of the panel within the next few months and we will be in touch shortly with panel members.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_158"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 158</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>We have been in touch with all the countries mentioned by my noble friend. We do not believe that the anti-conversion legislation in Sri Lanka is acceptable, and we make bilateral and multilateral representations. In India, although no specific cases of abuse have been raised with us, we are following the matter closely. In Pakistan, we are concerned at the discrimination faced by religious minorities and are actively engaged with the Government of Pakistan on the repeal or modification of its blasphemy laws. As I said in my initial response, we will pursue the issues of tolerance and religious freedom assiduously.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60111-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, with so many instances of denial of religious freedom in many ways, what strong action are the Government taking to ensure that every member state of the United Nations that signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 accepts all that that declaration means? Article 18 says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, most of our efforts consist of trying to work bilaterally with governments where we believe that there is a problem. On the wider international stage, along with our EU partners, we co-sponsored at the UN in November of last year a resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. It was adopted without a vote. I shall not quote extensively from that document, but it shows precisely the values that I know are dear to the heart of this House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that we are privileged to be members of the Commonwealth? The Minister named various countries, and quite a number are members of the Commonwealth. Surely we should be using that organisation to this effect?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, that is quite right, and indeed we do. Discussions in the run-up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in the latter part of last year showed conclusively that Don McKinnon, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, and those working most closely with him are attentive to these issues. The Commonwealth is a source of influence, and one which we must certainly pursue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew3"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Exeter: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the government of Qatar has recently donated land to enable the first Christian Church centre to be built in that area since the seventh century? Will he join me in congratulating those who are involved in such ventures, and comment on government policy on recognising, welcoming and supporting such initiatives in sensitive areas of the world?
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I completely agree with the right reverend Prelate. Our links with Qatar have indicated just how warmly we welcome that development. Generally speaking, aside from saying to people on occasions&#151;as we must&#151;that we find legislation and practices unacceptable in the light of our demand for religious tolerance, we must also be fulsome and open when people are acting in a way which we would welcome.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Sharples: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord said in response to the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Swansea, that the panel has not met because of the UK holding the EU presidency, which was only six months. However, the panel has not met for two years.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I did say that. I said that that was our priority over the recent period. That is the case. It is and has been our priority, but we have stayed in very close contact with the 60 groups that comprise that body. There is a good argument to say that it would have been better had it met earlier. I intend to ensure that it meets as fast as it can.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there are wide variations within the Muslim world as to whether minority religions can establish new places of worship? Will the Government continue to press for more openness where there are current bans or restrictions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, we will continue to press for precisely those outcomes. We are prepared to argue that whether it is hostility to Christianity, Islamophobia or anti-Semitism makes no difference. It is a universal right that people should be able to pursue their religion with dignity and freedom, and we will argue that whatever the circumstances, whatever the faith, whatever the country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister pay particular attention to the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Blackburn, about the Commonwealth? It is a 54-nation grouping stretching across continents and many faiths. There are 500 million Muslims within the Commonwealth, which is potentially a good instrument for promoting religious tolerance. Will he put it rather higher up the list in the catalogue of Foreign Office priorities to build on the Commonwealth membership as a valuable asset in promoting tolerance, stability and peace in the world?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree with that. I do not know whether we could put it higher up, because it has not dropped down the list to any extent. The work that we have done with the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth and its institutions has been precisely to the ends that the noble Lord has illustrated. The Commonwealth is an extraordinary club. It probably could not be invented in the modern world. It is a great historical accident that we have it, but we must make the fullest use of its virtues.

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="60111-02_time0"></a><h5>2.50 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Barnett </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What consideration they have given to proposals for the amendment of the Bank of England Act 1998.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, among other matters, the Bank of England Act 1998 provides the bank with the power to set interest rates, which, as I said to this House on 8 November, has been spectacularly successful in helping to guide the UK economy. The Government are content with the Act and, for that reason, have no intention to amend it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Nobody could disagree with the fact that the Monetary Policy Committee has usually been successful in meeting the target for inflation. On the other hand, I am sure he is aware that under Section 11 of the Act, which contains the three small words &quot;subject to that&quot;&#151;that is, getting the inflation rate right&#151;it is supposed to take account of the Government&#039;s economic policy. It seems to have totally disregarded that section of the Act. If the Minister is not prepared to do anything about the Act, will he at least emphasise, publicly, that it is the intention of the Government that the Monetary Policy Committee should abide by that aspect of the Act too? There will be a meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee tomorrow. I am sure that it will be waiting urgently to hear what my noble friend has to say about interest rates after tomorrow&#039;s debate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, it is not for the Government to opine on what interest rate levels should be. The purpose of the independence of the Bank of England is that the Monetary Policy Committee should set them. The noble Lord was right to say that the remit of the policy committee is to deliver price stability, but without prejudice to that objective, to support the Government&#039;s economic policy, including their objectives for growth and employment. The committee has done that. That is manifested in the fact that our economy has continued to grow. There have been 34 successive quarters of growth under this Labour Government and employment is at its highest level ever.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Lawson of Blaby: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the Minister on his robust rejection of the siren appeal of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. Is he aware&#151;I am sure that he is&#151;that any attempt to set other objectives for the Bank of England and to attach more importance to them would water down, in the eyes of the financial markets, the commitment to maintaining price stability, thereby making its task considerably more difficult?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the thrust of that question. Price stability is a precondition for high and stable levels of growth and employment, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_161"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which in turn will help to create the conditions for price stability on a sustainable basis. That is the pre-eminent requirement of the Monetary Policy Committee and it has been delivered. It would be wrong to undermine that credibility, which has been hard won. It is important that we do not do that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, notwithstanding the late conversion of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, to the independence of the Bank of England, does the Minister accept that whether central banks should be concerned solely with price stability and inflation or whether they should also take into account other economic considerations is a real issue. Does he also accept that the Bank of England, since 1997, has probably been a beacon of achievement here when compared with the European Central Bank?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I certainly agree with that latter point. That has been acknowledged by the OECD and others. However, I stress that the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank of England have to take into account a number of factors, but price stability is the key. In that regard, the remit of the Bank of England is not dissimilar to that of the European Central Bank.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60111-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister take this opportunity to offer some comment on reports which have appeared today suggesting that the Bank of England is so concerned about the reliability of government statistics that it is now setting up its own unit to obtain material on which it can rely?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60111-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, prior to the Pre-Budget Report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Office for National Statistics is to be given independence. Legislation to that effect will come forward during the course of this year. That has been widely welcomed and it is the right thing to do. However, it is wrong perpetually to seek to undermine the opinions of the Office for National Statistics. It serves the country and the economy well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that monetary policy is enhanced by a robust and independent Governor of the Bank of England, one, for example, who is prepared to speak his mind on the Chancellor&#039;s fiddling around with the golden rule? Will he therefore agree that the Bank of England Act would be better if the appointment and, importantly, the reappointment of the Governor were in the hands not of the Government, but of an independent body?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the appointment of the Governor is a Crown appointment undertaken on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I believe that that has served the system well to date. I reject any assertion that there has been fiddling with the figures. It is important that the Governor of the Bank of England <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_162"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 162</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is able to express robust views. This one certainly has. That is part of the independence and credibility of the system that we have.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Harrison: </b>   My Lords, is it not the case that not only the statutes of the European Central Bank but also the statutes of the American Fed state that once price stability has been taken into account, other policies should be supported, in the case of the American Fed, for instance, to reduce unemployment? Surely, the case being made by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is that once price stability has been maintained, it is open to the MPC to aid and abet government policies in these other areas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, it is right that the Federal Reserve has a slightly wider remit than the Bank of England or the ECB, but I stress that, by its focus on price stability, the bank is supporting the other key components of government policy. That is manifest in what has happened in the success of the economy, in growth and in employment levels. The Bank of England is doing its job in this regard and no adjustment to the Act is necessary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend ignore the always dangerous support of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, and recognise that what I was suggesting in no way undermines the Act? The Act specifically states, &quot;subject to that&quot;&#151;namely, getting the rate of inflation right&#151;it should consider the Government&#039;s economic policy. Will my noble friend emphasise that that is the case?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to emphasise that that is what the Act states. There is no suggestion that the Bank of England is not aware of that or has not had regard to it in the conduct of its operations.

<a name="60111-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I am very, very grateful to the wise and learned noble Lord, but I did not detect a question, unfortunately.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew11"></a><b> Earl Ferrers: </b>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware of the pleasure that his Answer will give? I refer not just to the Answer itself but to the fact that there appears to be at least one area of government that the Government are not prepared to screw up, particularly in relation to the constitution.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, I was aware of the pleasure that my Answer would give in certain quarters, although it is rather unfair of the noble Earl to refer to the other constitutional changes we have made as &quot;screwing up&quot; certain arrangements. I hope that as time goes on the merit of what we have done will become apparent.

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   My Lords, I detect a slight hint in my noble and learned friend&#039;s Answer that, if there were marches down Whitehall saying &quot;end gender discrimination&quot; as regards the monarchy, the Government might be persuaded to change their mind. I put a serious point to him: he has said that the heir to the throne is male and that his son is male; yes, but it would be invidious to consider legislation when Prince William is married and has children. Doing so then would be too late.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   My Lords, as I say, there is no groundswell for change at the moment. We abhor gender discrimination. Let us not hypothesise about what may happen in the future.

<a name="column_164"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government why a document from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights which commented on the Terrorism Bill and which the high commissioner requested be laid before the House before Second Reading of the Terrorism Bill was withheld from the House by the Home Office during the Second Reading and Committee stage of the Bill.
</p></ul>



<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, the Government could not have published the UN commissioner&#039;s letter prior to Second Reading of the Terrorism Bill, as she requested, since she did not submit it to us until a week after Second Reading had taken place. We have published the letter under cover of a Written Ministerial Statement in time for it to be considered while the Terrorism Bill is still before your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   My Lords, in my haste to table the PNQ this morning before the deadline, I overlooked the fact that the letter was received shortly after Second Reading. The letter refers specifically to Second Reading and Committee. I note the disturbing response of noble Lords on the Benches opposite. I am asking the Government to comment on their behaviour. The noble Baroness has omitted to give a full explanation. The letter concerned a matter of the greatest public interest, it came from a source of the highest significance and it contained a specific request that it be directed to the attention of this House. Awareness of this letter would certainly have affected the way in which this House considered the Bill in Committee, by which time the Government had the letter. Will the Minister give an assurance that the Government will give positive consideration to relaxing the rules relating to Report, to enable the House to probe properly the points raised by the United Nations commissioner?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60111-03_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to say that it will not be necessary so to do because, as the noble Baroness will see, having had the advantage of reading that letter, all the issues raised by the commissioner have been raised by Members of this House, who have the acuity to raise them themselves. Those issues were raised both in the other place and here, and have been raised fully.

<a name="60111-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, the stamp on the letter indicates that it was deposited in the House of Lords Library in 2006, after the beginning of the new year. It is document number 003. I presume that it was deposited at the very beginning of this year. No notice was given, either to my noble friend Lord Goodhart or to myself, of the contents of the letter, which has come to light simply by the assiduity of the noble Baroness who has raised this Question. Why were we not given direct notice of this letter, even if it had been received after Second Reading had taken place?
</p>

both given official notice of this letter by way of Written Ministerial Statement on Monday of this week. We deposited it in the Library and we gave a response to that letter. I understand that it had been intended that the Written Ministerial Answer would be given before we broke. As a result of the illness of an official, it did not arrive until Monday, but, the matter came before the House as soon as was reasonably practicable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   My Lords, it appears from the Minister&#039;s replies that the letter was germane to matters considered in Committee, that it was in the possession of the Government before the Committee met and that the letter was not made available to the Opposition or other noble Lords until after Committee. Is that the situation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the situation is that the letter was initially received by the Foreign Office. It was then transferred to the Home Office. We were already in Committee on the 5th. We debated the issue in relation to Clauses 1 and 2 on 5 and 6 December. At the time, I was not appraised of the contents of that letter, but all the issues raised by the UN commissioner were raised by Members of the House: issues of intent; issues relating to Clause 1&#151;
</p>

<a name="60111-04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>I hear noble Lords from a sedentary position saying, discourteously, &quot;Rubbish&quot;. I assure the House that what I tell the House is an accurate representation of what happened.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend repeat the dates that she gave in her reply? Is it not the case that the letter did not arrive until a week after Second Reading and that it was at Second Reading that the commissioner asked our attention to be drawn to it? Is it not also the case that in Committee there were no Divisions, so no irrevocable decisions have been taken, and that decisions can be made on Report? Is it not a fact that it was almost admitted&#151;or, rather, it ought to have been admitted&#151;by the noble Baroness that, far from the noble Baroness calling the Government to account on the matter and far from her misleading the House or deserving any criticism, she should receive an apology?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the facts given by my noble friend are accurate. Of course, it is a matter for the noble Baroness whether she wishes to apologise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that the views of the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Madame Arbour, are extremely relevant to the issues that we were debating and that it would have been a considerable support to us had we been able to raise those issues during debate in Committee? Does she accept that it is plainly wrong <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_166"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 166</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for the Government to have failed to make the letter available before we started Committee on 5 December?
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I have made it clear that the Government have taken proper steps to make the letter available. It was not made available before we started at Second Reading, which is the request that was made. Your Lordships will remember that on the very first day in Committee, I made it clear, in responding to the issue of intent, that we were minded to table other amendments. Indeed, throughout the debate, I continued to assure the Committee that we were continuing to listen and that further amendments would be laid. They will be laid either today or tomorrow.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, while entirely accepting that the Minister had no knowledge of this, is that not somewhat worrying? In my day as a Minister, the Bill team would have picked up a letter of this kind and a draft would have come to the Minister to write to Front Benchers informing them of what had happened. The fact that it took until the New Year to put the letter in the Library and to answer a Question suggests that there is at least something awry in the organisation of the Minister&#039;s department.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the Bill team with whom I have had the privilege to work have been assiduous in their work. If there has been some misconnection, I do not say that it is as a result of a lack of diligence on their part. I hope that throughout the way that we have managed the Terrorism Bill and the other Bill, Members opposite have been given the greatest degree of facilitation and response from us on the detail.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, just to put the record straight on the accusation of the noble Baroness that my noble friend and I said, &quot;Rubbish!&quot;, we did not. My noble friend said, &quot;So what?&quot; and I said that it was grubby. The more that I hear of this debate, the grubbier I think it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I await the noble Lord&#039;s question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, I raise no epithet. Would the Minister consider that, on a Bill of this extreme importance, where the relationship between the United Kingdom Government and the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights is central to many of the Government&#039;s own principles, at the very least an explanation should be forthcoming? The Minister&#039;s explanation involved the illness of an official, but it should have been possible to warn the Front Benches of the existence of the letter and then make provisions to amend our handling of the Report stage in the way suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Baroness says in relation to that. I agree that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_167"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 167</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

it is of the utmost importance that we should have opportunities to consider this. But I do not feel that we have in any way been disadvantaged. The issues that were of importance&#151;and those who have read the letter will see that what I say is accurate&#151;have been very well canvassed in all our debates. Indeed, during the debates we indicated that we were minded&#151;and we will be minded&#151;to bring forward amendments. I have indicated already that we hope to be able to do that by the end of today or tomorrow. This will give plenty of time before Report for further consideration and plenty of time for those who wish to pray in aid the UN commissioner if they feel that further or other support&#151;other than the rhetoric of noble Lords&#151;is necessary.

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60111-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Lord Rooker): </b> 
<a name="60111-04_state0"></a> My Lords, with permission, I will repeat a Statement made in the other place by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;Northern Ireland is governed best when governed locally. Since 2002, for reasons the whole House is aware of, that has not been possible. But our commitment remains absolutely clear: this Government believe that 2006 can be the year for the restoration of the Assembly and will work to that end as a matter of the utmost priority.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;My predecessors have all referred to critical times for Northern Ireland. And there have been many. But this year is indeed a critical one, and especially for Northern Ireland&#039;s political parties, and specifically Assembly Members: 2006 is a make or break year for them.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;If there is no restoration of the Assembly in prospect, then two stark realities have to be faced. First, public resentment within Northern Ireland continues to build at the continued payment of Assembly Members&#039; salaries and allowances totalling on average &#163;85,000 per Member while Stormont stands idle. Since it was suspended in October 2002, the Assembly has cost &#163;78 million to maintain.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_168"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 168</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="60111-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;Countless times voters in Northern Ireland have asked me: how long can this go on? I want to tell the House today: not many months more. Secondly, no Northern Ireland political leader has disagreed with me that it would be traducing democracy to have elections&#151;for a second time&#151;to an Assembly that does not exist.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;Elections are due in May 2007. For those to be meaningful we must have an Assembly exercising its full responsibilities. We therefore need to make progress urgently. We cannot let things drift.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;Members of the Legislative Assembly were elected to be active members of a legislative assembly, working for their constituents in that Assembly. They have a duty to do so.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;I want to see them discharging their responsibilities to their electors to govern on the shared basis the voters of Northern Ireland gave a mandate for in the 1998 referendum.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;Of course this means building greater trust to deliver on commitments already made on all sides. Unionists and nationalists need to know that republicans are committed to exclusively lawful means. They need to know that all paramilitary activity, including criminality, has ended. The Independent Monitoring Commission is the body that will make an assessment. They also need to know that there is unequivocal support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the rule of law. And republicans and nationalists have to know that unionists are fully committed to fair and equitable power sharing.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;But if people are serious about seeing a shared future based on fairness and equality, they must persuade each other of that.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;I am therefore asking each of the political parties to agree dates for substantial discussions in early February with the British and Irish Governments to give their views on the way forward to restore the political institutions.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;The Prime Minister, together with the Taoiseach, will be closely involved with developments during the year.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;I also wish to inform the House about the Government&#039;s intentions as regards the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;When I moved the Second Reading on 23 November, I said that it was necessary to help bring about closure to Northern Ireland&#039;s dark past of violence by resolving outstanding issues that had not been dealt with in the Belfast agreement, primarily that of terrorist suspects &#039;on the run&#039;. Following the agreement, over 400 paramilitary prisoners were released on licence.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;Although victims of atrocities were, understandably, in uproar at the sight of murderers and former terrorists walking free, it was the right thing to do to seal the agreement and lock in the peace.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_169"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 169</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="60111-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;But it left unresolved an equally difficult matter: the issue of what to do about those who had committed terrorist offences before 10 April 1998 and who, had they been in prison at the material time, would have been part of the Early Release Scheme. And it also left the question of what to do about others who might be prosecuted in future for crimes committed during the troubles before the Good Friday agreement.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;The Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill is a challenge to everyone to look to the future, not to be trapped in the past and that challenge remains.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;But, as I told the House then, I did not bring forward this legislation with a spring in my step because I knew how hard it was for those thousands of victims who had lost so much.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_22"></a>&quot;I knew that introducing this legislation would be difficult and uncomfortable: I neither sought nor expected the sympathy of the House for that.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para25"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_23"></a>&quot;Members of the House, particularly those from Northern Ireland, expressed their opposition to this Bill with great power and passion. In detailed discussion in Committee over many hours, those concerns were amplified with real commitment by Members across the Committee.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para26"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_24"></a>&quot;That passion was expressed no less powerfully outside the House in meetings that I and the honourable Member for Delyn had with victims groups.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para27"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_25"></a>&quot;In response to the arguments put to us in Committee, we have been drafting wide-ranging amendments to the Bill&#151;including ensuring that defendants would have to appear before the Special Tribunal. And we were giving serious consideration to a time limit for the scheme.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para28"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_26"></a>&quot;The Government still feel that it was right to introduce this legislation, not least to honour the commitment made publicly by both the British and Irish Governments in 2003, a commitment that was a key building block in the process which saw the IRA end their armed campaign.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para29"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_27"></a>&quot;The Government could have proceeded with this Bill when the issue was first raised seven years ago. We could have done so when the Joint Declaration was made in 2003. But we did not because the IRA had not delivered on its promise to end its war. We waited until that happened.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para30"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_28"></a>&quot;Every Northern Ireland party vigorously opposed the Bill&#151;bar Sinn Fein. Now Sinn Fein is opposed because it refuses to accept that this legislation should apply to members of the security forces charged with terrorism-related offences.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para31"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_29"></a>&quot;To exclude any members of the security forces who might have been involved in such offences from the provisions of the Bill would not only have been illogical, it would have been indefensible and we would not do it. Closure on the past cannot be one-sided. That was, is, and remains, non-negotiable. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_170"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 170</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The process would have made people accountable for their past actions through the Special Tribunal before being released on licence.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para32"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_30"></a>&quot;Sinn Fein has now said that any republican potentially covered by the legislation should have nothing to do with it. But if nobody goes through the process, victims, who would have suffered the pain of having to come to terms with this legislation, would have had done so for nothing. That is unacceptable, and I am therefore withdrawing the Bill.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para33"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_31"></a>&quot;When I introduced this Bill I said that I would not presume to tell any victim that they must draw a line under the past. But the Government remain of the view that this anomaly will need at some stage to be faced as part of the process of moving forward. It is regrettable that Northern Ireland is not yet ready to do so.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para34"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_32"></a>&quot;We will reflect carefully over the coming months on how to move forward on this issue in the context of dealing with the legacy of the past. We will not rush to conclusions. I will take stock in the autumn.


</p>

<a name="60111-04_para35"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_33"></a>&quot;In reflecting, we will be mindful of the views of all the political parties, the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs, victims&#039; groups and others. We are coming to the endgame of a long period of transition that began with the ceasefires of the early 1990s. As I have said before, the endgame in conflict transformation is often the hardest part, as it has proved in this case. But 2006 can and must be a year of historic progress in Northern Ireland. It must be a year in which we will see a devolved, power-sharing executive of local politicians taking the decisions that affect the everyday lives of the people of Northern Ireland. That goal should unite all Members of this House&quot;.

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The issues that the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill sought to address still need resolving, as the Secretary of State has said. Does the noble Lord accept, on behalf of the Secretary of State, that one of the most serious criticisms of this Bill is the lack of sensitivity towards the victims and their families? Will the noble Lord assure the House that, when Her Majesty&#039;s Government return to this issue in the future, the interests of victims will be paramount?
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The third issue is that full support for the PSNI and the criminal justice processes from all parties is absolutely vital.

<a name="60111-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Reflecting forward, we have consistently supported devolution. We support the Secretary of State&#039;s desire to see all institutions up and running before the 2007 elections. We do not wish to continue governing Northern Ireland by statutory instruments from your Lordships&#039; House and the other place which, to all of us, is foreign and we feel that we are unable to fulfil the true democratic role. However, as per the Good Friday agreement, we must be certain that the commitment to peaceful and democratic means is permanent and irreversible before the final endgame, referred to by the Secretary of State, can be played.

<a name="60111-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. We welcome both parts of the Statement: the first, slightly less important but nevertheless significant part concerns the continuing payment of the Members of the Assembly. Since the Assembly was suspended in 2002, your Lordships will know that I have regularly raised the question of continuing to pay salaries to MLAs. The Government were very reluctant to contemplate that, even arguing that they were still carrying out constituency duties and, even more questionable, that there was a need to sustain a political elite. Later, there was a token deduction and Mr Paul Murphy, the then Secretary of State, muttered about the problem of payment, which was echoed by the Prime Minister.
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>I very much hope that the Statement today means that there will be no more prevarication or procrastination, no more huffing and puffing. If the devolved institutions are not up and running soon, MLA salaries should be stopped. That is explicit in the Statement, although it is too vague in saying that payment should continue for &quot;not many more months&quot;. That is far too imprecise. Does the Minister agree that it would be better to set a specific date, say 31 May, after which remuneration will cease? Later than that, the marching season will be looming and that is always used as an excuse for a delay. Will the Government consider a specific date?
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>As I remarked the last time that MLA payment was raised in your Lordships&#039; House, the prospect of its withdrawal may well be a spur to interparty agreement to collaborate. The fear of such loss is one of the many <br>&nbsp;<br>

things that unites Northern Ireland political parties across the community divide. We all wish for a quick restoration of the devolutionary settlement.
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>We on these Benches&#151;and I would guess, the whole House&#151;are mightily relieved that the Secretary of State has decided to withdraw the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill. It was welcomed by none. It solved nothing and antagonised most public opinion for one reason or another across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland. The idea that a superannuated judge should preside over some sort of process, in which alleged suspects, or those actually charged but on the run, or those convicted but who had escaped, who did not even have to appear before him or her, was a parody. It was an attempt to put some kind of figleaf legitimacy on what for all intents and purposes was a pardon by executive action. Such a notion was doomed to failure from the very start, but it could form the basis of a modern-day Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. We are pleased that the Government have withdrawn the Bill and congratulate them on bowing to the inevitable.
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>In conclusion, I have two other questions for the Minister. Will he undertake that, in any future discussions on solving the problem of &quot;on the runs&quot;, both Governments will have all-inclusive talks with all the Northern Ireland political parties and not just do a side deal with Sinn Fein? This matter will only be resolved by an open &quot;treaty&quot; openly arrived that.
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Secondly, will the Secretary of State consider that a fundamental part of moving Northern Ireland forwards is the shared future agenda? Last February, the then Secretary of State made a commitment to the other place to publish the first of the triennial action plans for a shared future in the autumn of 2005. When can we expect the plan to be published? Why are the Government failing to make improved community relations a priority?

There is not much more that I can say in addition to the Statement. Let us be clear: the Bill is dead. It will not be coming back. That does not mean that the issue goes away, which was recognised in both comments. This issue will have to be dealt with at some point in a legislative form. It is not something that can be done behind closed doors or by executive action, but the Bill is effectively dead.

<a name="60111-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>On the issue of victims&#039; needs being paramount, as the Secretary of State said in the Statement, we knew that this would cause great upset to the victims and they made that abundantly clear, both to the Secretary of State and other Ministers. Therefore, we want to give careful thought to the issue. There is no deadline. The Secretary of State said that he would take stock in the autumn. Although there is no deadline, the issue will not go away and we want to make that absolutely clear. There needs to be a wider consensus and there must be a rebuilding of trust, which is implicit in the Statement, from both sides of the community.

<a name="60111-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>There must also be the acceptance by Assembly Members and putative Ministers of support for the police and the rule of law. This is a black-and-white issue: if you do not support the police and the rule of law, you are actually supporting criminals, rapists, muggers, thieves and embezzlers&#151;that is the implication. You cannot expect to be in Government in that situation, so that is implicit. There are other parts of the process to be carried through, and we understand that there are further devolutionary moves ahead. We want to make it absolutely clear that there is no walking back from them.
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, there are no dates. To be honest, it would not have been helpful if the Secretary of State or the Government had said today that we will need to get an agreement, or that MLAs will lose their salaries, or that we will need the Assembly up and running, all by a certain date. We have made it clear about 2006; we have also made it clear&#151;I think the consensus among all the party leaders is&#151;that the elections that would normally take place in 2007 will not take place if the Assembly is not up and running in 2006. There must be a process for stopping those elections and that, as has been made clear, cannot be left until the last minute. So putting in a date of any kind at present would not act as a spur; in fact, it could have almost the opposite effect.
</p>

<a name="60111-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The issue of the on-the-runs is, as I have said, one that we will have to think about and take stock of in the autumn. It is not a question of having no discussions, but there cannot be any side deals. The deal which was already done was reneged on by the one political party that had asked for the legislation. It wanted it and supported it, but it has reneged on it because it did not like it being double-sided; that is the bottom line here. It wanted one-sided treatment, which we are not prepared to accept. We have made that absolutely clear in the Statement.

<a name="60111-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rogan: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Statement to the House this afternoon, and I also greatly welcome it. Today, the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland have received a late but much welcome Christmas present, with the Government not now proceeding with the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, or the on-the-run legislation. I am delighted that the Minister has at last seen sense and withdrawn that odious Bill, but it is a sad reflection that it took Sinn Fein/IRA to say that the Republicans would have nothing to do with that evil Bill before the Minister would agree to withdraw it.

The Bill came as a surprise to no one; it was foreshadowed in writing in 2003, in public documents. Everybody knew what would happen if and when the IRA finally gave up the war. It was part of a commitment which the Government entered into and fulfilled. There is no consensus on the Bill and, indeed, the prospect of the victims getting nothing out of the Bill was one clincher in its withdrawal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60111-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I was slightly surprised by the frankness of the Secretary of State when he admitted in a radio interview that the Bill had been brought forward as a result of a commitment made to the government of the republic and to IRA/Sinn Fein? Is he aware that I am, if anything, rather more surprised that the Secretary of State has admitted today that it has been vetoed by the IRA? A Government who would not accept the misgivings that were expressed in the other place, and were perhaps fearful of what might happen to the Bill here, have now allowed a terrorist organisation to veto a Bill which the noble Lord himself described as &quot;necessary&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60111-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, obviously heard the interview. I said that the Bill was evil but necessary&#151;I did not call it a necessary evil. I thought &quot;evil but necessary&quot; was a worse condemnation. But the issue will not go away. The Bill was necessary; we have decided it would not suit the purpose in the form it was drafted because it would not be used, but the issue will not go away. I have to disabuse noble Lords of the idea that because the Bill has been withdrawn the issue is put to bed and nothing needs to be done in the future.
</p>

<a name="60111-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, said that he was surprised at the Secretary of State&#039;s frankness. He was frank. Sinn Fein wanted a one-sided arrangement; Sinn Fein was not being offered a one-sided arrangement and it will not be offered a one-sided arrangement. As both I and the Secretary of State said, what Sinn Fein decides about what happens to members of the security forces is not negotiable.

I believe that one of the problems is that this issue was agreed in the margins of Weston Park and eventually entered the public domain. There has been tremendous concern because it was not full frontal, as it were, in the first place. This has been a very serious feature of the issue. Can the Minister be frank and say that nothing else is lurking around the margins of Weston Park that still has to be outed?

The Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill dealt with specific issues about on-the-runs.

A public document was published in 2003 which set out what would happen if a sequence of events occurred&#151;that is, the abandonment of the war by the IRA. I cannot go beyond that, because that is what this issue is about.

It is not as though they are sitting in Stormont twiddling their fingers&#151;they are all doing useful jobs. I occasionally come across people in various of the departments for which we, as direct rule Ministers, are responsible, who indicate that their full-time job is at the Assembly if and when it is up and running.

But we are getting a growing criminality cult, which makes it even more important that the Police Service of Northern Ireland is fully supported.

The language of victory and defeat has got to go, and they must come to the table and be at the table thinking, &quot;We&#039;ve got a piece of success&quot;.

I have listened to interviews with the Chief Constable recently. He did a fairly long radio interview&#151;I believe that it was on the &quot;Today&quot; programme&#151;just before Christmas. Massive progress is being made by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in getting into areas where it would not traditionally have been, where officers have been able to police in a way that traditionally they have not been able to. I heard that they have been on bicycles&#151;although I understand that that can be a problem sometimes even for policing in GB. But I shall seek to get an up-to-date position from the Chief Constable, and I shall make sure that a note is placed in the Library. I cannot dispute the generality of the noble Lord&#039;s remarks without the figures, but I understand from listening to the Chief Constable that the position is not as bad as the noble Lord said.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60111-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   My Lords, so great is the relief at the withdrawal of the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill that it may have been overlooked that the Government have disguised the enormity of their action in withdrawing that odious Bill by somehow implying a denigration of MLAs. The two issues should not have been confused in the Statement. The MLAs are the electorate&#039;s contact with what passes for democracy in Northern Ireland&#151;a great deal more so than those who are in the Northern Ireland Office.
</p>

<a name="60111-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I listened to the Secretary of State respond to questions in another place, and I am more than perplexed by his suggestion that the withdrawal of the Bill leaves members of the security forces vulnerable&#151;that there is now no &quot;off the hook&quot; facility for members of the security forces. As a serving officer for many years, I was circumscribed by rules; if I had ever broken them, I should have been unworthy of my commission and would have expected to be punished. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_177"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 177</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

But I want to know that genuine mistakes made by soldiers and police officers in the heat of a fire fight or contact over more than 20 years from 1970 to 1994 will not be made answerable in the context of the normal circumstances that largely exist today. Can the Minister reassure me on that point?
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60111-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   To be honest, my Lords, that last question gives the game away. This is the whole point. If members of the security forces, without any protection from the kind of plan in this Bill, subject to normal military and legal procedures, were prosecuted for something that happened in the exact circumstances described by the noble Lord, and were found guilty by a court and sent to prison when the terrorists have taken advantage of the situation, think how it would feel. If the noble Lord was listening, the Secretary of State gave this as an example of why we do not want one-sided treatment. That is the whole point of the exercise, and of course it is the sticking point for Sinn Fein.
</p>

<a name="60111-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>I pay tribute to anyone who has served in Northern Ireland, politically or militarily, and nothing I say knocks that, but no one can say the Government are disguising what we are doing, having made a Statement in the House of Commons and in this place as to what our intentions are. I shall deal with the two issues arising from what the noble Lord said. First, we are trying to deal with getting forward on the issue of the on-the-runs, because it will not go away. It certainly will not go away for the security forces, as has been said by the noble Lord, by direct and explicit example.
</p>

<a name="60111-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Secondly, we have to deal with the issue of the institutions in Northern Ireland. I agree that part-time commuting direct-rule Ministers looking after more than one department is at least second best compared to local politicians. The MLAs are elected, but they are not doing anything. They are writing letters to Ministers and going on delegations, but they are not legislating. They are not holding Ministers to account, because we are not going to account to MLAs: we are accountable to this place and to the other place. It is almost pretend politics. We want them to be a fully effective legislative assembly, controlling local politicians who are operating as Ministers, taking decisions on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, and we want that as soon as possible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="60111-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   My Lords, I go back to a remark by the Minister a few minutes ago. He said that Sinn Fein had reneged on the agreement it had with the two governments and from which this Bill derived. Is it the case that from the very beginning it was made clear to Sinn Fein that the Bill would offer the same relief, if that is the right word, to security forces that was offered to the on-the-runs? In the light of the anguish suffered by the victims at the prospect of this Bill, which the Statement speaks of very eloquently, would it not have been a good deal better for all the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60111-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord asks a quite specific and very relevant question, to which, to be honest, I do not know the answer. These decisions and agreements were made probably two, maybe three Secretaries of State ago. Everyone knows about the public document published in 2003; it has been in the Library and in public circulation. The Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill was based upon that. The decision was taken to ensure that there was no one-sided treatment, and therefore the security forces were included. At what point that occurred, I simply do not know.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="60111-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, is there not a danger that the Government will be in a position where they are damned if they do and damned if they don&#039;t? Many of us should be grateful to both the Secretary of State and the Minister for the wisdom they have exercised in making this move today. Is the Minister not right to point us towards the long-term problem that remains? Looking at models elsewhere in the world that have dealt with justice and truth, does he agree that we need to try to create some sort of mechanism where people can own up to the things they have done in the past involving terror, murder, the deaths of thousands of people and the injuries of tens of thousands more&#151;the victims who have been mentioned in your Lordships&#039; House today? On both sides of the divide, with Loyalist groups as well now talking about disengagement from the violent process, we need to put something in place where people can own up to the past, wipe the slate clean and move on into the kind of democratic politics the Minister has outlined.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>

I am much heartened by what he said. It could hardly have been a stronger statement of the need for recognition of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the rule of law. I only hope that now, at last, the Government will stand on this point and not make yet further concessions in their desperate search for an agreement.

<a name="60111-07_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, it is needless to say that I greatly welcome the fact that this Bill is temporarily dead, although I am concerned that the Statement suggests that other ways are still to be found of solving what the Government regard as the problem of the OTRs. What is happening about the victims commissioner who was supposed to be set up as part of this legislation? Does he exist and has he got a budget?
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="60111-07_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the victims commissioner does exist. The appointment was announced towards the end of last year&#151;it was Mrs McDougall, I think. There is not an issue here. The victims commissioner is not dependent on this Bill. This was not a quid pro quo, it was another strand of the changes. The victims commissioner has been appointed and no budget that is set aside for the victims commissioner will be affected by the withdrawal of this Bill. I can give an absolute assurance on that.

<a name="60111-07_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Grocott: </b>   My Lords, before we start the Second Reading, perhaps I may appeal to the self-regulatory spirit of the House by saying that we have two Second Readings which have attracted 37 speakers between them. Obviously, when the Second Readings were scheduled we did not know that there would be either a Statement or a PNQ; nor, frankly, did we know how many people would put their names down to speak on either of the Second Readings. If Back-Bench contributions were around nine minutes on each Bill we would meet our recommended finishing time of 10 o&#039;clock.
</p>

<a name="60111-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I would make a particular appeal on this because the House will recall that the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Bill was scheduled for just before the Christmas break. We withdrew it in the spirit of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="60111-08_time0"></a><h5>3.53 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="60111-08_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>One hundred and fifty years ago, my predecessor Robert Lowe, later First Viscount Sherbrooke, brought forward the Bill that created the joint stock limited liability company. It was the first nationwide codification of company law in the world, and he has recently been described as &quot;the father of modern company law&quot;. Our company law continues to have an excellent record. Since 1997 new incorporations have risen by over 60 per cent and the number of foreign firms incorporating in the UK has more than quadrupled. No doubt this is because, according to the World Bank&#039;s assessment, it is quicker and cheaper for companies to set up in the UK than in any other EU member state.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>We think that improvements can still be made. Companies operate internationally and recent legal judgments make cross-border incorporations easier. Overseas owners hold around a third of the stock in listed UK companies&#151;more than twice the level in 1993. If we want these owners to continue to invest in UK companies, we need them to retain their confidence in our system of corporate governance.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Over the past half century, a number of significant Companies Acts have been introduced by governments from all parts of the political spectrum, often following on from the deliberations of an expert committee. The first post-war legislation&#151;the Companies Act 1947&#151;implemented the Cohen report of 1945 and, among other things, proposed the requirement that a company&#039;s accounts represent a &quot;true and fair view&quot; of the state of affairs of the company.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The Companies Act 1967 introduced, among other things, the requirement for all companies to file accounts with Companies House. Shorter Acts followed: in 1976, dealing with accounts and audit; in 1980, implementing the distinction between public and private companies; and, in 1981, making detailed provisions on the form and content of company accounts and implementing a European directive in this area.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The 750 sections of the consolidating 1985 Act remain of course the centrepiece of our current law. This was followed in 1986 by the Financial Services Act, marking the beginning of a separate branch of legislation for securities, and by the Companies Act 1989, which implemented the EC&#039;s Eighth Company <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_181"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 181</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Law Directive on group accounts and the EC&#039;s Eighth Company Law Directive on the qualifications of auditors.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>I hope that that short and partial review of the past makes clear the need constantly to update our company law in response to changes in the way that companies do business and how that is often best done, as in this Bill, based on a previous review by independent experts and taken forward largely on a cross-party basis. I hope that we can, as far as possible, continue that tradition. That said, I do not think that the Bill is merely &quot;business as usual&quot;. In its clear focus on simplification, on the needs of small businesses, which are so important to our economy, and on deregulation, I believe it represents a break with the past.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The Bill has been drawn up in a unique partnership with business. In 1998, we commissioned the <i>Company Law Review</i>&#151;an independent group of experts, practitioners and business people&#151;to take a fundamental look at our system of company law. The review conducted a thorough and authoritative assessment of the changes that need to be made and is the essential blueprint for the reforms we now propose.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The review was followed by two White Papers, in 2002 and 2005, and by further consultation on specific proposals. The Bill includes significant deregulatory change and, based on the information we have had from stakeholders, we estimate that it will produce savings for business of around &#163;250 million a year, of which &#163;100 million a year will benefit small business. That includes: significant savings relating to moves away from paper communications towards electronic communications, which could be close to &#163;50 million per year for FTSE-listed companies alone; benefits for many companies, particularly smaller private ones, of simplifications to the way they take their decisions, including, for example, removing the requirement for them to hold annual general meetings and a move towards greater use of written resolutions with savings perhaps in the range of &#163;25 million to &#163;100 million a year; greater clarification provided by the Bill on directors&#039; duties; and the general savings to companies, their advisers and all users of the law from redrafting it and providing a clearer structure and language.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>It is also important to emphasise the less easily quantifiable, but no less real, economic benefits which we believe could arise for all companies and for the economy as a whole from the enhancements to corporate governance, shareholder engagement and the modernisation of decision-making processes that the Bill introduces.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The Bill repeals about two-thirds of the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989, including all the provisions most frequently used by small companies. The legislation has been reordered and redrafted in clearer language to make it much easier for companies of whatever size to understand the requirements on them. I hope that noble Lords will be able to join me in complimenting <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_182"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

parliamentary counsel on the clarity of the drafting, which has been favourably commented on by a number of those whom we have consulted.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Noble Lords may ask why the Bill is not a complete consolidation of existing company law. That is largely a case of reflecting the views of those whom we consulted. They told us that they wanted to see restatement of the areas which were of day-to-day relevance but not to see provisions reworked for the sake of it.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>On capital maintenance, for example, which is a large chunk of what remains in the 1985 Act, we are pressing for fundamental reform in the EU. To restate in advance of that would not be helpful for users, although the Bill does make some useful specific changes. In practice, we are told that, when referring to company law, users use publications such as <i>Butterworths</i>, which shows the Acts as amended and includes relevant statutory instruments and, indeed, financial services legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60111-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, as the Minister knows, I am in favour of some degree of consolidation at this stage. However, the logic of what he says is that we will have to wait for a very long time before consolidation can take effect. For that reason, would he reconsider consolidation now? It is always possible to come back later with further measures.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="60111-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, as I was saying, this is not what we have been asked to, and not what business and lawyers want us to do. In any case, if we were to consolidate all company law, we would shortly be faced with a situation on capital maintenance which would involve another Bill, and it would no longer be consolidated. It is simply not possible to have a consolidated Bill which holds for a lengthy period of time and, as I said, it is neither desirable nor necessary, nor what people want.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The Company Law Reform Bill has four key objectives: enhancing shareholder engagement and a long-term investment culture; ensuring better regulation and a &quot;think small first&quot; approach; making it easier to set up and run a company; and providing flexibility for the future.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Better regulation is at the heart of the Bill. As it stands, our company law was originally designed for large companies with numerous public investors, but over 90 per cent of companies have five shareholders or fewer. We have lifted from private companies the burden of unnecessary provisions, and drafted the provisions they use most often in a more accessible way. We will also ensure that small companies and their advisors have easy access to plain English guidance on what they need to know about the law.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The Bill follows the important principle, established by our predecessors, of enabling shareholders to be the primary regulators of corporate behaviour rather than the state. Companies exist for the benefit for all their members collectively and need the freedom and flexibility to create wealth. Corporate law and governance must be designed to encourage and enable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_183"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 183</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

companies to create the internal structures and controls that will promote trust and transparency, and lead to better performance.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The Bill is part of a wider programme of government and business-led reform. In 2002, we launched a review by Sir Derek Higgs on non-executive directors, which led to an updating of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. That year we also introduced regulations to require quoted companies to put the directors&#039; remuneration report to a shareholders&#039; vote. The Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 ensured better oversight and stronger regulation of the accounting and audit profession, strengthened powers to investigate companies and created the framework for community interest companies. We have also raised the audit thresholds, so that some 69,000 companies no longer have to have their accounts professionally audited.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I now come to the Bill itself, which is 885 clauses long, partly because of its simplicity, with shorter, clearer clauses. If the Opposition think that this is not a matter of great interest to small companies and businesses&#151;to have the document in a clear, simple form with short clauses&#151;they do not understand what business is about. I should add, in the light of a claim by Conservatives this morning, that the Bill is not deregulatory. It contains 885 clauses, but repeals only 642 clauses of previous Company Acts. There must be more intelligent ways of measuring the financial impact of a piece of legislation than simply counting the clauses.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>As I have shown, the Bill significantly reduces the financial burdens on industry. Also to say in the same press release that a Bill which covers such issues as directors&#039; duties, the limitation of auditors&#039; liabilities, shareholders&#039; rights and the provision of a statutory footing for the Takeover Panel is a mouse of a Bill suggests to me not so much that the Conservative Party is standing up to business as that it is losing touch with it and with reality. These are extremely important issues; they are known to be important issues to business. To describe this as a mouse of a Bill is simply to lose touch with the real world. The Bill is long and I hope that the law will be clearer as a result. I shall summarise some of the key elements.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Parts 1 to 7 of the Bill deal with the fundamentals of what a company is; how it can be formed; and what it can be called. These clauses remove any obstacles to &quot;electronic incorporation&quot;. The Bill enables the Secretary of State to set out default model articles for different descriptions of companies. We published draft default articles for private companies in our 2005 White Paper. They are radically simplified to reflect the way in which small companies operate. This approach was developed with the involvement of small companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Part 9 will ensure that companies can enable indirect investors to exercise certain governance rights. Investors today increasingly hold their shares in listed companies through intermediaries&#151;for example, through nominee holdings&#151;and thus rely on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_184"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contractual arrangements both to obtain information and to give any instructions about how they wish shares to be voted. These provisions are intended to ensure that companies can extend certain rights of members to investors holding through intermediaries. They also provide a power to make regulations to compel companies to provide information to those nominated by a member, subject to consideration of possible costs and benefits.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Part 10 introduces a statutory statement of directors&#039; general duties. The statutory statement reflects the recommendations of the Law Commission, the Scottish Law Commission and the Company Law Review, and it will provide much greater clarity on what is expected of directors. I shall highlight two points. The statutory statement is, for the most part, a codification of the current law and preserves the existing civil consequences of breach of the duties. The duties are owed to the company rather than to shareholders individually or to other stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The duty to promote the success of the company answers one of the fundamental questions in company law: &quot;in whose interests should companies be run?&quot;. In line with the recommendation of the Company Law Review, the Bill&#039;s answer is that directors should run the company for the benefit of its members collectively. However, directors will not be successful in promoting the success of the company if they focus on only the short-term financial bottom line. Successful companies see business prosperity and responsible business behaviour as two sides of the same coin. That is why, in line with the recommendation of the Company Law Review, the Bill adopts an approach known as &quot;enlightened shareholder value&quot;, under which a director must, in promoting the success of the company, have regard to factors such as the long-term consequences of business decisions and the impact of the company&#039;s activities on employees, the community and the environment.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence mirrors the tests laid down in Section 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986. As such, it reflects the judicial development of this duty in recent years and includes an objective assessment of a director&#039;s conduct.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The duties relating to directors&#039; conflicts of interest introduce two changes to the very strict principle in the current law that directors must not place themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duties to the company and their personal interests or duties to others: first, transactions between a director and the company will not have to be authorised by either the members or the board, but will instead need to be declared to the other directors; secondly, board authorisation will be permitted in respect of most conflicts of interest arising from third-party dealings by the director.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Chapter 8 of this part implements the Company Law Review&#039;s recommendation that it should be possible for any director to have his home address protected. It will no longer be necessary first to show risk of violence or intimidation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_185"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 185</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-08_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Part 11 describes the mechanism by which members may enforce directors&#039; general duties on behalf of the company. It implements the recommendation of the Law Commission that there should be more modern, flexible and accessible criteria for determining whether a shareholder can pursue such an action.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Part 12 removes the requirement on private companies to appoint a company secretary. Some such companies may wish to keep a secretary; this will be for them to decide.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The provisions in Part 13 on company decision-taking are an example of our &quot;think small first&quot; approach. The key changes are that the Bill is drafted on the basis that private companies will not need to hold annual general meetings (AGMs); it will be easier for private companies to take decisions by letter, e-mail or other electronic means; the law will extend shareholders&#039; rights to appoint proxies; shareholders of public companies will have the right to have AGM resolutions circulated at the company&#039;s expense if tabled before a certain date; and shareholders of quoted companies will have the right to request an independent report on a polled vote.


</p>

<a name="60111-08_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Parts 15 and 16 cover the accountability of officers to members. The provisions on reports and accounts have been reordered and redrafted to make it easier for companies of whatever size to find the requirements relevant to them.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that, since the Bill was introduced, the Chancellor announced the Government&#039;s intention to repeal the operating and financial review provisions that apply to quoted companies, and amending regulations were laid on 15 December. These companies will need to comply with the requirements for a business review, which are in most respects very similar. I must stress that our commitment is as strong as ever to improving strategic, forward-looking narrative reporting by companies and to enhanced dialogue with shareholders based on such reporting.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>We intend to bring forward appropriate amendments to the Bill to reflect this change of approach. Before doing so, we have invited comments on whether any particular requirements of the business review need to be clarified to achieve more effectively the Government&#039;s objectives regarding the business review and on any other considerations that we should consider in deciding how to frame suitable amendments for the Company Law Reform Bill on these matters. Some companies are considering whether to publish an OFR on a voluntary basis or to provide voluntary supplements to the business review in order to provide all the information for shareholders and others in one place. We welcome an approach that further increases transparency and the information available to shareholders.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The business review requirements should also be seen against the background of the new statutory statement of directors&#039; duties in the Bill. Views have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_186"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 186</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been invited by 15 February and we intend to take them into account before bringing forward amendments to these provisions.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Part 16 brings together and clarifies the existing provisions on auditing and adds a number of important new provisions. It will enable a company and its auditor to agree a limitation on the latter&#039;s liability, which has until now been prohibited. A limitation will require shareholders&#039; approval, and must be fair and reasonable. If not, it can be challenged and the court may substitute its own limitation. There is a new offence for those who knowingly or recklessly cause misleading, false or deceptive audit reports to be made.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>In response to concerns expressed by some of those we consulted, we have taken the opportunity to reinforce, in Parts 15 and 16, the &quot;true and fair&quot; principle that underpins the preparation and auditing of all company accounts. This is a common-sense principle that if the accounts do not provide a &quot;true and fair&quot; view of the company&#039;s financial position, directors should not sign them off and the auditors should not give an unqualified report. There are other changes designed to improve the quality of audit service.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Parts 17 to 22 deal with raising share capital and takeovers. There are a number of deregulatory measures for private companies, including abolishing the prohibition on the giving of financial assistance by private companies and enabling private companies to reduce their share capital using a new solvency statement procedure for capital reductions. This part also clarifies the circumstances in which companies may make an intra-group transfer of an asset at book value. Part 20 extends the existing power relating to transfer of securities under Section 207 of the Companies Act 1989 so that it could be used to require, as well as to permit, the paper-free holding and transfer of company shares. This reflects the work of an industry working group that has been looking at options.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Part 22 includes provisions implementing the European takeovers directive. These will place the activities of the Takeover Panel within a statutory framework for the first time. The constitutional and operational autonomy of the Takeover Panel will be maintained. However, important new powers are to be extended to the panel, including statutory rule-making powers, the right to have its decisions enforced through the courts and the ability to prescribe sanctions against those who transgress its rules. The Bill&#039;s provisions aim to ensure that tactical litigation seeking to delay or frustrate a takeover bid will not become a feature of our takeover markets. The directive needs to be implemented by 20 May. Given the length of the Bill, we have given thought to the need for interim provision, should the Bill not receive Royal Assent before that date.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Part 28 provides for greater use of electronic communications, which will enhance the immediacy of dialogue between companies and their shareholders and produce significant cost-savings. Subject to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_187"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

shareholder approval, companies will be able to use e-communications as the default position. Individual members will retain the right to request continued communication on paper if they wish.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Part 31 covers flexibility for the future. Modern legislation in technically complicated fields often leaves the more detailed provisions to subordinate legislation. Much of company law, by contrast, has been written into primary legislation. This is simply a side effect of history, but has meant that updating the law to reflect the changing business environment is not always straightforward. The Company Law Review recognised this problem, and one of its key recommendations was that in future only the principles of company law should be placed in primary legislation and the detail should be written into secondary legislation. We examined this proposal carefully but found that it was not always straightforward in practical terms and concluded, after wide consultation, that the issue would be better addressed by the creation of a Reform Power for Company Law that could be used to amend primary legislation by super-affirmative procedures. The proposed reform power is set out in Part 31 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>We recognise that the power is wide and novel, and raises significant issues which will need to be carefully considered by the House. We are grateful for the report of the Delegated Powers Committee, and the views provided by the Select Committee on the Constitution. The important contributions from these committees have raised powerful arguments against the proposal, and the Government are carefully considering the points made. At the same time, there seems to be common recognition that the problem of keeping company law up to date needs to be resolved, and the Government believe that the underlying rationale for the power remains a strong one. This is a crucial and difficult area, and I look forward to debating it.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Part 33 implements aspects of the eighth Company Law Directive on the statutory audit of accounts. We are also implementing the recommendation contained in the report <i>Holding to Account</i> by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, that the Auditor General should be able to carry out statutory audits on non-departmental public bodies.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Part 34 inserts provisions into the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 that will allow the Financial Services Authority to make rules for the purposes of the Transparency Obligations Directive. This part takes the first step in implementing the central recommendation of the <i>Morris Review of the Actuarial Profession</i>, that the Financial Reporting Council should oversee the actuarial profession. It is intended that oversight of actuaries will be put on a statutory basis in due course; in the mean time, these clauses aim to facilitate the effective operation of a voluntary regime. The Government also take a power to be able to require institutional investors, through whom the public invest in long-term savings products, to disclose how shares they own, or have an interest in, have been <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_188"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 188</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

voted. Some institutional investors are already making such disclosures. We want to see such practice extended.
</p>

<a name="60111-08_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Part 35 provides that companies in Northern Ireland will be covered directly by the Bill, which legislates for the whole of the UK. At the moment, the law in Northern Ireland is virtually identical to that in Great Britain, but it is made by separate legislation specific to Northern Ireland. This inevitably follows on behind the legislation in Great Britain and means that companies in Northern Ireland face delays before they can get the benefits of the changes being made. Recent public consultation showed that businesses and their representatives in Northern Ireland would welcome simultaneous legislation, and this is what the Bill provides. This does not affect the underlying position that company law remains in formal terms a transferred matter, and a future Northern Ireland Assembly will be able to legislate separately if it so chooses.

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>This is a long Bill but it will bring significant improvements in many areas of company law. It has the potential to bring significant savings for business, delivers on the &quot;think small first&quot; principle, and updates the law for the benefit of our largest companies. It also benefits investors. Many people have been involved in the thinking behind this Bill and we are very grateful for all the input we have received. The reason why the Bill has been so widely welcomed is due to the close involvement over a number of years of so many interested parties. I trust that it will attract a similar degree of support from this House, and commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="60111-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I must begin by thanking the Minister for his gallant attempt to pr&#233;cis this gargantuan Bill. I apologise for my merriment, but his belief that the need to simplify company law gave rise to a Bill of 885 clauses seemed a little far-fetched to me in the first instance. No doubt we shall discuss that in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>It is also only fair that I should congratulate the Government on finally bringing forward the Bill. We have certainly been waiting a long&#151;some would say a very long&#151;time for it. In her forward to the White Paper, <i>Modernising Company Law</i>, published in July 2002, the then Secretary of State, Patricia Hewitt, wrote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;Now our challenge is to build on this by promoting enterprise and raising productivity. Market frameworks drive enterprise and productivity, and company law is a key part of that framework.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>That is why my predecessor at the Department of Trade and Industry . . . launched the Company Law Review in 1998&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>By my calculations, that means that it is seven years since the Government set out on this road and seven years seems an unconscionably long time to complete&#151;if we have completed&#151;what the Government described as a key part of the framework. Anyway, we are where we are and we welcome the appearance of the Bill.

</p>

<a name="60111-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I had the pleasure of working with the Minister during the passage of the Companies (Audit, Investigation and Community Enterprise) Bill when it came through the House in the spring of 2004. A number of us asked the Minister when the main course&#151;we regarded the 2004 Bill as merely an appetiser&#151;would be served. The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, from whom we are all looking forward to hearing later, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;It has only recently occurred to me that we have been prompted to introduce . . . the Bill, representing only a small morsel of company law reform, because of the slow pace of company law reform in general. I look forward to the day when the Minister presides over a big companies Bill, one brought forward in 2005, 2006 or 2007&#151;no doubt he will still be in office&#151;but so many matters are now urgent in company law reform that some have now overtaken the Company Law Review&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Does the Minister recall his reply? Perhaps I can refresh his memory. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;I am pleased that my noble friend Lord Wedderburn is looking forward to the day when I will bring forward a new companies Act. My personal view is that I hope I will have been sacked or some other act of God will have intervened before such a happy occasion takes place&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>,<i> </i>17/03/04; col. GC110 and 115.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Clearly the Prime Minister thinks that the Minister is doing such an outstanding job that he cannot be moved and this whopping great Bill is to be his reward.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Your Lordships&#039; House can claim to have a special expertise in matters of company law. The galaxy of talent that will be contributing to our debate today shows that. Perhaps I will be forgiven if I say that I am particularly looking forward to the maiden speech of my noble friend Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone. Before I go any further, I need to declare some interests. I am a director of five companies, one listed on the Stock Exchange, one a mutual company and three private companies. I am also a trustee of two pension funds and chairman of the trustees of one of them. All of those appear on the Register of Members&#039; Interests.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The press release that accompanied the publication of this Bill at the beginning of November suggested three major strategic objectives for the Bill: promoting enterprise and stimulating investment in the United Kingdom; making the law more accessible and thinking small first; and contributing to a better regulation agenda. Who could object to such worthy aims? My party certainly does not, so we are happy to give an in-principle welcome to the Bill if&#151;and it is a big if&#151;the actual provisions of the Bill fulfil these objectives.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The Minister has already argued that, given the length of time, all the proposals contained in the Bill have been heavily trailed and consulted on. That may be so, but coming as I do fresh from a marathon session on the Charities Bill&#151;60 hours in Committee and a Bill which it was claimed had been equally widely consulted on&#151;I have to say to the Minister that the appearance of proposals in statutory form has an extraordinarily mind-focusing affect on people for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_190"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 190</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whom up to now it has been something of an academic exercise. So we shall be consulting widely and probing the Government&#039;s policy ideas deeply and carefully.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The main yardsticks by which we on these Benches shall be judging the Bill are three. First, is it deregulatory as the Government claim? When I was a small boy, my grandmother used to say to me, on occasions when she felt that I had been a little careless in the accuracy with which I had reported events to her, &quot;That makes my toe tingle&quot;. Faced with a Bill of 508 pages, 885 clauses and 15 schedules, which the Minister claims is deregulatory, I have to say to him, &quot;That makes my toe tingle&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>In this connection, the Minister&#039;s colleague in the other place, Mr Gerry Sutcliffe, when introducing the Bill to the All-Party Group on Corporate Governance, described it as deregulatory. I asked him how many clauses of previous Companies Acts would be repealed in consequence. He did not know. He referred the matter to his officials who were present. They did not know either. Not exactly an encouraging start.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The second yardstick is: does it make company law more comprehensible&#151;or, as the Government like to say, &quot;accessible&quot;? The Minister will recall from our debates on the previous Companies Bill my frequent complaint about the archaeological nature of company law&#151;layer upon layer of changes piled on one another, making the subject incomprehensible to all but the <i>cognoscenti</i>.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>It seems to me that in this connection the Government have failed in at least one major respect: even after we have dealt with this monster, we have still not rid ourselves of the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989. It is not clear why some parts of the 1985 Act have been moved across and others not. For example, Clause 152 of this Bill repeats word for word Section 303 of the 1985 Act, the resolutions to remove a director. Others have been moved in part and so now straddle the Bill and the 1985 Act. For example, the reduction of capital&#151;a complex area&#151;is now split between Clause 561 of the Bill and Section 135 of the 1985 Act. Finally, some have not been moved at all. Would the Minister not agree that if the Government wanted to make the law more accessible, consolidation should have been completed and not left half done?
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The third yardstick is: do the proposals strike the right balance? We need a dynamic corporate sector and we need men and women of high quality to serve as executive and non-executive directors. Do these proposals achieve this? It is all too easy to ossify our corporate structures by a series of box-ticking, risk-averse measures. The Minister should not forget the Schumpeter doctrine of the need for &quot;gales of creative destruction&quot; as an essential, if uncomfortable, part of a dynamic economy.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Before turning to the Bill itself, I should let the Minister know that my noble friend Lady Noakes has agreed to focus her formidable intellect and forensic accounting experience on Parts 15, 16 and 33. She has also kindly agreed to wind up the debate today. My noble friend Lord Freeman has agreed to turn his experienced eye to the important provisions of Part 10, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_191"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 191</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which relate to company directors and their duties. I am grateful to them both. For the rest of the Bill, the Minister will, I am afraid, have to put up with me.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>I turn now to the Bill itself. Obviously I cannot deal with all our points in a huge piece of legislation such as this in a short speech. I have to confine myself to certain major areas. First, I am happy to accept the Minister&#039;s invitation to congratulate the draftsmen and the Government on the way the Bill has been put together. It follows a helpfully logical sequence and this will undoubtedly assist our process of scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>But this leads to a general point. A substantial proportion of the Bill is made up of sections transposed from the 1985 Act. The transposition is not, in all cases, on a word-for-word basis. The Minister, I am sure, will argue that such wording changes are merely to reflect modern usage and parlance. But he should be aware that many company lawyers do not see it thus; rather they are concerned that changes in wording may be seen in the courts subsequently as indicating a change in the wishes of Parliament. So we shall be tabling a number of amendments, on a probing basis, to enable the Minister to explain on the Floor of the House when wording changes are just that and when they indicate a shift in policy and thinking.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Secondly, there is the familiar issue of regulations. As is so often the case today, the Bill we are discussing is, in many cases, a skeleton of principles&#151;the detailed flesh and blood will be contained in regulations. The power to make regulations appears in some 16 different places in the Bill. While principles clearly are to stand alone, the quality of our scrutiny will be much improved if we know something about the detail the Government have in mind.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Could the Minister let us know which sets of draft regulations he expects to be able to publish in time for the Committee Stage of the relevant sections?


</p>

<a name="60111-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Turning to specifics, our first major area of concern arises with Part 9, the exercise of members&#039; rights. On these Benches we believe strongly in the concept of a share-owning democracy. Such a democracy will flourish and grow if individuals feel involved in the performance of the companies they invest in. To feel involved people need information. More and more people, quite sensibly, hold their shares in PEPs or ISAs, the holdings of which perforce have to be in the manager&#039;s nominee name. It is not clear to us whether the provisions of Part 9, as presently drafted, are likely to lead to a proper degree of dissemination of information about the performance of individual companies to their shareholders. Indeed, there is a feel to this and other parts of the Bill that makes one think it has been drafted with big companies and big shareholders in mind. We want to ensure that the interests of the small battalions are not overlooked.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>I am sure we will want to have a serious look at Part 10, which concerns company directors. UK plc needs men and women of the highest quality to lead from the front and it is crucial that we do not scare these people away. For this reason, my noble friend Lord Freeman intends to look carefully at this part and ensure that the right balance has been struck.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_192"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I turn next to Part 11: I noticed in the <i>Financial Times,</i> on Wednesday 9 November, a letter from Alun Michael MP in which he stated that the derivative action, as detailed in Part 11 of the Bill, does little more than elevate to a statutory basis a long-held common law procedure. As the Minister knows, I am no lawyer. However, the legal advice we have received suggests that as the law currently stands this is available only where the wrong done to the company amounts to fraud and the wrongdoers themselves are in control of the company and thus able to prevent the company from suing. By contrast, this Bill will allow a derivative action by minority shareholders in cases of negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust. We wait to see whether the Minister will stand by his colleague in the other place in his claim that this is not a major change in the law.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>We shall also wish to explore the abolition of the requirement that private companies have company secretaries, addressed in Part 12. This is an issue that has been fiercely fought over by parties on both sides of the argument, and I think it is fair to say that the final position published in the Bill is not one that was anticipated during negotiations. It is clear that in some circumstances company secretaries may not provide value, for example for particularly small companies. However, there comes a size at which they do begin to add value and clarity, even for private companies, in defining the functions and duties of a company and thus providing protection to shareholders. We want to ensure that this line is drawn in the correct place.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>I know we want to look at the implications of Part 14, which lays out the basis for political donations by companies. I am all for transparency but we also need fairness, and what is sauce for the corporate goose must also be sauce for the trades union gander.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>As I said earlier, my noble friend Lady Noakes will be dealing with Parts 15 and 16. I am sure she will wish to discuss auditors&#039; liability and a number of other points covered in these chapters. All I wish to do now is to ask the Minister whether, in light of his earlier comments, this means that he will be tabling an amendment to leave out Clauses 393 to 395, which concern the Operating and Financial Review. From his remarks, it was not quite clear to me whether that was being abandoned.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>One of the Government&#039;s stated aims, as I pointed out, is to modernise and simplify business in the UK. A proposal in the White Paper in March 2005 was the dematerialisation of share certificates. The Bill reflects this in Part 20, Clauses 585 to 587, which provide a power for the Secretary of State to require all quote companies to issue electronic share certificates. The Bill requires the Secretary of State to consult before exercising this power. However, there are those who are concerned that this is not the right way to implement modernisation, nor that the requirement to consult goes far enough. There is a fear that any exercise of such a power would be very likely to be unfair to the smaller shareholder&#151;an end result that does not fit well with the Government&#039;s objective of thinking &quot;small first.&quot; I hope the Minister will be able to allay my fears in this regard.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_193"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 193</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-09_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>The Takeover Panel has been one of the great regulatory successes of the last 30 years and has played an important role in the continuing prominence of London as a world class financial centre. Its ability to operate in a free-flow manner has led to it being respected as quick, flexible and responsive to the needs of the mergers and acquisitions market. We understand the purpose of the EU Takeovers Directive which is contained in the provisions of Part 22, but we will wish to probe for any gold-plating of the directive and whether there is any risk to the methods of operating which have been an integral part of the Takeover Panel&#039;s success to date.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>The Minister will also have noticed the concerns expressed by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee at paragraph 15 of its report on the Bill about the interface between the panel&#039;s unlimited power to levy penalties, its stand-alone membership and this first appearance in statute law. We shall wish to examine this difficult balance.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>We expect to hold a major debate on the reform power in Part 31. We agree that to meet the demands of UK plc, company law needs to be malleable and adaptable to the changing environment. However, we also need to be sure that the procedure proposed allows for a proper degree of parliamentary scrutiny and public consultation. Again, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has undertaken an invaluable service in highlighting the complex issues involved.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>To conclude, we on these Benches give an in-principle welcome to the Bill. But it is clear that there is a lot of work for us to do to illuminate, tease out and clarify its detailed provisions. Company law reform may not set many parliamentary pulses racing, but, as the Minister pointed out, it has a huge influence for good or ill on British industry and commerce.
</p>

<a name="60111-09_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>My final point is not related to a specific part of the Bill. Instead, I look to Europe. It is my understanding that a number of changes to directives may influence how UK authorities may apply company law. I am also aware that the Commission is expected to announce shortly a review of the company law action plan. Will the Minister reassure me that the Bill will not be immediately rendered otiose by future changes in EU law? If we all find ourselves back here next year discussing a new company law reform Bill, then I can only share his 2004 hope that we will all have been sacked or that God will have stepped in during the intervening period.

<a name="60111-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   My Lords, I must first declare an interest: I am the chairman of two listed companies, and I sit on the board of two others.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I, too, welcome the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said, it is long overdue. We have asked for it on many previous occasions. I welcome the aims behind the Bill, which the Minister has outlined <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_194"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 194</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

succinctly, particularly those of simplicity in regulation. I give a particular welcome to the provision that implements my recommendation.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>This is a huge piece of legislation. The changes are very significant&#151;it undertakes a root-and-branch reform of the law. Given the Bill&#039;s importance to the business community, the investing community and other stakeholders, I would have liked to have been able to support it without any reservations. But sadly, I cannot. Some concerns have already been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and I will not repeat in detail what he has said. However, I join him in expressing concern&#151;disappointment, really&#151;that the Government have not produced a consolidating Bill. I note what the Minister says about the rationale behind the Bill, but I cannot agree with his reasoning. We still end up with the 1985 Act partly repealed, and company law contained in both the 1985 Act and this Bill&#151;what the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, referred to as an archaeological approach to company law, although it is to be hoped that we now have a shallower dig. I look at this rather like peeling back the layers of an onion&#151;we do not have so many layers to peel back but we still have it to deal with, and I am not entirely convinced that this is the right way to go about it.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>My second major concern is the wide powers taken in Part 31 to introduce changes in future by use of regulation. I do not object to that in principle; in particular, I believe that the ability to respond quickly is a very valuable tool. But I am concerned that the Bill does not give us much guidance and I would like to hear about the processes of consultation. How wide will it be? Who will determine it? The Bill seems to indicate that that will be entirely in the hands of the Secretary of State. I would also like to hear about whether the outcome of that consultation and the regulations proposed will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Thirdly, I turn to the troubled issue of the Operating and Financial Review and its relationship with the business review for all companies. I thought I heard the Minister say that he would introduce proposals to eliminate the need for that. Sadly, as most people will acknowledge, the Chancellor&#039;s statement abolishing the OFR simply did not earn him the brownie points from the business community that he anticipated. In my judgment, he had not understood that many companies are already a long way down the track in producing these kinds of reports. Investing bodies like the notion of an OFR and the issues that have given rise to concern did not involve whether there should be an OFR, but involved some of the data that were to be required&#151;for example, the degree to which forward-looking data had to be included; whether confidential commercial information by way of key performance indicators needed to be in there; and an earlier concern which had been put right about the degree of care. All of those issues could have been dealt with and resolved.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I do not believe that we have got to the right solution here. We have about a third of corporate value tied up in intangibles and we now have IFRS numbers being produced. They are highly volatile and not widely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_195"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

understood by the investing community. More than ever now there is a need for good quality corporate reporting. The expectations of investors and the NGOs in the corporate social responsibility community&#151;if I can use that phrase&#151;are high, which inevitably impacts on the reputation of business. We already have the Accounting Standards Board and the Institute of Directors talking about incorporating an OFR requirement within the combined code. I have no doubt whatever that companies will continue to produce OFRs regardless of whether there is a statutory requirement. It would be useful if the Minister could clarify, perhaps with more detail, where we are heading on this matter and whether it is to be left to the FRC or the ASB to produce something outside the legislative framework.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Finally, on matters affecting the Bill as a whole, I return to the issue of European company law reform and the directives being issued. I understand that matters of company dividend distributions could not be dealt with in the Bill because they will be dealt with in the European fifth directive. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will continue to press for a change in the basis by which company dividends can be made away from a reserves-based distribution to a solvency test? The reason for that is again related to the issue of IFRS standards. As I said before, results are becoming extremely volatile. We have all sorts of funny things going through accounts today which previously did not. The result is that companies are beginning to engage in transactions to create distributable reserves at the right point within the group. It would be much better, and much simpler, if we moved to a straight solvency-based test for determining whether dividends can be paid.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Those points cover the overall Bill. However, I want to draw the attention of the House to several areas in which we support the intentions behind the Bill but on which we have reservations whether the Bill as drafted will be workable or achieve the desired objectives. The first relates to directors, and the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, has already referred to Part 10. The notion that corporate endeavour, on which old-style corporate legislation was based, is a partnership between the providers of capital and the management of an enterprise has been overtaken by a more broadly-based model, reflected in this Bill, commonly referred to as enhanced shareholder value.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>We welcome that, but the clauses in Chapter 2 of Part 10 in particular are flawed and not workable. Commentators such as the Law Society, while supporting the aims of clarification of directors&#039; duties&#151;which I also support&#151;does not believe that that has been achieved. The new provisions are said by the guidance notes to provide greater clarity on what is expected of directors and make the development of the law in this area more predictable. However, it is argued that the provisions are inflexible and will restrict the courts. The code has not adopted common law terminology and introduces new concepts that will make remedies more difficult to apply. For example, Clause 156(3) requires directors to fulfil their duties,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;so far as reasonably practicable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_196"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>We are advised that that it is both ambiguous and otiose. We question whether it will require senior directors to set up expensive and extensive internal procedures to create audit trails in respect of any authority which they delegate down the management chain.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>My second concern relates to the provisions creating a new regime under which shareholders may bring actions for negligence, default, breach of duty and breach of trust. While there are safeguards linked to the statement of directors&#039; duties, there are concerns about the potential for abuse and particularly the timing of court involvement. Why is it not possible to have the court involved earlier in the process so that you do not engage in a waste of time which the court then throws out?
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The third area of concern is the exercise of voting rights by institutional investors. Essentially, what is called a long-stop measure has been taken&#151;a power to require voting disclosure. I am unsure why that is necessary. The Company Law Review said that it was desirable, for example, for beneficiaries, members of pension funds and so forth. However, in very many cases the voting policy of intermediaries is actually defined by contract. The pension fund has a contract with the investment manager telling them how they will and will not vote. So I am not sure what one gains by telling them that they have done the job. A good voluntary system is operating and it would be better to wait and see whether it produces the results that we want rather than legislate in advance.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Finally, on auditor liability, the relevant clauses seem to require monetary capping. Certainly that is the advice that I have received. I understand that the policy&#151;which was agreed by the companies, investing bodies and the auditors themselves&#151;was to be a system based on proportional liability. I am advised that the clauses as drafted will require the inclusion of a monetary cap. If that is the case, then I believe that the result will be an acceleration of cap amount to a very high level which would probably be affordable by only one or two accounting firms and would naturally lead to a very significant reduction in competition. I do not endorse that. I think that the matter can be put right by a relatively simple amendment in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>There are many other areas of detail to which we will wish to return in Committee. I say again, however, that we welcome the Bill. It is long overdue and the House has our assurance that we will endeavour in Committee and at subsequent stages of the Bill to help ensure that it provides the foundation in law for the future competitiveness and success of British companies.

<a name="60111-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I am pleased to follow the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, with whom I have had the pleasure of conducting a certain amount of business in the past. I am also glad that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is here because some 22 years ago we crossed swords in the nicest possible way over the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_197"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Companies Bill of the then Labour government. I am glad to say that there is not much fundamental difference between us on that score.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>As my noble friend the Minister has said, the Bill is incredibly long. I support what it contains, for the most part. Of course, unlike some of its predecessors, it is highly intelligible. It modernises company law and, like many others, I think that what has been achieved today is much overdue. I am sure that, for these good reasons, it will play a major role in attracting companies to this country. The Minister and all those responsible for advising him are to be congratulated on what has been accomplished, but it is a pity that company law is still to be found in so many different pieces of legislation.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I am not entirely persuaded by my noble friend that there is not a case for consolidation. I think there is and the Committee will certainly wish to consider that point. After all, this Bill consolidates certain provisions already. It is not beyond the wit of man&#151;and it would be welcomed by many practitioners&#151;that we should seek some further consolidation in the nearer future than is envisaged. So, I await a single company law Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Although I generally support the aims of this Bill, almost inevitably I have some criticisms because it is so long. The Company Law Review carried out a fundamental review of company law in 1998. It concluded that companies should owe a primary duty to shareholders. But, assuredly&#151;as the review recommended&#151;in relation to that, companies must have regard to the interests of employees, to the communities in which the company operates, to the environment and to the company&#039;s stakeholders. In other words, it is necessary to strike a balance between varying interests, which. I am not entirely sure that this Bill accomplishes. Personally, I would have preferred an extension of a director&#039;s legal duties to employees and, indeed, to other stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Despite the reservations which I have articulated, the approach of this Bill is to be preferred to the present position. In parenthesis, do the Government propose another more basic review of company law? If so, do they have any intention of changing the way in which the boardroom goes about examining those matters which come before it
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Reference has been made to Part 10, Chapter 2, of the Bill. In my view, it would be desirable to detail the duties of directors in a more comprehensive way. Is that not the most appropriate way in which to ensure that directors behave in a way that is wholly consistent with the requirements that are imposed upon them? At the very least, if the Government refuse to go down that path, should there not be a non-statutory guide to directors&#039; duties as has been suggested by the Law Society?
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I am somewhat puzzled about the phrase that directors must act,

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>in carrying out their legal duties, in so far as employees and shareholders are concerned, as set out in Clause 156(3)(a) to (f). How will that work in practice? Does it mean that the views of employees and other stakeholders must be taken into account as a question of law? What in other words does it mean?
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Why are the Government repealing the legal need for quoted companies to produce an Operating and Financial Review&#151;referred to as OFR? Will not that require some legislative amendments to the Bill, or require them to undertake another enactment? The Minister must surely know that many noble Lords who are likely to participate in this debate, and the TUC, are deeply concerned that the business review is not nearly as potent as the OFR in giving shareholders and stakeholders the insight needed to ensure that the company&#039;s operations will truly be in the interests of the company and the nation.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Why are medium-sized companies exempt from the strict requirements that are imposed on larger companies with regard to non-financial information? Why should not all companies include non-financial information in their business review? Why should not relevant information on social and community issues be included in the business review, as required at present in the OFR?
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Under Part 31 of the Bill, the Government propose that after consultation a company law reform order may prescribe changes in company law. Will my noble friend outline more specifically than he has done the machinery as to how company law reform is to be undertaken? How can we be satisfied that public consultation and parliamentary observations will have been taken properly into account? Of course, there does need to be a fast-track procedure in this behalf but, equally, we must be satisfied that the caveats that I have mentioned are observed. In this connection, how do the Government intend to deal with the criticisms that have been launched on this procedure by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee? There is a real dilemma here. I prefer the way the Government have gone about this, but I think it is incumbent upon my noble friend to deal with that particular criticism.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Finally, I will deal with political donations and expenditure, in Part 14 of the Bill. In general, I support these provisions, but I am concerned about the exact meaning of what is prescribed. The Law Society has iterated its anxieties in this connection. In particular, would the following represent political donations: corporate entertainment sponsored by companies offered to members of political parties; or politicians being paid for speaking at seminars and conferences?
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Although I am critical of certain aspects of the Bill, it is certainly a great improvement on what we have seen in the past. Despite my criticisms, the Government deserve our support.

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 199</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

second of these objectives. The first is even more important. Few could quarrel with the stated objectives of the Bill. My noble friend Lord Hodgson eloquently made the points about the growing gap between the exciting rhetoric and the possible reality that might be developing. Nevertheless, I am well aware of the obligation to avoid controversy when first addressing your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The Government made a wise choice in introducing this lengthy and complex Bill in this House in the light of the detailed knowledge and distinguished experience of so many in this place. The immediate comments of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, make the point all too clearly. I feel privileged to join your Lordships and I am deeply appreciative of the welcome I have received. As a Member for 21 years in the other place, I have long had great respect for the proceedings of your Lordships&#039; Chamber in terms of the care and attention to detail and the generally constructive and non-partisan approach to legislation. If ever there was a really difficult and complex Bill to be introduced when in Government, I did all I could to ensure that it went to the Lords first.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The growth of business is the driving force behind economic development and reform over recent centuries. As the Minister himself said, the creation of joint stock companies and the limitation of individual liability, together with the competence of many Scottish engineers, helped the accumulation and the use of capital. All this led to increasing prosperity in Britain and around the world. Only last week a Heritage Foundation report suggested that in economic terms the UK is the fifth most free country in the world, higher than the US.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>A major indicator of economic freedom, as the Minister said, is how easy it is to set up and administer companies. Overall, we have done well, and we do not want to go backwards. Starting and running a business is a component in providing opportunity for those coming to this country, including black and ethnic minorities. They can become successful, contributing economically and socially to society. Analysis of the recent riots in France suggests that excessive obstacles in setting up small businesses there prevent enterprising migrants developing a similar stake in the community.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I have long been aware of the need to create wealth if we are to fund welfare. Thirty-five years ago, as an idealistic young social scientist working for Frank Field&#151;now a Member in another place&#151;on low-income families, I produced my first report for the <i>Guardian</i>, and published a CPAG pamphlet. It was sent by my father, John Garnett, then leading the Industrial Society, to Sir Keith Joseph, a distinguished former Member of this House. I was summoned to see him, in a state of anxiety similar to that in which I am addressing your Lordships today, and he firmly reminded me that it is so much easier to divide the cake up than to bake it in the first place. There are many socially-reforming measures on which I hope to make a contribution in this House. The only way to realise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_200"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 200</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

these ambitions is to pay equal attention to the wealth and employment-creating capacity of our nation. So let me speak more about the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>We have some of the best corporate governance in the world and we must not let a rigid legislative approach compromise the pragmatism and flexibility that has helped us prosper. Ours is a principle rather than a rules-based system. Excessive regulation leads to additional administration. Directors become policemen and box-tickers, rather than strategists contributing to successful wealth-creating companies. As the Minister in his own maiden speech said, the success of business depends on,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;enterprise, vision and skills . . . Government cannot provide a substitute for that&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/1/98; col. 863.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-11_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Legislation and regulation cannot stop company fraud. We should develop mechanisms to ensure that alarm bells ring earlier. We must train people to recognise the signs. We must empower people to be independent and courageous in their views. We must encourage critical friends. Independent non-executive directors can play a key role. I was pleased that the Minister highlighted the work of Sir Derek Higgs in his recent report.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Before going any further let me declare my own interests as set out in the Register. I am an executive director of Odgers Ray & Berndtson, heading the board practice and so involved on a day-to-day basis with the identification and selection of directors to serve on all manner of bodies. I also sit on a number of both commercial and charitable boards, nationally and internationally.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Corporate Britain needs talented directors, both executive and non-executive. But there are already ominous warning signs that the liabilities and constraints involved are preventing some of the most talented from taking up the challenge. The danger of this legislation is that non-executive directors, contrary, I am sure, to the intentions of the Government, will be further deterred or will act defensively rather than independently and, where necessary, courageously.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Patience Wheatcroft, the <i>Times</i> business and city editor, predicted that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;2006 could be the year when quoted companies find that there are simply not enough directors to go round. The rewards do not compensate for the risks involved and people of the right calibre will not volunteer&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-11_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>She is not alone. There are indications that sought-after individuals are reluctant to join a board, preferring to serve in an advisory or consultative fashion. FTSE 100 companies will be fine with their strong brands, but it is often the smaller businesses, which may need the NED contribution more, that will be vulnerable. It is welcome that the Government are calling for greater diversity in the board room, but these measures may deter precisely those potential NEDs they most wish to attract.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Extending the provisions for the indemnification of directors is obviously a welcome step, and those who know, as I know well, Jennie Page, who has been so scarred by recent episodes with Equitable Life, will <br>&nbsp;<br>

appreciate that this may take a step forward. She is a public servant of great ability and integrity. Recently she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;It&#039;s very difficult to think the circumstances of non-executives are well-defined or well-protected in this day and age . . . If a climate of litigation by boards against their predecessors becomes a generality, you can see how being a non-executive could be a very dangerous thing to be&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-11_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Sharman and Lord Hodgson, have already spoken about the dangers envisaged in the analysis of directors&#039; duties contained in the Bill. There is a real concern that the statutory code could be unworkable and counterproductive. It may make more work for those from the previous profession of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, but directors may feel that they will not be able to move without consulting lawyers as to whether they have complied with the legislation. The strength of the present flexible arrangements is that they are adaptable, flexible and allow for exception&#151;comply or explain.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The point about the measures being &quot;so far as reasonably practical&quot; has been well-covered. The previous wording of &quot;where relevant&quot; seems a much stronger argument. Much may be practical, but not relevant. To have to do something that is practical but not relevant on risk-based proportionality principles would be a significant burden and a diversion of energy. Similarly, the provisions relating to the avoidance of conflict of interest are complex to navigate. It will frequently be far from clear to directors whether a conflict exists.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>In helping directors to resolve all these matters, the first port of call in most circumstances is the company secretary. I am with those who argue most strongly that we should hold on to company secretaries wherever possible. Very often they are the guardians of the corporate governance structure. They are pivotal in influencing and monitoring the governance of a company, advising on new developments and compliance with codes of practice, regulation and corporate law. They ensure the follow-up of board decisions. They are a primary source of information for executive directors and shareholders alike, and I very much hope that the Minister will look again at this matter.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>In recent months, Sir Bryan Nicholson has handled the revised, combined code with great skill and effectiveness. I welcome the Minister&#039;s reassurances about the FRC, but I am concerned about the moves in Clause 861 to make the FSA, rather than the FRC, the competent authority to make rules about corporate governance. It may be that that is connected with complying with European legislation, but I hope the Minister will agree that the strength of the UK&#039;s corporate governance regime, for which the FRC is responsible, is its flexibility and the degree to which it commands support in the business and investor communities, and that is precisely because it operates on a non-statutory basis. Can he give undertakings that powers will be taken under this clause only if there is full consultation in advance? The rules of the FSA should be used only as a last resort.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_202"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-11_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Perhaps I may turn briefly to the subject of charitable enterprises. Like many others in this House, I serve on a number of charitable bodies: the Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum, the Ditchley Foundation and, closer to home, the Industry and Parliament Trust. These are charitable companies limited by guarantee. Something like 20,000 charities on the register have the same structure and, although there is some mention of them in the Bill, particularly in regard to the exemption from audit clauses, there are a number of contradictions elsewhere. In particular, the rules on conflicts of interest and duty may possibly have a damaging effect on charities. The impression is given that those rules have been influenced by the assumption that directors are paid, whereas of course with charities that is the exception rather than the norm. After the care and deliberation that this House has given to the Charities Bill, I suggest to the Minister that there needs to be further consideration of the way in which this latest legislation will impact if it is not to create a two-tier system of trustees on charities and possibly open charities to some unfortunate developments.
</p>

<a name="60111-11_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>After 22 years in another place, although only a few months in your Lordships&#039; House, I am well aware that the best legislative intentions can easily result in unintended and damaging consequences in practice. I recognise the formidable degree of consultation that has been invested in the preparation of this Bill. I have every confidence that the Minister, in his characteristic manner, will give detailed consideration to the serious concerns raised by myself and many others in this debate.

<a name="60111-12_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that I speak for the whole House in expressing to the noble Baroness our very warm welcome and our congratulations on her most impressive maiden speech, which achieved the very difficult aim of being very interesting while still remaining within the convention of non-controversiality. As everyone here is aware, the noble Baroness has had a very distinguished career in the other place. The records reveal that, on top of that, she also has a wide range of non-political interests. It is a privilege to have the noble Baroness among us, especially when she says that, even when she was in another place, she appreciated the usefulness of this House. We look forward to her active and valuable participation in our future deliberations.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I shall speak only about one particular part of the Bill. Part 31 is completely different from the rest of the Bill, which deals with, codifies and amends the laws relating to companies and their workings. Part 31, on the other hand, creates an entirely novel system of legislating which, if approved, could be used in many other fields of law. It sets up a system whereby virtually the entirety of company law, with a very few, limited exceptions, can in future be amended in any way, and to any extent, by statutory order rather than primary legislation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_203"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>These statutory orders are subject to a special, super-affirmative procedure, but the hard fact remains that this is a wholesale proposal for major legislation by statutory instrument. This procedure has been considered by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, the chairman of which I see in his place, which reported as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Despite the limitations in clauses 776 to 782 and the super-affirmative procedure, we consider that the proposed delegation of power in Part 31 is inappropriate and we recommend that the House seeks its removal from the bill&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>That is a powerful recommendation from that highly important and respected committee. The chairman of the Select Committee on the Constitution, of which I am a member, has also written a strong letter to the Minister endorsing that recommendation. The part therefore comes with the disapproval of two of your Lordships&#039; committees entrusted with looking at matters of this kind.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>There are two basic objections to this proposal. First, any proposal that Parliament should adopt a new system for enacting legislation should be brought forward in a separate Bill, not tucked away as Clauses 774 to 788 of a Bill of 508 pages, which is apparently destined to be relegated to a Grand Committee. If one had such a separate Bill, it would certainly merit wide consultation and discussion, and would probably be the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny. It could and would be much more fully considered by the relevant committees of your Lordships&#039; House, and would attract and obtain the attention of the many Members of this House who have a keen interest in, and wide knowledge of, the legislative process as opposed to the intricacies of company law. That is demonstrated by the fact that all the speakers so far have only been able to make fleeting reference to this part; not because they consider it unimportant, but because there is so much else to be talked about.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>Secondly, if one has to look at the matter in the context of this Bill, and not in the context of a general enabling measure, the powers given are far too wide and the safeguards virtually non-existent. The Minister recognises that the power is &quot;wide and novel&quot;, and wrote a detailed letter seeking to justify it and indicate safeguards. He says that there are many instances where there is a need to update company legislation, or to make amendments to deal with difficulties that have arisen, such as an unforeseen decision of a court. That is accepted, and is a point upon which he has the support of the Law Society. I recognise the force of that argument, and I would see force in this proposal if it could be limited to matters which were both relatively minor and genuinely uncontroversial. Seemingly, however, it cannot be so limited, or so the Minister says. It is wrong to invite Parliament to abolish control of important legislation for mere convenience.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The Minister further says that developments of company law have, in the past, not involved major political controversy. This is probably strictly true if one interprets political controversy as meaning party political controversy, but an absence of party political controversy does not mean that many past, and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_204"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 204</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

potential future, proposed amendments have not been matters of great importance and of widely differing views.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The noble Lord stated that company law,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;is essentially a balance between different interests&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>That is just so, and it follows that any proposal to alter that balance is likely to have both strong support and strong opposition. We have just heard one example of that point from the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, who drew attention to the conflict between the desire of some people to hold directors to blame when things go wrong, and the need to recruit really good directors, particularly good non-executive directors, who are not put off by the enormous fear of litigation, which, even if they succeed in it, will be enormously costly and time-consuming. I speak as someone who has brought quite a bit of that litigation.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The powers given by this part of the Bill apply to virtually the entirety of company law and to any amendment, however major, made to that law. The principle that is embodied in this part is equally applicable to many other aspects of the law where one could say that there is a frequent need to update. The Minister recognises this and he states: &quot;We&quot;&#151;by which he means this Government&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;would not intend to use the power for proposals which are large and politically controversial&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>He therefore proposes to make some undertakings.

<a name="60111-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>However, I do not believe, and I do not believe that your Lordships believe, that it is right to pass an enactment that makes so radical a change, which the Government themselves recognise gives over-wide powers, on the mere undertaking that this Government&#151;they cannot bind their successors&#151;will not fully exercise those powers.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>If the matter were considered, as I suggest that it should be, in a Bill of its own to set up some fast-track procedure for minor and non-controversial amendments, I am by no means certain that it would be impossible to devise genuine and effective safeguards that prevented the use of such powers in inappropriate circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, who is also a member of the Constitution Committee, has suggested that one of your Lordships&#039; committees could be required to examine each proposal for the use of this power in the light of any objections or criticisms which are made. If that committee decided that the secondary legislation was not apt, the Government would be debarred from going ahead.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I hope that the Government will accede to the plea of the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, and agree to remove this part from the Bill. If they are not willing to do that, Part 31 must be recommitted to a Committee of the whole House after it has been in Grand Committee so that this important matter of constitutional principle can be given the full consideration which it requires.

<a name="60111-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, from the government Benches, I add to the welcome and congratulations offered by the noble Viscount to the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone, on her maiden speech, which we so much enjoyed. We enjoyed her speech, and we look forward to enjoying other speeches on other subjects in the future.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>This Labour Government have often been accused of being anti-small business. There is plenty of evidence in numerous provisions of this Bill which proves otherwise. The Company Law Review was initiated by this Government in 1998. Although, as the Minister has said, many organisations and individuals have contributed along the road in consultation to the final outcome, it can be said that the chief driver behind the Bill are the Government and that its final construction is their work.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>However, it has already been expressed by the Government and elsewhere, that there will be some disappointment in the country at the failure of the Government, after eight years, to produce a fully consolidated measure that brings together the totality of company law in one piece of legislation. I will be glad if the Minister will comment on this, because sometimes I think that the time is never ripe for halting change and setting out all the existing law conveniently in a readily accessible single statute. Only this week, when we are discussing this partially consolidated Bill, the EU Commission, which initiates a number of changes nowadays in a way that was not the case years ago, has tabled interesting proposals for enhancing the rights of cross-border shareholders. At some time, somewhere along the line, they may need to be put into effect in the UK.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I started by saying that the Bill is pro-small business. There are many welcome provisions to that effect: for example, allowing private companies to do without the formality of AGMs and making it easier for shareholder decisions to be taken by way of written resolutions instead of meetings. It will also enable private companies to reduce their share capital without the need for court approval. On the latter point, the Government may be wise to respond to the Law Society&#039;s point that that power may be undermined by requiring a reduction in capital&#151;which is, after all, a key step in a merger between companies&#151;to be dependent on the formality of requiring documentation. The Law Society also reasonably queries whether the deregulation of private companies is being taken far enough by the Bill and asks whether the Government intend to deregulate the payment of dividends by private companies, as it has, apparently, contemplated doing. Will the Minister comment on the Government&#039;s intentions on that?
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I am a former non-executive director of various trading companies, particularly in banking and the media. As such, I was conscious of, and properly instructed by company secretaries about, the manifold legal obligations and duties of a director. In so far as the Bill clarifies the duties of a director, I naturally welcome the greater clarity that is the aim of Part 10 of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_206"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Bill. I do not know if the Law Society&#039;s pessimism about whether Part 10 is likely to achieve the aim of clarity and accessibility is justified. Certainly, I would welcome a statement from the Minister on his view of how far the common law on a director&#039;s duty of care will continue to operate. I do not think I can be the only person who does not find Clause 154(4) easy to interpret.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>As I said, I have been a non-executive director, and I have never been happy with the traditional strict view that non-executive directors basically have the same responsibilities as the managing director, the finance director and the other executive directors. I strongly believe in the value to a company of the outside knowledge and experience that non-executives can bring to the boardroom&#151;the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, took this view, and she has great experience of recruiting non-executive directors&#151;and in their negative value of not being closely tied in to the ethos of the full-time directors and managers.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>As a result of Part 10 of the Bill, is the Minister concerned with the possibility that the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, mentioned, that fewer people will be willing to become non-executive directors in future? Of course I mean useful, valuable non-executive directors. There is the other point of view, that some people take on too many non-executive directors. It sometimes beggars belief that one person can perform diligently and conscientiously all the manifold duties of being a director of numerous companies. That is the other extreme. Yet it would be a pity if new conflict of interest rules or other obligations make the taking of more than one or two directorships at a time near impossible.
</p>

<a name="60111-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I look forward with interest to the Grand Committee discussion on takeovers and mergers. So far as they may have adverse effects on competition, the Enterprise Act 2002 and the substantial lessening of competition test applied by the Office of Fair Trading or the Competition Commission are in place, and are accepted as efficacious. This Bill is concerned with the other aspect of takeovers&#151;the effects on the rights of shareholders. It seeks, as the Minister indicated, to implement the EU directive on takeover bids and to put on a statutory basis the rules which protect minority shareholders and other rules which have been governed in the UK since 1968 by the self-regulatory code on takeovers and mergers. I am with the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, when he says that there is probably considerable regret at the passing of a successful and much-praised self-regulatory system. Yet the Government deserve praise for seeking to preserve as much of the old system as possible, and in particular&#151;an important point&#151;to deter parties from tactical and abusive use of litigation to hold up, postpone and delay takeover situations, the effect of which may be desirable. I understand that Article 4(6) of the directive is key to a continuation of the UK principle established by our courts in the 1987 Datafin case, where courts may refuse to hear legal proceedings relating to a bid and obviously designed to hold up and delay what is happening.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60111-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>This is not the first time the Government has helpfully sought to preserve the essentials of an effective UK self-regulatory system when having to put it within a statutory framework to comply with EU obligations. Misleading advertising is a field I know well, and the subtlety but effectiveness of the UK approach to implementation of an EU directive has proved fair, practical and effective. In our debates in Grand Committee on Part 22, I look forward to hearing the Government expound their proposals to continue the autonomy and effective and fair working of the City takeover panel.

<a name="60111-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Freeman: </b>   My Lords, it is a pleasure to welcome my noble friend Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone to these Benches. I share the widely held view among her ministerial and Cabinet colleagues, of which I was one, that whenever the noble Baroness spoke, as a Member of Parliament or Minister, people listened. It was not just the clarity with which she spoke&#151;as again exemplified today&#151;but also the clarity of her thought. It is a pleasure to welcome the noble Baroness; she will make many contributions of great value to your Lordships&#039; proceedings.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I declare several interests as registered, as a director of a number of companies both public and private, listed and unlisted, and commercial and charitable. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, says about Part 10. Before following his train of thought, I strongly agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, on Part 31. He is absolutely right; this section has to be deleted from the Bill. It is unparliamentary. It is a parliamentary outrage&#151;and I am not normally used to intemperate language in your Lordships&#039; House. The noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, is in his place and I am sure that your Lordships will want to study the Delegated Powers Committee report. I sense that the argument is that we do not want to waste time coming back with another Bill, so why not have a super-statutory instrument mechanism to amend company law when it becomes necessary. That is unparliamentary. It is one thing to have a statutory instrument to change a particular part of a Bill, it is another to introduce major new sections of a Bill. I hope the Government will think again on this. It is a rare to get a recommendation from the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, which says, &quot;Strike it out&quot; and gives such clear and bold recommendations. I hope your Lordships will agree with the committee&#039;s recommendations.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I want briefly to raise some points that have not already been raised on Part 10, because I agree with what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. I am delighted that both parties on this side of the House seem to be of one mind on the subject. I hope the Minister&#151;the great Stakhanovite of the Government Benches when it comes to Committee&#151;will listen to reasoned arguments. We should not be fighting each other from trenches; I hope that reason will prevail. Consultation outside this House is one thing, parliamentary process is another. Detailed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_208"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consideration should be given in this House. Although the Minister is not guilty of this, sometimes one has the impression that Bills are presented on the basis of &quot;take it or leave it&quot; because they have been widely consulted upon. That is not a parliamentary process, and I know the Minister will listen carefully to arguments.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>We ought to reflect in Committee whether the codification route&#151;that is, putting on a statutory basis many requirements on directors that are contained in common law, in case law&#151;is the right way to proceed. I am not wholly convinced because there are a number of problems we need to think through. First, there is the lack of flexibility, which is obvious. Judges can interpret case law bearing in mind the facts of a particular case. Once it is in statute, that flexibility is much reduced. The Bill itself is already a tiny bit confused because it cross-refers to case law without defining what that case law is. Of course, we are going to get new case law overlaid on statute. As the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, said in his contribution, fresh legislation will follow. It is a minefield.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>There has been some thought in the department, I understand, about issuing a guide, not only because this Bill is not comprehensive and does not deal with insolvency legislation, but also, as my noble friend Lord Hodgson reminded us in his excellent speech, several parts of company law have been left out and are extant. We must think about issuance of a guide most carefully, because a guide issued by the department, even were it consulted on with the professional bodies, could be more of a complication than simply reliance on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>My concerns about Chapter 2, particularly Clauses 156, 157 and 159, have been well spelt-out. I briefly point my finger at three or four key issues which the Committee has to consider carefully. The change of the wording from &quot;responsibilities of directors to the company&quot; to &quot;members as a whole&quot; will bear careful consideration as to the implications. The new duties in Clause 156(3) beyond the duty to the company, which means the shareholders, is a bold&#151;I think somewhat dangerous&#151;departure. We have to look at the implications of that, and whether they in anyway cloud the paramount duty of a director to look after the interests of the shareholders. I agree with the Minister that directors fall down in their duty if they just look at short-term considerations and issues. The Minister must be right there, but to codify, in the way this Bill does, is dangerous.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>There are other issues. What does the phrase &quot;independent judgment&quot; mean for a director, for instance? How do you avoid a future conflict of interest that cannot be identified at present? Something may arise in future that a director cannot contemplate or specify and therefore avoid.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>We need to consider the Bill carefully in Committee. My noble friends Lady Bottomley and Lord Hodgson were absolutely right that the Bill must pass two clear tests, but I am not convinced that Part 10 passes them. First, will it prevent the registration of more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_209"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

companies? Will it to any significant degree encourage companies to register elsewhere in the European Union or the world? Will it discourage non-executive or executive directors from coming forward for both large and small companies? One thinks of the public interest companies, the charitable companies, the small private companies. The evidence so far is that there is concern. We may be able to allay that concern, but it must be dealt with.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>In conclusion, I am always baffled by regulatory impact assessments and how they are calculated. There is reference to maximum possible benefits of &#163;105 million per annum from the provisions of Part 10. I have tried to understand where that calculation comes from. I think that it was the estimate of a few years ago that 150,000 private companies would each save &#163;700 per annum in not having to take legal advice on the implications of company law&#151;perhaps I simplify. I simply do not believe it. I think that we are talking about &#163;105 million of costs, not benefits. There must be some way of obtaining a more detailed explanation of how that is calculated and, perhaps, of auditing the figure in future.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>In the interests of time, I conclude by welcoming the Bill in principle and looking forward very much indeed to a reasoned Committee debate.

<a name="60111-13_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Tonge: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may be the first from these Benches to welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone, to the House and congratulate her on her maiden speech. It is good to see her here.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I rise with a certain amount of trepidation. I was brought up in a professional family and was taught early on that most business is dodgy and big business is probably evil. Needless to say, I have no interests to declare&#151;I must say that before I go on. When I became international development spokesman for my party in another place, the feelings that I had been brought up with were quickly reinforced by bombardment from non-governmental organisations telling me of the misdeeds of multinational companies, some of them British, in developing countries.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>However, I soon began to realise that big business in Britain in the 19th century led to our social advance and better education and healthcare. It was big business that did that for our country. Likewise, in developing countries, it should be big business&#151;multinational companies, our own big companies, whatever we like to call them&#151;that is the engine for development. It is that issue that I wish to address.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>Large companies are already realising that they must behave in a sustainable way and that it is ultimately in their interest to protect the environment and improve the lives of the workforce. In recent years, an enormous amount of leaflets and brochures, have come from big companies telling us of their social responsibility and how they have left the environment exactly as it was before they started their excavations, or whatever. So things are happening, but far too slowly.

</p>

<a name="60111-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The Prime Minister, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development way back in 2002, said that we must actively promote corporate responsibility and accountability through, among other means, appropriate national regulations. As my noble friend Lord Sharman and others have mentioned, why, then, have the Government taken a backward step by abolishing the requirement for companies to produce an Operating and Financial Review? That would have gone a long way to ensure transparency and accountability among UK companies. As my noble friend said, they are already preparing those reviews.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Instead, the Bill places too much reliance on the concept of &quot;enlightened shareholder value&quot;, which is a trifle vague, to put it mildly. Presumably, it puts the onus on shareholders to turn up to every meeting and grill directors on the sustainability of their operations and whether they are protecting workers and the environment. Unless we all become ethical consumers and every shareholder behaves like my noble friend Lord Avebury, who is renowned for owning one share and turning up to shareholder meetings to make a stink on one issue or another&#151;and we will not, of course&#151;change will be very slow.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has laid down very good ethical guidelines on how companies should behave. The World Bank has also declared that voluntary standards do not work. The regulator for our companies should be our Government and the rules of practice should be written in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I confess that I know little about business except that it must be competitive and must not have too much red tape, but I am reliably informed that there are countries with high levels of business regulation, such as Denmark, Sweden and Finland, which are doing very nicely thank you and are very competitive indeed.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I will mention a brief case study. Some time ago, I watched a brilliant documentary film called &quot;Mangetout&quot;. It was about the activities of a supermarket chain in this country. Before the Minister pales, I will add that it was Tesco. It was growing mangetout for consumption in this country. We saw the wonderful conditions in which the workers work and the wonderful uniforms that they had. We saw wonderful footage of mainly women walking up and down the rows of mangetout plants singing, and I translate:

<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>That was repeated over and over as they went happily to their work to bring us the mangetout that we so crave.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I have very sad news: there has been a recent report that that idyll no longer exists. In South Africa, where that company has pushed down prices paid to the farmers and demanded tougher conditions, the rights of thousands of fruit pickers have been eroded. Women workers report dangerous exposure to pesticides, no protective clothing and poverty wages for long, long hours of work. Yet, in April 2005, Tesco <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_211"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 211</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

announced record annual profits of &#163;2 billion. That company is a good one. It has created voluntary codes of conduct for its fruit suppliers, focusing on technical issues such as pesticide spraying. It supports the Ethical Trading Initiative on Minimum Labour Standards. It is committed to social responsibility. Despite all that, we have this terrible report of the abuse of workers in South Africa.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>The voluntary approach does not work. It needs underpinning by minimum legal standards applied at national and international level. The Bill must be used to do that for our companies. We must not miss the opportunity.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Amendments would be welcome in the following areas. I leave it to my very experienced colleagues to work out the detail, but there must be a positive duty on directors of companies to minimise any negative impact due to their operations in other countries. It must be extended to national and foreign associate companies and subsidiaries. The reporting requirements on social and environmental impact must be strengthened in the business review. It cannot be just financial matters that are reported on. When all else fails, there must be protection under UK law for affected communities abroad so that they can seek compensation for any human rights or environmental abuses committed by our companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Our large companies&#151;all multinational companies&#151;have huge power and resources and can be the engine for development all over the world. Let us ensure in the Bill that the operations of our companies are sustainable and responsible.

<a name="60111-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a non-executive director and a charity trustee of the kind so thoughtfully referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, in her remarkably telling maiden speech. As the noble Baroness emphasised, governance and regulation should indeed be about effectiveness, and the UK obviously needs a thriving, effective private sector as the basis for our future economic, cultural and social wellbeing. But governance should also be about responsibility. In this context, the intention and drive behind the Bill are to be welcomed.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Two-thirds of world trade is undertaken by multinational corporations. They have a very significant influence on the social, human and environmental experiences and rights of many millions of people both in the developed and developing countries. The Bill will inevitably be judged by many by the degree to which it successfully addresses the power and responsibility of UK companies operating in the global economy, the impact on employees, communities and the environment, not only here in the United Kingdom but, at least as importantly, overseas as well.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The Bill underlines the primary duty of directors to deliver financial benefits to shareholders. In Clause 156 it also spells out clearly that, in discharging their duties, directors should have regard to the interests of their employees and the impact of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_212"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 212</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

company&#039;s activities on the community and environment. However, it does not seem to spell out equally clearly what directors must do when their social duties conflict with the primary duty to promote the company for the benefit of its members.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The Government have an enviable reputation in their tangible commitment to the poor of the world. The work of DfID is exemplary and the Chancellor has been a powerful pace-setter with his personal conviction. The Government have also declared their intention to give priority to the challenges of the environment. It would, therefore, be good if my noble friend, when responding to the debate, could clarify precisely what is the policy of the Government towards any potential conflict of interest on the part of directors in these spheres.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>My noble friend has stressed that the Government have settled for what is called &quot;enlightened shareholder value&quot;. This assumes that good social and environmental practices are always compatible with&#151;and, indeed, good for&#151;profitability. This is a good philosophy. I subscribe to it. Unfortunately, it is not yet widely enough reflected or understood in the real world, where short-term opportunism is too often the order of the day. As Friends of the Earth, ActionAid, Oxfam, Christian Aid, Amnesty International and others, with all their front line expertise, have argued, there are altogether too many indications that the voluntary approach is not working. As the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, reminded us, this has been acknowledged both by the World Bank and OECD.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>There are three specific issues on which the reassurance of my noble friend would be encouraging. First, is it not possible to insist in the Bill that, rather than just having regard to the impact on workers, communities and the environment, directors should have a positive duty to take reasonable steps to minimise negative impacts? Should this duty not also extend to the operation of foreign associates, subsidiaries and sub-contractors of UK companies?
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Secondly, just why was the Operating and Financial Review abolished? It was on course to ensure improvements in the quality and transparency of company reporting to stakeholders. Can the reporting requirements of OFR really not be incorporated into the provisions of its successor, the Business Review? This would mean that all UK companies would be required to disclose information on their environmental and social impacts alongside their annual financial reports.

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Thirdly, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, has argued, in their imaginative approach to global justice, do the Government not believe that it is essential that there should be some protection under UK law for affected communities abroad so that they are able to seek compensation for human rights and environmental abuses resulting from the activities of UK companies, their overseas subsidiaries, associates and sub-contractors? Is this not fundamental to a commitment to justice? If this Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for such protection, what other arrangements do the Government favour? This really is no longer a matter that can be left in the air.

<a name="60111-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Let me take just one illustration. Since the 1980s, in the Niger Delta in Nigeria, to say the least, it is clear that there is room for considerable concern about the gap between the published corporate responsibility policies and ethos of major companies and their continuing direct and indirect performance on the ground. Some of the disturbing issues from this part of Africa are still caught up in legal proceedings, but at this stage it can be said that despite the finding of the Federal High Court of Nigeria last November that gas flaring violates guaranteed constitutional rights to life and dignity and that it must stop, the gas flaring, with all its waste, environmental damage, deafening noise, severely adverse health consequences and pollution for the communities in the vicinity of where it happens, continues. Elsewhere in Nigeria, failure to replace aging pipeline infrastructure has led to repeated oil spills and associated environmental destruction, including the pollution of water supplies and the loss of mangroves, fish ponds and aquatic life.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>In contrast to the declared and increasingly vaunted policies on social and environmental matters of the companies concerned, both British and foreign, the realities are those that I have just described when it comes to what is happening on the ground. A sad situation becomes still more ominous with the reports of harassment of communities which may be in the path of business projects in places such as Oganiland.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Enhancing the duty of directors as set down in the Bill to include a duty of care towards communities and environments is an urgent necessity. I cannot believe that my noble friend would not agree. I hope that he will make this clear when he winds up today. I cannot believe that those in companies such as Shell, who have produced their impressive policy texts on corporate social responsibility in these matters, would not welcome such a provision in helping to turn rhetoric and intellectual conviction into front-line action.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>We need a healthy, vigorous private sector. We also seek a sustainable, stable, secure and safer world. Environmental threats are the biggest single danger facing humanity. They are also central to more immediate issues of political stability. Extremism and terrorism, which so pre-occupy us, breed on alienation, deprivation, suffering, exclusion and injustice. It is no exaggeration to say that in this Bill we have an ideal opportunity to make a positive, imaginative and muscular contribution to the sustainable, safer world we all seek. It would be sad were we in an otherwise highly commendable Bill to miss that opportunity.

<a name="60111-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Patten: </b>   My Lords, while I was very sorry to miss the opening passages of the Minister&#039;s speech&#151;for which I apologise&#151;I know that we will have many more opportunities in the coming weeks and months to hear his tones as the Bill unfolds.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>My noble friend Lord Freeman rightly referred to the Minister as using Stakhanovite endeavours to get so much legislation through the House. I believe that a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_214"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

subsequent scholarship by historians of the Soviet era proves that Stakhanov never existed except as a figment of the propagandists&#039; ideas of productivity. So, in future, I shall delete the word &quot;Stakhanovite&quot; and think &quot;Sainsburyite.&quot; In what I have to say I must declare all my interests as a non-executive director, as set out in our Register of Interests. I think it is proper on this occasion, as I intend to speak solely about directors&#039; duties, that I also declare the interests of my wife, who as non-executive chairman of Brixton plc and a non-executive director of Great Universal Stores plc, Bradford and Bingley plc and, from 1 February, Marks and Spencer plc, is, as your Lordships will realise, a far more distinguished company director than I could ever assume to be. I assure your Lordships that in the Patten household we operate a &quot;Chinese duvet&quot; policy on corporate matters.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I have three reflections and one main point to make. The first is to say that the Bill rekindles the question I have often asked in this place: just what is the DTI for? In this period of the &quot;Bonfire of the Ideologies,&quot; as we are told by leaders and would-be leaders of the three main parties, perhaps one of the first pieces of tri-partisan agreement can be dispensing with the services of the DTI. I realise that declarations in Explanatory Notes, or for that matter in the preamble to a Bill such as this, have no statutory weight, but when made they set the tone. There is no specific mention or reference in either to the importance of the corporate sector or of corporate enterprise. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred to the importance of corporate enterprise in his remarks on ethical and environmental matters, with which I largely agreed, although I do not think he has fully recognised all the efforts made on these fronts by UK corporates in recent years. In particular, I wonder whether the Minister&#039;s colleagues in the Treasury have fully grasped the extra regulatory burdens placed on the corporate sector by this Bill, and that the health of this sector, with its critical revenue raising capabilities, may be inhibited.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>My second reflection is that we do need, of course, to ensure the responsible business behaviour of companies in this country. I hope that will always characterise the activities of modern British business. I do not believe that trying to do this purely by regulation and legislation is the best route. The UK corporate sector has, with very few exceptions, in recent decades compared wonderfully to those of the United States, France, Germany and, in particular, Italy, given their multiple scandals. I think it has performed in an exemplary way and the environmental record of UK corporates has, I believe, been exceptionally good compared to worldwide standards. That is something my party rightly takes very seriously.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>My third reflection, as I intend to concentrate solely on the provisions of this Bill relating to directors&#039; duties, is that running a company is difficult. I think there should be recognition of that fact. It is challenging; it calls for judgment of what is best and the balancing of competing&#151;sometimes unendurably competing&#151;pressures in order to find the right way <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_215"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 215</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

forward. In many ways exactly the same challenges that face Ministers, face directors in the boardroom. So I do not think that the introduction of a new statutory code for directors in this respect is wise. I admire, as the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, I think said in his earlier speech, the consistently well argued opposition of the Law Society to some of the provisions in Part 10 of the Bill. The statutory code approach is, I think, inflexible, confusing, likely to lead to increased bureaucracy, to load more cost on to companies and will soon date. It is not too late for the Government to think again, even at this late stage, and to substitute a voluntary code structure for the statutory code proposed.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>That is enough reflection. I would now like to turn to my main point. This concerns the innocent-sounding duty of company directors&#151;executive and non-executive alike, these being the same in law&#151;to &quot;promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members.&quot; I as yet have no idea what the word &quot;success&quot; means in this context. I hope the Minister can help us on this point in his winding-up, as he might also by defining the word &quot;members.&quot; This is no Committee stage point; it goes right to the very heart of the Bill. Indeed, the Minister raised it in his opening speech. An extremely suspicious interpretation of these provisions&#151;and far be it from me ever to fall into being in any way a suspicious or extreme person&#151;would be that these duties are some brand spanking new insertion, little by little, under the radar screen, of the widest possible interpretation of stakeholder duties or stakeholder interests, so-called, into boardroom decisions. The very word &quot;stakeholders&quot; can very soon mutate into &quot;the whole population of the country.&quot;
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>At present, the concept of the company as an entity in whose interests directors must act is well understood. The purposes of the new statutory code are, as I have said, unclear, and will, I think, add regulatory burdens and costs rather than savings. In the face of the uncertainties the Bill introduces, I think directors will have to look very hard at the threat that the courts may intervene. There are objective tests on the face of the Bill which would, I think, at best encourage and, at worst, sometimes require the courts to intervene in matters previously and properly left to the directors and board. Their business judgment&#151;and that is what the men and women who staff our boardrooms are called on to deploy, day in and day out&#151;may well be inhibited. Suppose a company for sound business reasons decides to reduce its workforce. That could put it at odds with its &quot;members&#039;&quot; interests, when we find out what &quot;members&quot; actually means. What about the position of joint-venture companies? I think this requires a lot of forensic examination?
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Perhaps more pointedly, where does the Bill leave directors? Some of my noble friends and some noble Lords on the other side of the House may have been in the position of facing a hostile takeover bid or of putting themselves on to the market and the company being in receipt of competing bids. Under present practice it is possible to decide not to accept the highest bid if this is judged not to be in the interests of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_216"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

company as a separate entity. The likely circumstances are too well-known to bear elaboration, but to take just one example, a bidder might make a highly leveraged bid, which could lead, in the sitting directors&#039; views, to levels of debt that could not reasonably be serviced by the present cash flow or future earnings, thereby threatening to diminish pension benefits or to make the sale of assets necessary.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>All this uncertainty will certainly lead to two things; out of uncertainty will come certainty. First, it will lead to increased corporate costs, as levels of directors&#039; and officers&#039; insurance are bound to shoot up as directors look, quite properly, to dealing with the sort of threats&#151;referred to by my noble friend Lady Bottomley&#151;non-executive directors are so unfairly attacked by. Secondly, and I must choose my words carefully, because there are one or two people present who have worked with professional services firms in the past, I think there will be a whole new and highly profitable advisory industry as professional services firms and consultancies gear up to advise boards on their new frightening responsibilities, with all the slowing down of decision-taking and unnecessary box-ticking that will entail. There will be a lot of new business in the offing for professional service companies and consultancies.
</p>

<a name="60111-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I should like to end on this note: exactly what is the nuisance that the statutory code is trying to deal with? Perhaps the Minister, in his normal Stakhanovite&#151;or now &quot;Sainsburyite&quot;&#151;way can give us an example of the type of nuisance that will be dealt with by this statutory code. How, in a period when we are entering a new phase of slow growth in the United Kingdom, no better than the European average and with a growing deficit, are the sort of increasing burdens and costs that are being placed on business going to help the corporate sector to do the sort of things that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, in his speech was seeking for them to do?

<a name="60111-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Murphy: </b>   My Lords, I should say at the outset that I do not include myself in that galaxy of talents in company law reform to which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, referred earlier. Indeed, as a psychiatrist, I do not know if I can offer my services to the Minister only to shrink the Bill in some way. I want to speak as a member of the UK Shareholders&#039; Association; I should say at the outset that I am a close relative of one of the directors of that association and have read their views on this Bill with interest.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>I want to speak to a point already raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, about Part 9 from the point of view of those 10 million or so people in the UK who have put their precious savings into PEPs and ISAs, boldly joining the new shareholding democracy, without realising&#151;and I include myself in this&#151;that they enjoy none of the rights of ordinary registered shareholders. The use of nominee accounts for these types of investments has effectively disenfranchised investors. I contrast this with the hold style of small personal investments 25 years ago, when a nest egg bought a handful of shares in a blue-chip company or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_217"></a>

one&#039;s favourite retailer, and then you had the fun every morning of watching your stocks go up and down. If you wished, you could go to the AGM and, with a bit of luck, you got a free lunch. Now, though, no less than 40 per cent of all shareholdings in this country are held in nominee accounts. That is a staggeringly high percentage of holdings, and people have no say in what happens to those investments.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>In the Bill the Government acknowledge the desirability of nominee account shareholders being properly informed about their investments and support them being able to participate in company meetings, request and vote on resolutions, and so on. But, in practice, the Bill is unlikely to make any substantial difference to the majority of those account holders.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>First, the Bill is enabling, not obligatory. It relies on the support of companies to change their articles to support enfranchisement of nominee shareholders, but it is clear that companies probably will not want either the hassle of change or the cost of implementing these rights, even though, as the Minister said, costs may go down substantially if &#163;250 million a year is saved through other parts of the Bill. Although the Bill provides reserve powers in Clause 137 to enable the Secretary of State to compel companies to provide information, there are no powers to compel companies to involve shareholders in company business. It is not clear under what circumstances these reserve powers would be used, nor how the intermediate tier of stockbrokers and financial advisers will be persuaded to collaborate with such a system. If the intermediate purchasers and operators do not want to provide the information, then, with the best will in the world, a voluntary system will not work.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Companies will differ in their decisions about nominee shareholder enfranchisement; information to the shareholders will often be varied and confusing. Can the Minister outline how there could be more clarity and a bolder structure in the shareholders&#039; interests, to which I believe the Government have committed themselves?
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Of course, many shareholders will have no desire to immerse themselves in the detail and should not be burdened with information if they do not want to be. But if they do, their rights should be there on request. The USA is able to provide such a system of shareholder enfranchisement in these cases, through use of a third single party account, and I see no reason why we cannot do this. Perhaps the Minister can explain why.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Part 8 sets out the public nature of a company&#039;s register and a company&#039;s right to apply to a court to refuse access to the register if it believes that access is not for a proper purpose. What exactly might &quot;not proper&quot; include? There is a concern that it might include denying access to the register of a person critical of the board&#039;s decision-making who wants to advertise his criticisms to others on the register. Or is that not the case?

<a name="60111-15_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for introducing the debate. The Bill represents the culmination of seven years&#039; work, and we welcome its introduction to your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I join other noble Lords in congratulating my noble friend Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone on her most interesting and constructive maiden speech. We are fortunate indeed to have her among us in your Lordships&#039; House and I look forward to her future contributions, from which we will all greatly benefit.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I would have preferred the Bill to have been called the companies Bill, and have eventually become the Companies Act 2006, in that it amends and restates much of the Companies Act 1985. After all, do not most Bills reform something? I tend to agree with my noble friend Lord Hodgson and the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, that it might have been better to have had one new consolidated Companies Act.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>There is much in the Bill that is welcomed by business practitioners. The provisions to make it easier to set up and run a company will be appreciated by proprietors of SMEs which account for the vast majority of British businesses. However, I was particularly struck by one point made in the excellent speech of my noble friend Lady Bottomley. She regretted the abolition of the requirement to maintain a company secretary. I wholly agree with her and cannot believe that this will help any company, small or large. After all, somebody will still have to do the company secretary&#039;s job, and it is better to be clear who that person is.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I will not repeat all the excellent points that other noble Lords have made, but I would like to mention a small number of areas where I believe the Bill can be improved. I strongly agree with the United Kingdom Shareholders&#039; Association that incurring substantial start-up costs in preparation to trade under a particular name should not be a sufficient ground to lay aside the objection of an existing user of an identical or substantially similar name. After all, in the age of the Internet, it is much easier to check in advance whether a particular business name is in use.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I also agree with UKSA that the grounds on which a court may properly refuse a request from a non-shareholder for a copy of the shareholders&#039; register should be included in Clause 116. In the case of a publicly traded company, it is not difficult in any event to become a shareholder, and it is not easy for a company to prevent improper use of its own shareholders&#039; register by a person who has purchased a few shares purely to obtain the register. Would it not be simpler and easier to make a distinction here <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_219"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 219</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

between public and private companies? Private companies should arguably not be compelled to disclose their shareholders&#039; register to non-members, whereas there is surely an argument that the shareholders&#039; register of a public company should be in the public domain in any event.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, correctly stated, there is a widespread feeling that the Bill&#039;s provisions on beneficial shareholder enfranchisement do not go far enough. I agree that indirect shareholders who wish to participate actively in the governance of all the companies in which they invest should be given the legal right to do so. It may be true that the vast majority of holders of unit trusts and investors in collective investment schemes will not want to be bothered with the huge amount of bureaucracy inevitably involved. Most of them will be content to cede their voting rights as shareholders to the fund manager concerned. Perhaps purchasers of unit trusts and the like could be asked whether they wish to opt in or opt out of their right to be involved in corporate democracy at the point of sale.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>If fund managers are to be compelled to procure the distribution in hard copy of annual and interim reports to all indirect shareholders, irrespective of whether they wish to receive them, I guarantee that more than 90 per cent of such voluminous material will end up in the dustbin unread. That is likely even in the case of companies which have opted to provide summary financial statements under Clause 402. Nevertheless, the rights of those beneficial shareholders who wish to participate must be respected.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>I am attracted by the Canadian system, whereby custodians invite beneficial shareholders to opt into the governance and information systems. Beneficial shareholders who have opted out will be asked every year whether they still wish to opt out and, whether they have or have not, they are in any case required to be notified of matters concerning extraordinary general meetings. I think it is clearly wrong to leave the question of whether and to what extent indirect shareholders are enfranchised to the discretion of individual companies. The Government&#039;s proposals to do with that issue are woefully inadequate, in spite of the sensible position that had been adopted in the White Paper.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I should declare my interests, as disclosed in the Register of Interests, as a director of a number of companies and as chairman of the board of trustees of a charity. I am also concerned that the extension of the duties of directors will not do anything to encourage more well qualified individuals to take on non-executive directorships. The provisions of Clause 156 are likely to lead to an increase in lawsuits against directors by those who think, for example, that a particular company&#039;s operations do not at all times and in all respects have a wholly beneficial impact on the community and the environment. I think it is wholly superfluous to write into law a requirement that a director must have regard to the need to foster the company&#039;s business relationships with suppliers, customers and others.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_220"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 220</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>That type of thing is common sense, as is the desirability of a company to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct. My noble friend Lord Patten made some very sensible comments on this clause. Surely the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants is correct in its opinion that it would be unrealistic to expect directors in any set of given circumstances to adopt positive stances in respect of all prescribed factors at the same time and that the ultimate arbiter of whether directors have made wise decisions should be the company members themselves. The section on derivative claims and actions by members is not clear enough and the inclusion of this concept in the Bill is likely to encourage US-style class actions in the UK.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Clause 862 gives the Financial Services Authority power to make rules concerning community obligations on corporate governance for issuers on a regulated market. Is the CBI not right in its submission that it is not appropriate to widen the FSA&#039;s powers in this direction? This is another reason why it is unwise to muddy the waters concerning directors&#039; clear responsibilities to shareholders with too much codification of responsibilities to the community and to other stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Some of the language in the Bill strikes me as odd. &quot;Oversea companies&quot;, covered in Part 25, is a case in point. It sounds strange. Why can we not have &quot;overseas companies&quot;, especially as Clause 126 in Part 8 allows us &quot;overseas branch registers&quot;?
</p>

<a name="60111-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Lastly, I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and my noble friend Lord Freeman, who so eloquently explained that Part 31, which gives the Secretary of State the powers to change anything in the Bill through secondary legislation, should be removed. Companies need certainty and stability. If the Act can be altered at will&#151;substantially altered&#151;there seems to be little point in your Lordships&#039; working to improve the Bill to give British and foreign companies the stable legal framework that they need to continue to run profitable businesses and to provide productive employment. For this and for all the other powerful reasons put forward by the noble Viscount and by my noble friend, I earnestly hope that the Government will think again on this point. In principle, there is much that is good in this Bill, but I hope that when it leaves your Lordships&#039; House, it will be a Bill of which we can all be proud. It has been a privilege to speak in this debate and I look forward to the speeches of other noble Lords.

It becomes more sexy if one follows the Herculean efforts undertaken by the Company Law Review Group, which was to look at it not only as a dry commercial subject, but as one that governs relationships of many stakeholders and as part of social law.

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I leave aside consolidation in the hope that someone&#151;I hope a young man&#151;in the vast labyrinth of Whitehall is already writing the first clause of a consolidation measure for 2012, in which he will put together a single thread&#151;that is important&#151;of company law, takeover law and financial services.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Of course, as its great novelty, the Bill takes up the maxim of the Company Law Review, &quot;Think small first&quot;. The trouble is&#151;if I can put in a phrase and leave out a page&#151;that the Bill does not &quot;think small first&quot; in its deregulation of formalities, AGMs and so on, but it &quot;thinks private company first&quot; and the two are not the same, as every practitioner in company law will understand. &quot;Think private company&quot; is a very different proposition from &quot;think small&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>It is also important to notice what the Bill would do with the basis of our company law. Every company law system imposes a price for two necessary privileges, which are incorporation by registration of the company as a separate legal person and, secondly, as we have had since 1855, the privilege of limited liability for the members. The Bill actually adds a new area of immunity for the Takeover Panel as regards its address of the rule of law, but that is a footnote. The price that we have always insisted on at the core of our system is, first, adequate, appropriate disclosure of a company&#039;s affairs and, secondly, protection of investors and the public against fraud. In company law, &quot;fraud&quot; does not mean merely crude misrepresentation or deceit; it means a sustenance of those fiduciary duties and principles of which the great American Chief Justice Cardozo once said that the important thing was that they were &quot;somewhat higher than those of the marketplace&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>The claims that the fiduciary duties have recently been tightened in the courts are, in my submission, erroneous. They were a kind of allergy brought on by severe attacks of what has been called City-equitable-itis. There is no tightening of the fiduciary duties and it is important that the passage of the Bill is not an occasion on which they are developed. I say that about only Part 10, which has been much discussed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_222"></a>

</p>

<a name="60111-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>The clauses in Part 10 of the Bill are a brave effort clearly to set out the basic fiduciary duties in statute. The fact that people do not realise that they were already there in cases, in slightly different language on occasion, does not alter my view. Nor do I think that the clauses on the derivative action are other than a brave and clear effort to set out something that is in our law already. I may be too influenced by having spent many years with the rule in <i>Foss</i> v <i>Harbottle</i>, but my studies in this area lead me to believe that these two parts of the Bill are an excellent effort, albeit they will be examined closely in Committee. Unhappily, Committee will be in that quiet legislative graveyard of the Grand Committee from which one can play truant only if the pressures of important matters in the Chamber force one to leave it. It is a pity that the Committee is not taking place in the Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The most important clauses&#151;as has been pointed out&#151;are those that centre on the basic duty of directors to act in the interests of the company. To summarise my view, there are not the difficulties that people have been putting forward on Clauses 154 and 156 and that part of the Bill. There is a requirement that directors act in what the Company Law Review called,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;an enlightened attitude to shareholders&#039; interests&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Curiously, that is similar to what the CBI said in 1973 when it reported that a company, particularly a public company should act as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;a good corporate citizen in business&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>However, the clauses on corporate governance are important for another reason and I make two final points on that. First, simply analytically, executive directors have come to occupy a new social stratum&#151;a new position&#151;not just in Britain but around the world. Recent research has disclosed very clearly that that has little or nothing to do with the so-called global competition for good executives. Of course, the development is at its most objectionable when it takes the form of very high rewards for business failure. Marconi was only one example&#151;there are many others&#151;about which noble Lords can read in the Library where I have deposited a publication dealing with these matters.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Quite apart from failure, the House must understand that, in the past two decades, the takings&#151;or what American colleagues call rent extraction&#151;from corporations by executive directors have risen exponentially. They have risen, are rising and should be restrained. The Government must also understand that the three orthodox remedies for that&#151;greater disclosure, supervision by institutional directors or supervision and monitoring by an expanded pool of post-Higgs non-executives&#151;have all shown signs of failure. At the very least, my noble friend will surely amend the Bill to make the shareholders&#039; resolution on directors&#039; remuneration, in which we include salaries, share options, incentive plans and what one professor in the 1980s called an exceptionally diverse and expensive perquisite of large scope and ingenuity. Surely the shareholders&#039; view on that coming from the remuneration committee should be made final.

</p>

<a name="60111-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>There is a further reason to believe that the Bill should at least include some procedural measures to deal with this social question. Brendan Barber of the TUC recently said that directors,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;have continued to build up enormous VIP pensions, while they tighten everyone&#039;s belts except their own . . . [They] already get huge salaries and they should be in the same pension scheme as their staff&quot;.</p>

<p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Well, I do not know about that, but certainly riches overflow in corporate pension pots while ordinary folk fear, after a lifetime of toil, for their old age in their company pension schemes. I have various examples of that, but time does not allow me to describe them although it would astonish some of your Lordships who I find are not quite &quot;with it&quot; in knowing how far this has gone.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Similarly, I must leave aside Part 31, although I accept that we should take a close look at it because it seems, as has been said by your Lordships&#039; committees, to go beyond the normal rules of legislation. Subject to all that, I welcome the Bill, which has a vast number of sensible and practical proposals.

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="60111-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Goudie: </b>   My Lords, I welcome the Bill. I welcome its three objectives set out in the Explanatory Notes: first; to provide a simple, efficient and cost-effective framework for British business in the 21st century; secondly, to adopt principles that are simple and as accessible as both possible for companies and their advisers; and thirdly, to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>However, I do not believe that the Bill as currently drafted fully achieves those admirable objectives. In particular, it does not entirely avoid imposing unnecessary burdens on companies and their advisers. I have in mind the position of auditors. In that connection, I declare an interest: I provide consultancy services to Deloitte.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>This is necessarily a large Bill. This is a Second Reading debate. At this stage, I shall touch on only a few points. The first relates to something that is not in the Bill. There are no provisions deregulating dividends paid by private companies. There should be a simple provision allowing directors of private companies to declare dividends having taken due account of their duties as directors and the ability of the company to meet its debts over the coming year. These general fiduciary duties form a code of conduct and are set out in Chapter 2 of Part 10 of the Bill. They are sufficient. They derive from common law and equitable principles. They are owned by all directors. They involve the exercise of independent judgment and of reasonable care, skill and diligence.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>The issue is whether more than these general duties is required in relation to the payment of dividends. In the case of public companies, particular dividend rules are required by the European Union Second Company Law directive. However, a quarter of a century ago, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_224"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the United Kingdom chose to go further than that requirement and apply the rules to private companies as well. Whether or not that was right at the time, it is not right in the present circumstances. There have been major changes in accounting recently&#151;in particular, the move to international financial reporting standards last year. The United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, which private companies normally follow, is increasingly based on those standards. The ability of private companies to pay dividends is being increasingly restricted by the changed accounting rules.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>The additional requirements of the directive rules now create a threat to the ability of United Kingdom companies to keep delivering a flow of dividends on which pension schemes and pensioners depend. That is because even large companies are dependent on their private subsidiaries for dividend purposes. The general duties of directors, as set out in the Bill, and a test to meet debts as they fall due over the next 12 months would be adequate. The directive rules should no longer be extended to private companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>I now turn to another topic&#151;Part 11 of the Bill relates to the derivative claims and the actions by a member, the key aspects of which are set out in Clause 239(4). That provides that a derivative claim may be brought by a member in respect of alleged wrongs committed, if at all, prior to his becoming a member. Subsection (3) also extends the concept of derivative claims to persons other than directors. These provisions would attract vulture funds and exploitation by them and their lawyers. It is a recipe for litigation&#151;with companies having to obtain more protective legal advice&#151;and a risk-averse culture, to the detriment of sound management activity and profit. There are also a number of important drafting points appropriate to be raised in Committee, in order to clarify the scope of derivative claims and actions, and to strengthen protection from frivolous and vexatious claims.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>I turn to Part 16, relating to audit, and focus on three aspects: criminal offences in Clauses 494 to 496; auditor resignation in Clauses 503 to 510, and auditors&#039; liability in Clauses 516 to 523. The inclusion of the proposed new criminal offence for auditors&#151;in particular Clause 494(2)(a), which links such an offence to omission of statements relating to proper accounting records&#151;would result in unintended consequences. That will have a detrimental impact on all companies. In order to cover themselves, auditors will spend more time checking accounting records and will be less willing to exercise judgment than at present. They will feel under great pressure to qualify accounts on grounds relating to accounting records, particularly as there is no material threshold there. As a result, business will have to spend more time on keeping records and less on serving their customers and developing innovative products and services.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>In many ways, the impact on the United Kingdom economy might be similar to that of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in the United States, which, as we know, has had a detrimental impact on the whole of that economy. The impact of the auditor offences part <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_225"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the Bill will be most significant for small, entrepreneurial companies which are the growth engine of the economy. There is already a requirement on directors to keep proper accounting records. Given the less formal systems in operation in smaller companies, auditors at present make a judgment about the quality of the accounting records at a point in time. The threat of criminal record will mean that they are much less willing to make similar sorts of judgments in future. As a result, there is a greater chance that auditors will offer qualified opinions in respect of accounting records. The qualification could, in turn, be taken as prima facie evidence that directors had failed to maintain proper accounting records, and lead to their potential prosecution.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The overall impact of the offence&#039;s wording adds unnecessary audit costs to business, creates uncertainty for directors of smaller and medium-sized companies, and diverts efforts away from innovation and customer service in such businesses toward an unnecessary level of systems of accounting and control. It serves the economy poorly and sends out the wrong message to entrepreneurs about the consequences of incorporation under United Kingdom jurisdiction. It may also further reduce choice in the audit market. The threat of criminalising auditors over accounting record qualifications would also cause even more firms to deregister as auditors.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>I fully support the concept of criminalising fraudulent or dishonest behaviour in auditors, but existing legislation in the new Fraud Bill already covers that. In addition, significant deterrents already exist by way of the recently re-established Financial Reporting Council&#151;and their more pro-active Financial Reporting Review Panel, new Accountancy Investigation and Discipline Board and new Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy&#151;to prevent negligence.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>Clauses 495 and 496 enable guidance for prosecuting authorities, but do nothing to control privately brought prosecutions. The audit profession is rightly concerned to avoid mischievous or malicious use of the criminal justice system, particularly to leverage civil action against an auditor. I dispute the need for criminal penalty clauses in the Bill. They are unnecessary, as the offences are effectively legislated for elsewhere, and conflict with the thrust of using regulatory penalties and civil action rather than criminal proceedings to deal with matters. If they are needed, they should be redrafted to avoid unintended consequences. As an absolute minimum, a clear statement is required about the intent behind using the words &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; in the audit context. In particular, assurance is required that honest mistakes do not result in a criminal record.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Again, there are a number of important drafting points to be raised in Committee. The same applies in relation to auditor resignation where the clauses do not seem to follow the lessons that should be learnt from the Jarvis plc and Easier plc cases. The draft <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_226"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clauses would also seem to create some unnecessary bureaucracy in terms of subsidiaries of public companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>Finally, I turn to auditor&#039;s liability: the provisions protecting auditors from liability and liability limitation agreements; their authorisation, effect, duration and termination; and the disclosure of them. Under the Bill, liability limitation agreements, or LLAs, have to be agreed by the company. The auditor has no power to require LLAs. Assuming, however, that there is an LLA in the first place, it is unilaterally terminable by members of the company by ordinary resolution. Moreover, it can be revoked by a court. The effect of the process of obtaining an LLA, the ability of the company to terminate one or of a court to revoke it means that auditors may have no protection whatever regarding their aggregate potential liability to the company. The result: uncertainly for auditors and for companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Further, the wording of the proposed legislation seems to allow only LLAs that set a monetary cap on the auditor&#039;s liability. Those caps are unlikely to be acceptable to investors, who may only consider proportionality&#151;that is, limiting an auditor&#039;s liability to such proportion of a loss as is attributable to culpability, and ignoring the effect of insolvency on other defendants. Therefore, LLAs are unlikely to be achieved in respect of major companies. In the absence of LLAs, auditors will assess their liability exposure and that will lead to increased work and fees; increased numbers of audit qualifications in circumstances where there is no LLA, as a protective measure to avoid risk of claims; and, in some instances, resignation from companies where LLAs are not agreed.
</p>

<a name="60111-16_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I realise that time is running out for me, but this is a good Bill; it can and should be made a better one.

<a name="60111-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </b>   My Lords, company law is central to our prosperity. It is important, therefore, that it is up to date and able to meet the needs of a modern, dynamic economy. As the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, has pointed out, our company law is based on principles largely established in the 19th century; namely, that the right to limited liability brought with it certain responsibilities, and that the advantages should be matched by arrangements for accountability. A thorough overhaul was long overdue to make the law clearer and more accessible. I join with other noble Lords in broadly giving a warm welcome to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I recognise that the choice of the word minimalist to describe a Bill with 885 clauses may seem somewhat bizarre, but the Government have, by and large, followed the principle of preferring codes to over-prescriptive legislation. There are a couple of exceptions, which I hope will be addressed in Committee&#151;for example, directors&#039; responsibilities, which might be handled in another way. By and large, they have not over-legislated here. It is a big Bill because, frankly, company law is a very big subject.

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>As a small side issue, I suggest that the DTI allocates a small promotional budget to export our legislative system on company law abroad and counter the regulatory imperialism of the SEC, which is exporting American methods into Asia, in particular. We start with the huge advantage that Commonwealth countries by and large have company law based on ours. Without being chauvinistic about it, I believe that our system is better than that of the United States, where over-legislation has produced corporate scandals which, by and large, we have avoided.

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>We are more than pulling our weight in Europe in these matters. I attended the European Corporate Governance Conference in London in November, where Commissioner McCreevy said that it was quite clear that Europe has got the message that we need to have a proper balance in the tension between accountability and entrepreneurship. He made the point that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;Despite having an Internal Market of over 450 million, we still make it difficult for companies to exploit this.

</p>

<a name="60111-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>I congratulate the Government as this Bill is a model of how legislation should be introduced. I recognise the, perhaps, legitimate complaint from the Opposition that it took rather too long to produce the Bill; but I should much rather spend more time in preparation than have bad legislation rushed through and then repent it for five years before having another legislative window. The consultation has been extensive; consultation becomes real only when people see draft clauses and realise the effect of them and how they will impact on their businesses. At that point, you get a genuine response, rather than over-general submissions to the government department.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The one exception that I must make is with the OFR clauses. At best, I may say that the Government have handled that matter in a messy way. We in the All-Party Parliamentary Corporate Governance Group commissioned some research into the OFR, and the broad conclusion is that while all the companies thought that the Government had done extremely well in consulting on how the OFR should be implemented, they had not done very well in deciding whether the OFR was necessary. My present feeling is that the Government have got it about right with the business review proposal, but I must admit that they have gone a very long, round-about way in getting there. At the start, the proposals frightened a lot of people because they meant that expressions of opinions about futures would have to be audited. Frankly, auditors are not equipped to second guess the future; they are equipped to measure the past. The Government got away from that and I, along with the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, and others, in this House in March, broadly welcomed the OFR as meeting the needs of business as it then was. We then got a shock when the Chancellor said that they were not going to proceed with it; then we heard that it was not really killed off because the <br>&nbsp;<br>

business review was coming in its place. I believe that we have ended up in the right place, but we could have got there a bit more efficiently.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Thirty years ago we had regional stock markets in this country&#151;we had one in the city of Glasgow. Individuals now own a quarter of the percentage of shares that they owned then. Insurance companies, by contrast, own twice as high a percentage, pension funds three times as much, and foreign investors nearly five times as much. So the relationship between shareholders and companies is radically different from what it was even 15 or 20 years ago. The difficulty is how we mediate trust between essentially remote investors and companies. Even active investors are not as close to companies as owners used to be.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>I am not for a moment suggesting that the relationship between owners and companies was always healthy; sometimes they were too close to the company and interfered far too much. But it is undoubtedly very difficult to get a relationship with investors. It is a simple question of time; it is all right for the BPs of this world, but for the vast number of companies it is more difficult. I was chairman of a company with just under &#163;400 million market cap; expecting shareholders to spend time seeing me even on a once-a-year basis is frankly over-optimistic in such a circumstance. You cannot get an effective dialogue going.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>I shall concentrate on the issue of shareholders and directors, leaving others who are more expert to concentrate on the important provisions on audit. &quot;Shareholders&quot; is a term that covers a multitude of sins, as it includes owners, directors, officers and staff, all of whom may be thought to have an interest greater than simply financial in the company. It also involves real investors, such as institutions, which think, at least at the beginning, that they will be in for the long term. But it includes, too, straightforward gamblers, who are gambling on an increase in the share price. There is nothing wrong with that; it is a perfectly proper use of the stock market. People frequently gamble on a company being taken over, which is hardly always in the best interests of the company, but it is a straight punt&#151;instead of backing horses, you back shares. Almost instinctively, you ask yourself whether those people have exactly the same rights as someone who has held shares for 30 years. Regrettably, the answer must be yes, as I see no other way of dealing with it&#151;and the rewards of holding shares for a long time should come through mitigating capital gains tax on them, as in fairness the Chancellor has by and large done, so that there are distinct benefits to encourage long-term shareholding, which is preferable to short-term shareholding.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>There is also a difficulty with shareholders who are remote that they always want verification of things, because they are dealing with people whom they do not really know. That creates a kind of &quot;audit society&quot;, when people look for every statement to be vouched for by an independent observer. Life does not work that way.

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>I accept that rules are necessary&#151;and, to some extent, cars with good brakes can drive faster, so rules are helpful. They help entrepreneurism. But there comes a point when the scaffolding of regulation can obscure the structure of the building. I hope that we do not ever reach that stage in corporate governance, or it will become a joke. The problem is that if you over-rely on rules, you get a false sense of security. I remind the House that Enron was given an A-rating by CalPERS&#151;and if that rating was translated into an investment decision, a lot of public service employees in California must be slightly worried about their pensions.

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>As for directors, I rather like the concept of enlightened shareholder value, although whether you should put it in a statutory code or deal with it in another way I am not quite sure. I shall consider that in Committee. But I rather like the idea, as it is common sense that directors&#039; enlightened self-interest should lead them to do all the things that various noble Lords would like to see done. The only difficulty is trying to do that by legislating for it; the idea that by legislating for something you achieve it is a delusion that politicians constantly suffer from; it does not work that way. Frequently what happens is that if you over-legislate, people simply avoid the legislation. That is why the legal profession is quite as well remunerated as it is at the moment.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>As good example of this, I bumped into a contemporary of mine at Glasgow University, Sir Menzies Campbell&#151;and in the light of current circumstances I should say that he is much younger than I am&#151;who reminded me that there is an international athletics regulation that at the Olympics or the Commonwealth Games, there should be a 14-foot fence between the male and the female quarters. When there were games in Brazil, that regulation was observed by putting a single strand of wire 14 feet off the ground&#151;and a lot of legislation is very much like that.
</p>

<a name="60111-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>In conclusion, I urge noble Lords to look at ways in which to promote the restoration of trust, because unless you have trust between shareholder and director, no codes are going to work. The crooks will still get away with it, and the good guys will avoid going into business. You have to restore trust&#151;and I believe that the Bill could go a long way to doing that. I believe that it is capable of amendment, I hope beneficial, in Committee.

<a name="60111-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Haskel: </b>   My Lords, I come from the generation of business people who admire Peter Drucker as a business guru. He was one of the very first to say that free enterprise cannot be justified because it is good for business. It can be justified only because it is good for society. I think many of us who have spoken this evening would agree with that. This Bill helps to achieve that, and generally has my support.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>Another thing I would like to say about the Bill is that it has not been prompted by scandal. My noble friend Lord Gordon referred to this. Corporate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_230"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 230</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scandal in America prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 as an immediate response. Most now agree that it was clumsy and unnecessarily onerous and placed American companies at a disadvantage, so, like my noble friend, I think the Government were right to take their time over this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Some noble Lords have wondered if the Bill is deregulatory. Of course it is. Two-thirds of the old Companies Act has gone in order to delete the outdated Victorian ideas that we should have got rid of years ago. Certainly there are additions, but they too are long overdue. The most important of these is a clear statement of the duties of directors. Because of the absence of this statement of duties, lawyers usually told directors that their sole duty was to look after the interests of the shareholders. In my view, that has been the major cause of short-termism and malicious harassment of directors.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Patten, and the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, I welcome the Bill identifying the various interests and stakeholders to which directors should have regard in fulfilling their duties. I agree with my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis that perhaps this could be established rather more firmly. At the same time there are measures to strengthen the directors&#039; accountability to shareholders, and the ability of shareholders to hold directors to account. An important change incorporated in Part 11 of the Bill is that if the shareholders sue directors, any damages accrue to the company and not the claimant shareholders. Some&#151;including the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, and my noble friend Lady Goudie&#151;argued that this may lead to American-type class actions. I do not think so. It is contrary to the business culture we have here.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>I agree with the Minister that removing a lot of the old Victorian rules effectively deregulates and simplifies the formation and running of small private companies. Providing a model set of rules, simplifying reporting, and abolishing the need for meetings, for company secretaries and for maintaining certain registers all eases the administrative burden, and it is to be welcomed. Many of these things have become meaningless. They are simply routine, and serve no purpose at all in most small companies. However, removing these regulations does not mean that directors of private companies can become sloppy. They still have a duty of care to the shareholders and stakeholders that has to be taken seriously, and that is only right. In my 30 years&#039; experience in business, many companies got into difficulties because the directors failed in these duties. I hope the Minister will reassure me that the removal of the administrative and regulatory burdens for small companies in no way diminishes the duties of care that directors have to ensure the success of the business, because that is especially important in private companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The Minister told us that one of the objectives of this legislation is to &quot;enhance shareholder engagement&quot;. No one could argue with this objective; indeed, the combined code encourages active shareholding. However, as the Minister told us, the nature of shareholding has changed in recent years. Some of us <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_231"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

own shares in our own name, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, pointed out, many of us own shares through collective savings like PEPs, ISAs, pension funds or unique trusts. These are all held in a pooled nominee account, so there is just one name on the share register. The Share Centre, which is a share-dealing organisation in the City, agrees with the noble Baroness that over 40 per cent of personal shareholdings have no shareholder rights because their shares are held in nominee accounts. The Share Centre is concerned about this, and I think it has a point. The Bill identifies the problem in Clauses 136-37. These clauses allow companies and shareholders to amend the company&#039;s articles to enable the shareholders to enjoy their rights voluntarily, or, as in Clause 137, the Secretary of State can compel companies to do so.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, spoke about a voluntary system, but even so the Bill could go further. The reason for nominee accounts is the expense of companies keeping detailed shareholder records. That may have been true 20 years ago, but today information processing and storing electronic data have become so cheap that anything you ever communicate again in your life can be stored for ever. The Bill recognises this by allowing electronic share records and transfers. If companies are going to take advantage of this, they should also commit to providing governance rights for their individual shareholders grouped in nominee accounts. Instead of the Secretary of State having to make regulations to compel companies to do this, it should happen automatically when companies take advantage of the electronic communication rules under Schedules 6 and 7. This would enfranchise all nominee shareholders, and would be in keeping with the Government&#039;s objective of enhancing shareholder engagement. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to say something about this.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>Like other noble Lords, I have noticed in recent years that there has been a rise in different kinds of shareholders. There is a shareholder who views a share as a financial instrument, quite separate from the company. He does not actually need to own shares: they could be hedged, borrowed or derived, and traded as an asset, entirely separate from the company or its governance. He may not hold any financial asset, instead using derivatives to mimic these assets. I am told these derivatives are a good thing, and are used mostly for hedging and for spreading risk. But forecasters say that the derivatives market will grow this year to more than 10 times the world&#039;s domestic product, and I am forced to wonder why you need to hedge more than once. The Bill is strangely quiet about this kind of shareholding. Does this mean the Government are not concerned, or do they hope that the European transparency directive relating to the disclosure of shareholding will clarify this? Or do they think the FSA is the competent authority to deal with it? Perhaps the Minister can tell us.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>I have the feeling that the enormous growth of that kind of activity has taken all of us, and the Government, by surprise. There are probably more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_232"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

surprises in store, because new instruments are being invented all the time. To deal with this rapid change in types of shareholding and financial instruments, company law has to be frequently updated, so we need the facility to respond quickly. That is why I welcome the power to reform company law by secondary legislation in Part 31 of the Bill. Clauses 776 to 782 impose a lot of restrictions on government action, but even so, in the report published last month, your Lordships&#039; Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee concluded that Part 31 should be removed from the Bill. I would regret that. In spite of the concerns of the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, I think a way has to be found to maintain this right. The Financial Reporting Council has been given the task of keeping these matters under review, but surely the Government must be in a position to react should the council convince Ministers that it is necessary to update the law. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what the Government will do about this.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>This is a huge and complicated Bill. Like other noble Lords, I do not think there are a lot of votes in it, so there must have been a temptation to put it to one side. But it is important for the economy. It helps to maintain Britain&#039;s being a fair, reasonable, well regulated and secure place to do business. That is why I welcome the Bill.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="60111-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, first, I echo the remarks made by many noble Lords in acknowledging the impressive maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone, who is in her place. I have been acquainted with her in the Farnham area on the Surrey/Hampshire border for more than 20 years and I very much appreciated, for example, her support in the 1980s in my role as chairman of Farnham Roads Action regarding the construction of the A331 Blackwater Valley route. That was at the time that a certain Peter Bottomley was Minister for Roads. I think that I can now say that after 20 years. The road had huge benefits for Farnham and all the surrounding areas. I am sure that the noble Baroness will agree that the road has considerably enhanced the local environment.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>I was also interested to hear about the upbringing of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. She reflected certain prejudices along the lines that companies are not made in heaven. Having spent 35 years as a trade union official, I have similar feelings. But the question is where do we go from here? We have to balance a number of considerations. That is why I welcome the fact that directors are codified for the first time in the Bill. They have to act in the interests of shareholders, but pay regard to the longer term and the interests of employees, suppliers, consumers and the environment. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will not downplay the significance of that. I will return to that point at the end of my remarks.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>How does that codification square with the dictum that &quot;companies exist for their members&quot;? We are all aware of the rules of the Stock Exchange, but, as has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_233"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 233</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

just been said, in the era of hedge funds, regarding so-called members of the company who can often be speculative owners, in and out in a few weeks, when their shark-like activity has from their point of view driven the share price first down and then up again, do these members have long-term interest in the company? Clearly not. We must get behind the rhetoric.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, in an interesting formulation said that people must feel involved in the companies that they invest in. Although he did not use this maxim, but what about, &quot;people must feel involved in the companies they work in&quot;? At that level of philosophy, I am sure the noble Lord would agree that those phrases cannot be put in any order of merit. The formulation that people must feel involved in the companies that they invest in lacks the ring of credibility in the real world for two reasons. First, ownership&#151;for example, through pension funds&#151;is hardly likely to mean that one identifies particularly with the company; we do not know which companies we are investing in, do we? I shall refer to that again in relation to Clause 866, because I strongly support transparency of voting by institutional and other investors. Secondly, I must try to rephrase the noble Lord&#039;s maxim, because it suggests that it is impossible within the philosophy of Anglo-Saxon company law to do anything about this. I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, believes that the codification of the duties of directors is meaningful. I hope that it is meaningful and I hope that the Minister will say that it is meaningful and that it means something substantive; I know that he will wish to respond to that.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton referred to the CBI in the 1970s. I echo his comments in terms of the CBI&#039;s evidence to the Bullock Committee, of which we were both members. He made an excellent point, which I wish to reiterate. The Bill is very similar to what the CBI said it wanted in 1975 in its evidence to that committee. I do not know what that proves, but it is an interesting reflection. Maybe it has taken the CBI over 30 years to catch up with that limited thought. I echo my noble friend&#039;s point about the tendency of the system&#151;I will not use the &quot;c&quot; word&#151;to produce more inequality. There seems to be an income distribution that is out of control within remuneration committees. In those countries which have a two-tier board system, or at least the remuneration committees in the successful Scandinavian model, and those countries with a GDP per head that is higher than ours and which compete in the global market&#151;have a different philosophy about executive remuneration that is not against the interests of successful companies. They really could be said to believe in the idea of one happy family. But the idea that we have one happy family in our income distribution takes the biscuit in lacking credibility. All levels of employees should be represented on remuneration committees.
</p>

<a name="60111-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, who is welcome to intervene if I am wrong, asked whether some of the philosophical questions in the Bill and the whole <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_234"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 234</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

question of directors&#039; duties were a change of words or a change of policy. I am on the side of this being a change of policy, not just a change of words. If that dichotomy is to mean anything, we would not be making such a meal of a change in directors&#039; duties if it was words without policy. That cannot possibly be the case, but I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, will put her own gloss on that. It will be interesting to see which way she jumps. Is it a change of words or is it a change of policy? I look forward to hearing what is in her mind.

<a name="60111-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I was talking about where some clauses are transposed word for word&#151;not about Part 10&#151;and where some clauses transposed with some odd words changed. We want to know whether those odd words in clauses throughout the Bill, not just in Part 10, signify a real change in thought and intent by the Government, or whether they are just trying to make a change to reflect modern practice. The purpose is to make sure that subsequent case law can be judged in the courts on the proper basis of what the Government intended.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60111-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for that clarification. It does not remove my point that it could apply to the central debate that has been continuing for much of the evening about the codification of directors&#039; duties. Is this just playing with words or is it a change of policy? As the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said, there is something quite meaningful about the codification and my noble friend the Minister will comment that.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>I wish also to make a point about the dog that has not barked in this debate when it comes to modern companies. This must be the only economic debate that I can remember in the past couple of years when we have not talked about India and China. Yet it is remarkable, is it not, that here we have employees who are spread around the world? They have international trade unions. We have all sorts of ramifications of the global economy and I am a little surprised that I have not heard much about that, whether it is a European company or any other global phenomenon.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>In conclusion, will my noble friend confirm that the phrase &quot;so far as reasonably practicable&quot; does not mean that directors only have to have regard to these other interests when they do not find it particularly inconvenient to do so? I ask my noble friend to give a definitive assurance that the proviso about &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; will not drive a coach and horses through the clause as a whole.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Finally, I echo those who have said that the operational and financial review in its new guise is important to produce a narrative which will give some substance to the philosophy of the Bill. As I have mentioned, I also believe it is very important that Clause 866 concerning transparency of voting will go a little way towards shareholders&#039; understanding of companies, as the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Freeman, have advocated.

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="60111-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Tunnicliffe: </b>   My Lords, I start by declaring an interest as a non-executive director of three SMEs. I generally support the Bill and I want to make two brief points. As a member of the Merits Committee of this House, it is brought home to me every Tuesday how incredibly inaccessible UK legislation is. It is made up of statutory instruments that amend statutory instruments that stand upon Acts that amend Acts that amend Acts. This is not a consolidation Bill but it is great step forward. I congratulate the Government, the DTI and the draftsmen for taking so much of the 1985 Act, changing it and presenting it in a sensible and well written way. I have read about 50 of the 880 clauses. They are in plain language and stand by themselves, and I believe that this form and shape will make our debate in Grand Committee much more practical because we will all know more readily what each other is talking about.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I want to talk briefly about Part 10, which I welcome. I particularly welcome the codification of general duties set out in Clauses 155 to 161. I disagree with the noble Lords, Lord Freeman and Lord Patten, that those clauses are not a good thing, and I very much look forward to the debate in Grand Committee clarifying what they mean. I hope that we will be able to persuade the noble Lords that they are no greater burden and that they are about certainty. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn brought out the point that they are based on certain common law rules and equitable principles. In other words, this code of conduct is what we have now but, to the average citizen, what we have now is obscure because it is in case law and common law and in the whole sense of equitable principles. It is for the Government, under questioning, to prove specifically that Clauses 155 to 161 will be no greater burden.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I read those clauses and I think that I understand them. I particularly welcome Clause 156, which entails the principle of &quot;enlightened shareholder value&quot;. However, Clause 156 is entitled, &quot;Duty to promote the success of the company&quot;. The first requirement of the clause is to promote the company for the benefit of all members as a whole. Subsection (3) qualifies that by requiring the directors to take a long-term decision and have regard to the long term, the company&#039;s employees, the relationship with suppliers, the impact of the operations on the community, high standards of business conduct and acting fairly between the members. We will have to flesh out the hierarchy of those parts working together. There is some guidance in the Explanatory Notes on the clause. They state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;It will not be sufficient to pay lip service to the factors&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Conversely, they state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;At the same time, directors are not required to do more than is practically possible in the circumstances of any particular business decision&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>Provided that that balance is right and that it works effectively and passes the test of adding no greater burden than is presently the case, I think that this is a good clause.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_236"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 236</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The other clause that I welcome&#151;once again, I look forward to listening to the debate that fleshes it out&#151;is Clause 158. Far too often I have heard the argument that all directors are the same and therefore, by implication, they shall be equally knowledgeable and skilled. Clause 158 seems to me to set out that each director&#039;s skill and ability shall be reasonable and appropriate, which is not the same as saying that they will be the same as each other. Therefore, while you expect certain skills from, say, the finance director, the development director and the design director, from other directors you expect only the skills that they need to bring to the task that they do on that board of directors. I believe that that is a clarification and I hope that the debate will make it even more black and white.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The codification will clearly be valuable to all directors. But one has to remember that, in a sense, there are two classes of director. There are those who are directors of large companies and quoted companies. In the case of large companies, the support of legal advice will be immediately available to them. The directors of quoted companies, who are what one might call &quot;professional directors&quot;, have a duty to ensure that they are well briefed on those duties. But the vast majority of directors in this country are directors of small and medium-sized enterprises. They may be family firms as small as my neighbour&#039;s tree surgery company right through to larger firms&#151;not-for-profit firms that nevertheless work under the Companies Acts. Some companies are owned by charities. The people involved in such companies want a simple statement of their duties. I believe that these three pages of the Bill do provide a simple statement of those duties.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I hope that in Grand Committee we will convince the noble Lords, Lord Freeman and Lord Patten, that the Bill does not add burden and that it creates certainty. My business experience is that, when you create certainty, you reduce costs and you increase effectiveness. I look forward to following the Bill through Grand Committee.

I did not realise that it was her maiden speech until I saw the list of speakers, but she undoubtedly showed the charm and effectiveness that were the hallmarks of her performances in another place.

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>In welcoming the Bill, as I think all speakers have done so far, first I join my noble friend Lord Sharman and the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, in saying how disappointed we are that this does not constitute a proper consolidation of company law. Those of us who spent 30 years practising as company lawyers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_237"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 237</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would not agree with the Minister&#039;s reference to the fact that it is all right that we do not have a consolidation because, after all, we can always look it up in <i>Butterworths.</i> Those of us who have attempted to look it up in <i>Butterworths</i> over 30 years have found that it is not as easy as the Minister professes. Therefore I think that it is a matter for regret that the Government have not taken the time to introduce one codified piece of legislation that sets out company law in a consolidated form.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>I will not go through the many points that noble Lords on all sides of the Chamber have made, but I shall make one or two general points, and raise one or two detailed points that have not been touched upon. First, there is a concern in the speeches of a lot of noble Lords&#151;and in briefings that noble Lords have had from both the CBI and the Law Society&#151;that the effect of this legislation will be to introduce a novel concept into English company law: interference by the judiciary in the exercise of business judgments by directors. There has been a tradition in this country that our company law disputes are primarily resolved in ways other than litigation. There is a concern right across the board that the Bill is in danger of driving a coach and horses through that principle. It does so in three ways.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>First, on the director&#039;s duties under Part 10, we on these Benches, like most noble Lords, obviously welcome the concept of enlightened shareholder value and the idea of a director&#039;s responsibilities being more widely defined, as they are in this Bill. However, the difficulties which go to my general point are the imprecision in drafting, which we can probably deal with in Grand Committee. Moreover, many of us feel that the interplay between statutory obligations and common law remedies is likely to lead to a considerable increase in litigation, to the detriment of the corporate wheel.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>There is also real concern, which I share, over derivative claims and Clauses 239 to 246. These provisions, including the possibility of third parties being joined in proceedings, are likely to encourage the threat of litigation not only by shareholders but also by those who may not have regard to the long-term interests of the company and shareholders as a body. That is a concern that we will need to come back to.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Thirdly, as one or two noble Lords have mentioned, there is a danger of litigation becoming commonplace in major takeover transactions for the first time, almost in the American style. In general terms, the law of unintended consequences is starting to be a problem. As the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone, said, there is a concern that the likely emphasis on litigation is going to discourage the pool of those from whom non-executive directors in particular can be drawn, at a time when all the other pressures on corporate governance are to increase that pool of talented people and the number of those who are prepared to take that function on. That is a concern. With the practice that is starting to happen in the United States and with UK individuals being asked to be directors of US companies, there is already, as a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 238</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related legislation, a serious reluctance to take on those responsibilities. We would not want that to occur here, particularly as a result of the passing of this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Two other principles have been touched on by other noble Lords. First, I will not say that a number of people are &quot;browned off&quot; by the announcement of the cancellation of the Operating and Financial Review, because that would be a terrible pun&#151;but they clearly are. The Chancellor of the Exchequer clearly thought that he was going to get the unanimous support of the City and business by announcing this measure. Of course, he had forgotten, as my noble friend Lord Sharman said, that most companies in the City had already spent large amounts of money and time in getting ready to comply with the Operating Financial and Review. Most of them were entirely happy to comply with it. If the Chancellor wanted to announce something to reduce the burden of regulation, he could have thought of one or two other things rather than this. As my noble friend Lord Sharman indicated, what was going to go in the Operating and Financial Review is going to go, for most listed companies, in other parts of the accounts in any event. That will be a requirement of the stock exchange listing agreement. We therefore think that that is a mistake on the Government&#039;s part.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>The second general principle is that we have concerns about the mechanism which the Government are choosing for amending this legislation. We understand the argument that the legislative timetable would be in difficulty if we said that we must have a major company law reform Bill every two or three years. However, there is dissatisfaction over the mechanism, and we will have to look at the detail of that in Grand Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Two or three points have not been touched on. First&#151;and you might expect me to say this&#151;this is an opportunity to get the law on the disclosure of political donations right, in particular the definition of a political donation. There are significant practical difficulties, not major issues of principle, in determining what is or is not a political donation. For example, when Sainsbury&#039;s goes to each party conference and sponsors a reception, does that constitute a political donation? There is some opaqueness in that and people are interpreting it in different ways. Is it for the benefit of Sainsbury&#039;s business and therefore not a political donation; or is it for the benefit of the party in question and therefore a political donation? There is an opportunity to tighten that up in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Secondly&#151;and I am not sure that anybody has touched on this important issue for smaller private companies&#151;what are such companies allowed to do on offers to the public; in other words, the interplay between the rules regarding prospectuses and the rules under company law? The Law Society feels, as do I, that this is an opportunity missed to tighten up and clarify those rules.
</p>

<a name="60111-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>Finally, we on these Benches welcome this Bill. We are clearly going to have a lengthy time in Committee. In closing, I hope that the captains of industry who so <br>&nbsp;<br>

often grace the Benches of this House by their absence will find the time to come and give us the benefit of their wisdom and experience in Committee. After all, that is why, we were told, they are here.

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="60111-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I start by reminding the House of my interests as declared in the register. In particular, I am a non-executive director of four listed companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Today&#039;s debate has shown your Lordships&#039; House at its very best. We have had some well-informed contributions from a number of different angles. For me, however, the high point was the maiden speech of my noble friend Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone. We all know of her outstanding track record in government, in health and, in particular, in national heritage. Today, however, we saw her reveal her in-depth knowledge of contemporary corporate issues. It was a marvellous speech and we hope that she will be joining us as we journey through the remaining stages of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>My noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbots set out our general approach to the Bill in his opening speech and he welcomed the Bill in principle. He set out our three tests for the Bill. Is it really deregulatory? Does it make company law more comprehensible? Do the proposals strike the right balance? I am afraid that we cannot give the Minister 10 out of 10 on any of these tests. My noble friend referred to several areas which we will want to pursue in Committee. The Minister will have noted my noble friend&#039;s concerns about the powers in Part 31. Those concerns were shared by a number of other noble Lords. My noble friend Lord Freeman and the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, were particularly robust on this matter. I was glad to hear that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, also has concerns about it. The recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee was strong and clear, and we cannot brush that aside. We will of course return to the matter in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Part 11, which deals with derivative actions, has also raised many concerns. My noble friend Lord Trenchard supported my noble friend Lord Hodgson in raising them, and the Liberal Democrat Benches share the same concerns. I foresee another heavy Committee sitting on that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, predicted.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>We are delighted that my noble friend Lord Freeman will be leading for us on Part 10 of the Bill. He made some powerful points in his speech about the new formulation of the duties of directors. The Government have said that the Bill largely codifies the law as it stands, but we are simply not convinced that this is the case. In answer to the probing question of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, it probably does change the law and we are not entirely happy about it.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>In principle, it is good to see that Clause 156 emphasises the duty of directors to promote the success of the company for the benefit of the members. That seems to be superficially attractive, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_240"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but my noble friend Lord Patten exposed the complete lack of clarity in this formulation. Part 10 will receive the most careful scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>My noble friend Lord Hodgson has already said that I will be leading for these Benches on Parts 15, 16 and 33; namely, those parts which deal with accounts, audits and auditors. Part 15 starts fairly uncontroversially by stating that, in relation to accounts, its main distinctions are between small companies and other companies, and between quoted companies and unquoted companies. Would that it were so simple. There are also distinctions between public companies and private companies. Medium-sized companies have some rules too. Part 16, which deals with audited accounts, also makes special provisions for dormant companies, for charities and non-profit-making companies subject to public audit, and a miscellany of other kinds of companies.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The Bill really has not made this area very much more simple or accessible. It is not a trivial issue. If I were responsible for running a small or a medium-sized company, I would have to wade through 99 sections in Part 15 and a fair part of the 72 sections in Part 16 before I was sure of my obligations. That is an unnecessary bonus for accountants and lawyers, and it certainly does not contribute to deregulation.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has, somewhat dubiously, already claimed his deregulatory credit for the amendments to Part 15, which we will be expecting in due course, in relation to the OFR. A number of noble Lords have spoken about that. My noble friend Lord Hodgson and the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, have already queried exactly what the Government intend. Will it be the business review requirement under the European directive or will it go further? Companies need some certainty on this. Having already made one abortive attempt at gearing up to meet one set of requirements, they need to know what is expected of them.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>We have heard a number of views today about the OFR. I confess that, somewhat unfashionably, I have never been convinced that there was sufficient evidence of benefit outweighing cost to justify a statutory requirement. Indeed, I had intended to table amendments to take the OFR out of the Bill in order to debate those issues.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Whatever the precise form of the amendment when we come to consider the Bill in Committee, there will be a need for a business review&#151;we know that much&#151;and we know that that will require companies to make forward-looking statements. We agree with the CBI and others that a safe harbour provision is necessary to allow meaningful statements to be made by directors in this area.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>We particularly welcome Clause 366, which states that accounts are to give a true and fair view. This might seem a small point, but its absence as an explicit requirement was a source of potential problems when international financial reporting standards were introduced, but it is a pity that the even bigger problem that is affected by IFRS&#151;namely, distributions, to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_241"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 241</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, referred&#151;has not been dealt with in this Bill. We will want to look at that in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>So far as the rest of Part 15 is concerned, we will want to return to various aspects during the Bill&#039;s passage; for example, the new duties on directors in relation to directors&#039; reports and the new duties on quoted companies in relation to websites. We will be looking in particular at the practical issues that arise in these areas.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The Minister will not be surprised to find that the new provisions in Part 16, which restrict the liability of auditors, will be a focus of attention. There has been much rejoicing among auditors over Clause 518. While I do not believe that there is much objection to the principle, there are a number of practical issues to consider and to which I am sure we will return in Committee. In particular, we need to understand why the Government have not drafted explicitly for proportionate liability, because that is what we understood to be the agreement between all the parties who had been involved in the discussions about auditor liability during many months and years.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I have one question for the Minister on this clause. When the Bill was published, his right honourable friend Mr Alun Michael was reported to have said that audit fees would be expected to fall once auditors had successfully limited their liability using this new facility. This is a matter of some concern to companies which have been faced with audit fees ratcheting upwards in recent years. I hope that the Minister will indicate what information the Government have on the cost/benefit equation as it affects audit fees.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>As we have already heard, auditors&#039; rejoicing over liability limitation has been counterbalanced by their dismay at the new criminal offence of recklessly giving an audit report, as set out in Clause 494. We are not convinced that the concept of recklessness in the absence of dishonesty has any place in the scheme of offences under the Bill. However, offences based on recklessness for directors already exist, and it would be easy to conclude that even-handedness requires that auditors should be subject to similar requirements, but I am not sure that the public interest is necessarily served by this. A number of practical issues arise; for example, the interaction between the individual auditor who signs the accounts and his firm; between the criminal law process and the independent disciplinary arrangements that already exist. These interactions may impede achieving the desired outcome, which I assume is to stop the auditor concerned carrying out any more audits. We all need to look at this matter very carefully during the passage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The final part which I shall address is Part 33, which deals with statutory auditors. This is a part of the Bill which I believe even auditors do not find very exciting. We definitely welcome the Government&#039;s long-overdue implementation of the report of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and their allowing the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the accounts of companies. Without in any sense <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_242"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 242</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

qualifying that welcome, I give notice that we will want to examine the detail of that when we reach the later stages of the Bill. We will want to ensure in particular that the supervisory arrangements that have been specially created for the Auditors General are completely independent of them. The Minister will be aware that the current Comptroller and Auditor General is currently the chairman of the public oversight body for auditors, which is, as I understand it, likely to carry out the supervisory tasks set out in Part 33.
</p>

<a name="60111-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Lastly, I return to the Bill overall. My noble friend Lord Hodgson and other noble Lords have already referred to the way that company law will continue to be scattered over several Acts once the Bill is enacted. We simply do not buy the argument that users are content with that and are happy to carry on purchasing the <i>Butterworths</i> book in order to get some sense of how the legislation fits together. I simply give the Minister notice today that we will wish to return to this issue during the passage of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="60111-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, all noble Lords who know the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley of Nettlestone, expected a fine maiden speech and, of course, we were not disappointed. She is the daughter of John Garnett, who was a behavioural scientist for many years, and she was a very distinguished Secretary of State for Health and for National Heritage. She brings much experience, as well as charm and intelligence, to the House, and I know that in future greatly benefit from it.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Many interesting and important points have been raised today, from a number of different perspectives. The Bill has been the subject of extensive consultation with business, the legal and accountancy professions and other interested parties and today&#039;s debate has shown that it will continue to attract a high level of detailed and expert scrutiny during its passage.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>This is obviously a complex Bill. Before dealing with the key points raised in today&#039;s debate, I would like to comment on two issues, both raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, which are relevant to how we handle the Bill in Committee,. The first issue is regulations and how we plan to use the powers in the Bill. Much company law is still set out in primary legislation, but the Bill contains roughly 130 substantive individual provisions for delegated legislation, of which about half are new powers to make regulations, and the rest amend, re-enact or restate existing powers. We have used subordinate legislation for a number of reasons; for example, to avoid putting detailed technical provisions on the face of the Bill; to ensure flexibility in responding to changing circumstances, especially technological advance and greater international mobility; and to allow the registrar of companies to make the detailed rules associated with delivering and filing documents.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>In a number of areas we have already published detail on the regulations which are planned. For example, we published draft model articles for private <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_243"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

companies for consultation in March last year, and will publish drafts for public companies during the passage of the Bill. The Takeover Panel similarly published, in November 2005, full details of its proposals for the use of the rule-making power to be extended to it in relation to takeovers and other regulatory matters.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>It must also be stressed that there are a number of powers contained in the Bill where the Government have no current plans to make regulations. They are included to maintain flexibilities and to anticipate future developments, or to act as a back-stop in case market developments do not in themselves deliver the changes which we want to see made. The Government would expect to consult should it become necessary to use these powers in future. I will come later to the proposed company law reform power.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>The second issue is the change of words from the 1985 Act and where a change of wording is a matter of substance, and where it is merely cosmetic.  This was also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. Our underlying approach in this Bill has been to simplify. Sometimes this has been a question of making substantive changes of policy, and sometimes it has been more an issue of simplifying the drafting of the law to make the language more accessible or consistent, or to reorder the provisions in a more logical way. This approach has been widely welcomed, and I am very pleased that the reactions we have had from stakeholders to the new Bill suggest that the draftsman has been remarkably successful in setting out the law in a way which is as clear and accessible as possible.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>But I recognise that there can sometimes be questions as to whether a particular change in the language represents a change of substance, with real legal effect, or is a change in language. My department has produced a table of destinations and derivations, showing for each clause in the Bill where it derives from an existing section of the 1985 Act or elsewhere and, if so, whether it introduces a change of substance or is more by way of a simple restatement of the existing provision. That document has been placed in the House Library and is available on the DTI website. I hope it will be of some assistance.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Of course, we will come at later stages in the House to discuss individual clauses in more detail. If and when it would be helpful to remove doubt, I will, of course, be very happy to set out the position in respect of specific provisions in more detail.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>I would now like to comment on some of the key issues raised during the debate. The Bill has more than 800 clauses and the debate involved 21 speakers who raised more than 100 questions, so I cannot answer all of them. I shall try to cover the fundamental issues in the Bill and we will have plenty of time in Committee to cover the detailed points.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>I shall start with directors&#039; duties, which are at the heart of the Bill. The noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Freeman, raised the accessibility of law on directors&#039; duties. Codification will help to make the law clearer, but we also need to make the law more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_244"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 244</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

accessible to the thousands of directors who, quite understandably, will not read companies legislation, however elegantly or clearly drafted. That is why we are also committed to producing plain language guidance which will be made available to all directors.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>Clause 156 addresses the key issue of in whose interests a company should be run. The clause enshrines in statute a concept which the Company Law Review called &quot;enlightened shareholder value&quot;. This has two main elements: it gives directors the clarity they need by setting as their objective the success of the company for the benefit of shareholders collectively and, at the same time, the clause recognises that a focus on the short-term financial bottom line cannot deliver long-term prosperity. Directors, in fulfilling the duty, are therefore required to have regard to factors such as the long-term consequences of their decisions, the interests of employees and the impact on the community and the environment &quot;so far as reasonably practicable&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>I am aware that some noble Lords would prefer an approach which the Company Law Review called &quot;pluralism&quot;, and I believe that that is the direction in which the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, were heading. Under it, directors would be required to serve a wide range of interests. Both the Company Law Review and the Government have considered the case for a &quot;pluralist&quot; approach very carefully. There are three main reasons why we do not believe it would be the best way forward: a pluralist approach would muddy the waters unhelpfully; directors would lack clarity about what they were meant to be doing; and it would, in practice, be more difficult for anyone to hold directors to account. Secondly, company law reform is not a suitable vehicle for our wider agenda on corporate social responsibility. Issues such as environmental protection and health and safety are very important, but they should not be addressed through company law reform. The best way to promote responsible business behaviour is to show how such behaviour leads to business success.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Sharman and Lord Clinton-Davis, and the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, raised the issue, and the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, noted the significance, of the words &quot;so far as reasonably practicable&quot; in Clause 156. They have a dual purpose. First, we recognise that business decision-making will sometimes be constrained by time constraints and other practical limits. That does not, of course, mean that directors can simply ignore factors such as the interests of employees, and it is hard to conceive of any situation, even the most urgent, where it will not be reasonably practicable to give any regard to the factors at all. The words also make clear that directors must consider the factors to the greatest extent that it is reasonably practicable to do so. It is, of course, in the company&#039;s interests that they should do so. The duty of directors is not to consider the factors in a superficial manner as part of a box-ticking exercise, but to think through the long-term implications of their decisions and address potential risks.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_245"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>I believe that our approach in this clause responds to wider expectations of responsible business behaviour in a pragmatic and commonsense way. The clause does not impose new duties on directors, and the duty to promote the success of the company will continue to be governed by the good faith judgment of the directors. The courts should not be any more likely to second guess business decisions taken in good faith by directors.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>The Bill will codify the common law duty of care, skill and diligence without substantive amendment. Recent developments in the law in this area have been influenced by Section 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986, and Clause 158, which introduces a statutory duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence, closely follows this section of the Insolvency Act. The Bill does not make this duty more onerous. On the point from the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, we do not think it will affect director recruitment or behaviour.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>My noble friend Lord Haskel asked for an assurance that the deregulatory measures in the Bill will in no way diminish the duty of care owed to the company by directors of small companies. I am happy to give that assurance. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, asked what the success of the company means and who are its members. Success for a commercial company means, normally, long-term increase in value. For certain companies such as charities and community-interest companies it means achievement of their objectives. Members is a company law term to cover shareholders and guarantors of companies limited by guarantee. It does not include employees.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>The position of auditors is another major issue in the Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, argued that the threat of criminal prosecution will cause all auditors to carry out more checks and be less willing to exercise judgment. There is no reason why they should. If an auditor is not acting recklessly at present there is no reason why they should change their behaviour because we are introducing this offence. The noble Baroness asked for an assurance that honest mistakes would not result in prosecution. I can give that assurance, not because dishonesty is required for committing the offence&#151;it is not&#151;but because to show that an auditor has acted knowingly or recklessly requires more than a mistake. It requires a conscious decision by the auditor: at least a decision to turn a blind eye. It is possible that some auditors may misunderstand the risk of prosecution, and that this could have adverse consequences. We will be happy during our further consideration of the Bill in committee to explain fully what will be the effect of the phrase &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot;, and of the provision as a whole, so as to help avoid such misunderstandings.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>Our proposal on auditor liability addresses the perceived unfairness that can arise when the negligent auditor is the only solvent defendant after a corporate collapse. It could prevent the loss of one of the big four accountancy firms. On the other hand, it gives the company and its shareholders the option whether to agree to a limitation. If they have agreed, the proposal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_246"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 246</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

still ensures that the company has a right to a fair and reasonable compensation from the auditors. The noble Baroness suggests that the Bill as drafted requires a liability limitation agreement to define the limitation as a monetary amount. It does not. The Bill leaves company and auditor free to contract in whatever terms they want. If they were to agree to limit liability to a specific financial limit, it would not be effective if it was not at least fair and reasonable, and the limit would instead be what was fair and reasonable. Having been a finance director for many years, any prediction that audit fees will come down in any circumstances strikes me as incredible. We believe that the clause as drafted will enable the court, if necessary, to determine an amount that is proportionate. It will be able to strike a fair balance between the company and the auditor, taking into account the auditor&#039;s responsibility to the company.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>The Operating and Financial Review was raised by many noble Lords. Our reason for removing the requirement was that the costs associated with it were, we believed, disproportionate. It was about &#163;33 million, of which &#163;31 million was extra audit requirements. I agree with my noble friend Lord Gordon of Strathblane that we have got to the right place but not necessarily by the most elegant route. Companies will still need to include a business review as part of the directors&#039; report, in compliance with the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive requirements. We are committed to improving strategic, forward-looking narrative reporting by companies, and to enhanced dialogue with shareholders based on such reporting. It is important for companies to report on non-financial issues relevant to the development and performance of the business, including, for example, environmental and employee matters. Companies will be required to do this as part of the business review.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>As I explained in my opening statement, we have invited views by 15 February on whether the business review requirements should be clarified to achieve their objectives more effectively. We will take full account of these views on deciding how to frame the amendments we will be bringing forward to the Bill relating to these provisions. Depending on the timing of the Committee stage, we may bring forward amendments either at Committee or Report. In response to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, it is our intention to bring forward amendments to the Bill to remove Clauses 393 to 395 as they currently stand.

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, raised the issue of shareholders&#039; rights. The Government are committed to encouraging the greater enfranchisement of shareholders and the responsible exercise of share ownership rights. That is why the Bill includes new provisions under Clauses 136 and 137 to ensure that companies can enable indirect investors&#151;such as those investing through nominees&#151;to exercise and enjoy varying levels of shareholder rights as suits their needs. The Government believe that a voluntary approach is the better way to achieve greater enfranchisement of indirect investors. However, if the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

market does not develop appropriate solutions the Secretary of State may exercise the power under Clause 137 to compel companies to provide information to indirect investors. The power is intended as an additional tool towards encouraging and achieving greater enfranchisement benefits. Better-informed investors should be better equipped to demand voting and other governance rights from nominees and the companies in which their investments are made.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>My noble friend Lord Haskel suggests that companies taking advantage of the electronic communications provisions should automatically be required to enfranchise nominee shareholders. The extension of governance rights to indirect investors and the provisions enabling companies to default to e-communications are entirely separate measures. E-communications present great opportunities not only to reduce costs, but also to enhance the immediacy of dialogue between companies and their shareholders and indirect investors. However, to make enfranchisement of nominee shareholders mandatory would require a definition of exactly which indirect holders should be enfranchised&#151;which would be difficult. We would therefore prefer market solutions to develop but, if they do not, the power will be available.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, asked what would be an improper use of the register of shareholders. A current issue here is the use of the register of shareholders by animal rights extremists to harass shareholders. That has been a major problem. We have dealt with it as a one-off, but there are other areas where similar activity could occur and we want also to be able to deal with that.
</p>

<a name="60111-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and my noble friend Lord Borrie raised the question of the rules on dividends. My noble friend Lady Goudie also argued that we should expand the Bill to include provisions relaxing the law controlling the payment of dividends by private companies. We understand the concern about current law that links payment of dividends to the concept of realised profits, but the rules on dividends and other distributions are of central importance in protecting creditors and other third parties involved with companies, including lenders, employees, pensioners and trading partners. We see no obvious or simple answer to that complex and important issue. We need to consider it carefully and we intend to do so in full consultation with interested parties.

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="60111-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sharman: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister reflect on my suggestion that dividend distribution policy should be based on a solvency test, which is a simple test: can you afford, in cash terms, to pay the dividend? It is not a structural test, it is a solvency test: can you afford to pay it? That is what is done in the United States.
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="60111-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, we will certainly reflect on that. There are perceived difficulties with that approach, but we will certainly reflect on that and then propose any changes using the proposed reform power in the Bill.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_248"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>I now turn to the reform power, which is clearly a major issue in the Bill and an extremely difficult one. It may be useful to go over the underlying rationale for the proposed company law reform power. As I said, it is usual these days in technically complex areas of law to leave the detail of the provisions to subordinate legislation, but company law has grown over the centuries and many of even its most detailed provisions are written in primary legislation. That creates a challenge when updating the law to reflect a changing business environment. Although it may be relatively easy to secure parliamentary time for a Bill where a change of the law is essential, it can be more difficult in cases where the proposed reform is useful and desirable but where existing law can, at a pinch, limp along as it is.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>An interesting example of that is the 1989 court case known as <i>Aveling Barford</i>, which cast doubt on when a company can make an intra-group transfer of assets at book value. The Bill removes those doubts. That is an example of where it has taken a long time to get parliamentary time.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>We recognise that the power that we have suggested raises important issues. We have designed it as a super-affirmative power, incorporating stringent conditions as to how it can be used, including extensive requirements for public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny. To a large extent, those requirements reflect the existing arrangements of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 and are intended to provide demonstrable and effective safeguards surrounding what can undoubtedly be seen as a very wide and novel power. Notwithstanding those safeguards, important concerns have been raised. As I said, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the chairman of the Constitution Committee raised a number of such concerns and make some powerful arguments. Those committees always, rightly, command the greatest respect in this House and it is important that we reflect on their comments and those that the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, made this afternoon. We consider them seriously; I assure the House that the Government are doing exactly that.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>I believe that the underlying rationale behind the proposal remains compelling. We very much want to achieve an effective and constitutionally appropriate mechanism for necessary changes in future. I hope that we will be able to find such a way through, which can command the support of the House. I have already found today&#039;s debate hugely informative and I look forward to further debates that I am sure we shall have at the Bill&#039;s next stage.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>I remark on two points that were raised in connection with that. The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, asked whether reform powers will require affirmative resolution and whether consultation will be wide. I can confirm that, in addition to the special period for parliamentary scrutiny in which we envisage that Special Committees of both Houses will scrutinise proposals in detail, the Bill also provides for affirmative resolution of orders. I also reassure the noble Lord that full statutory consultation will be necessary before a proposal is made, involving representative interests likely to be substantially affected.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_249"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 249</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis raised the question of the Government needing to take account of consultation before bringing forward a company law reform order. The Minister will need not just to take account of consultation but, as is clear from Clause 785, to summarise the outcome and what account has been taken of it in the document, which we would have to lay before Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>I think that I dealt with the question of consolidation in my opening speech and explained why that is rather a mythical goal to be striving for. We could take the capital maintenance regulations of the 1985 Act and consolidate them in the Bill. That would change some of its wording, which people do not want to see&#151;particularly in view of the fact that, almost certainly, a new Bill will have to come forward with capital maintenance regulations. So, even if we consolidated it briefly now and made people look at some new legislation, we would then simply have an unconsolidated Bill as soon as we brought in the capital maintenance. I cannot see that this is a particularly profitable way to do it. When we push people on this issue we find that everyone is in favour of consolidation, &quot;but not in my lifetime&quot;. That is a perfectly understandable proposition. But, when it comes to the crunch, you have got to make a decision, and we think we are reflecting what people really want to see.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>I believe that there is general agreement about the many issues in the Bill although there are some concerns about particular matters. I also believe it is largely a technical Bill and not controversial in party terms. Nevertheless, company law represents a balance of different interests&#151;this has been reflected in the points of difference that have been raised today&#151;and the Government&#039;s responsibility is to provide a legal framework which reconciles these interests and provides a means of accountability for the exercise of corporate economic power and the safeguards and remedies for abuses of that power. It is an important Bill which will help to ensure that our company regulation and financial markets continue to be regarded as amongst the best in the world. I look forward to detailed debate in Committee.

<a name="60111-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>We will hear many interesting and compelling speeches in this debate today. One voice we shall miss, however&#151;which would have been heard but for his untimely death&#151;was that of Tony Banks, Lord Stratford. He spoke to me before Christmas of his relief that this debate had been postponed so that he <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_250"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 250</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

could express his very great enthusiasm for the Bill and his pride that his area of London would be the major site for the Games.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>He would not only have spoken well in this debate but would have brought to our forthcoming work the real experience he gained when fronting our bid for the football World Cup several years ago. That experience would have been invaluable, communicated by his capacity for directness, his wit and his intelligence. As a former Sports Minister he had so much to offer in this work. But also, of course, he had an interest in the arts and in the general work of the House, which I know in his short time here he had grown to respect.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>London won the Olympic bid because we promised the International Olympic Committee that we were able to deliver. Since July, we have made good on that promise. A huge amount of progress has already been made towards 2012. Compulsory purchase orders have been issued to acquire the land needed in east London; the first contracts have been let to get power lines underground in the area that will become the Olympic Park; an interim Olympic Delivery Authority has been created and the top management team appointed; and the London organising committee for the games has been formally established under the able leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Coe.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>The IOC visited London last November and professed itself extremely happy with the progress we were making. In its view, we are currently two years ahead of the schedule of any previous host city. It was particularly impressed that we had already made such good progress with this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>We could not have made that progress without the help of the Opposition parties. Their support, both for the bid and the work that we have done since, has been unremitting and I thank them for that. I am confident that it will continue&#151;I certainly hope that it will continue&#151;as the Bill goes through the House. It is vital that we get this legislation to Royal Assent as quickly as possible, to put the ODA on an operational footing and to begin the hard work that will be needed to get everything built on time and on budget.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>The Bill does three things, all of which are essential to our success. It establishes the ODA and gives it the powers it needs to get London ready to stage the Games; it provides the powers needed to meet IOC requirements about the way in which the Games and the Olympic environment are managed; and it tailors the powers of other bodies, including the Greater London Authority and regional development agencies, where they have a role in the Olympic project.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>We are also concerned, and were concerned in the other place, to give reassurance about some crucial difficulties surrounding the Bill. We wanted to give clarity and reassurance on how restrictions on ambush marketing will work and who will or will not be caught by these rules. We think we have clarified these matters through the amendments passed in the other place, but we will have time, during Committee, to examine more thoroughly what I recognise to be an interesting and challenging area.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_251"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 251</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>The first half of the Bill deals with the ODA. Clauses 3 to 7 establish the ODA and give it the powers, functions and duties it needs to get London ready for the Games. They include a duty to have regard for the legacy of the Games in everything that is done, and a duty to contribute to sustainable development. It is important not to lose sight of the unique selling point of London&#039;s bid, namely the legacy that the Games will bring to the United Kingdom in terms of sporting facilities and participation, and in the complete regeneration of one of the most deprived areas of London.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>Clause 5 allows the ODA to be appointed as the local planning authority for the Olympic Park, on the same model as an urban development corporation. That should ensure a co-ordinated approach to the development of the park and reduce the risk of unnecessary delays to the project. The precise boundaries of the ODA&#039;s planning powers will be determined by order and of course there will be consultation on that order early this year. Clause 6 requires the ODA to have regard to security in exercising its functions; all noble Lords will recognise how important this dimension is to the successful prosecution of the Games.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>Clauses 10 to 18 deal with transport and establish the ODA as co-ordinating authority for the Olympic transport plan. Existing transport authorities will have a duty to co-operate with the ODA in order to implement this plan and to deliver Olympic transport services. The Bill provides for the creation of an Olympic route network, and the ODA will be able to issue traffic regulation orders on that network.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>The ODA&#039;s role will, of course, evolve over time. It has the important job of constructing the venues and planning transport in the run-up to 2012. It will then co-ordinate transport systems during the Games, and will manage the environment around venues, so that the streets are clean and the Games are not commercially exploited. After the Games, the ODA will take a role in reconfiguring the venues, but that is its final responsibility. It will essentially be a time-limited body, focused on delivering the London Games. Clause 9 therefore provides for the Secretary of State, having consulted the Mayor, to lay an order to dissolve the ODA.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>The second half of the Bill deals mainly with the measures needed to meet the IOC&#039;s requirements for what it terms brand protection. We signed up to meet those requirements when in bidding for the Games. We are therefore bound, under the host city contract, by the IOC&#039;s technical manual on brand protection. We have put a summary of the relevant sections of that manual in the Library. Clauses 19 to 30 allow for regulations to be made controlling outdoor advertising and street trading in the area around Olympic venues. I recognise that this is an issue we will wish to explore in greater detail in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>Clause 31 outlaws ticket touting in connection with the Olympics. Again, this provision is brought in because the IOC requires that ticket touting be prevented. In bidding, London accepted the nature of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_252"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 252</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those requirements. Of course, I am aware that other sporting bodies argue that there should be a wider ban on ticket touting. We in the department are currently working with all sectors, including sport, the arts, the creative industries and other stakeholders to gather evidence about touting practices across a wide range of areas. However, the IOC makes the Olympics a special case and we are under an obligation to meet that.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>Clauses 32 and 33 and Schedules 3 and 4 provide for the protection of Olympic intellectual property. They stop businesses unfairly cashing in on the Olympic or Paralympic Games by wrongly implying that they have some form of commercial or contractual association with the Games. These restrictions are designed to protect the public image of the Games, but they also protect the public purse by maximising sponsorship income.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>Existing legislation already prevents any unofficial commercial use of the word &quot;Olympic&quot; and the Olympic rings, and the main aim of Schedule 3 is to provide equivalent rights to the Paralympics. Schedule 4 extends protection to other, more imaginative forms of association and ambush marketing. But, contrary to some press reports, it will not place a blanket ban on using words such as &quot;summer&quot; and &quot;games&quot;. Factual references to London and to the Olympics will still be perfectly legal. So will explanations of the purpose or characteristics of any goods or services. So will editorial use in media coverage.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>In its final clauses, the Bill provides new Olympic-specific powers for the Greater London Authority and the RDAs to ensure that they can make the contribution that we require of them. Clauses 34 and 35 give the GLA a specific power to prepare for the Olympics because it was the Mayor of London, along with the British Olympic Association, who signed the host city contract with the IOC. So to provide absolute clarity that the Mayor is able to honour his commitments, the Bill makes it clear that he and the GLA have the power to comply with his obligations under the contract and to prepare for and manage aspects of the London Olympics. There should be no need for this power after the Games, and Clause 35 therefore provides for it to be switched off by the Secretary of State. A similar power is given to RDAs in Clause 36.
</p>

<a name="60111-22_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The Olympics present us with a wealth of opportunities. We need to make the most of them. In 1948, with the world still recovering from war, London put together a memorable Olympic Games when no one else was able to. For 2012, expectations will be much higher. And no one has higher expectations than the residents of east London. That was clear in their enthusiastic reaction to our victory on 6 July. We must make every effort to make the Olympic dream comes true for those people and for the whole of the United Kingdom. The Bill is the first step towards success. I commend it to the House.

He was into everything, a leader, a player, a sportsman and probably, reading about him, a tease. I wish to associate myself and my party with the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Davies, and my own personal tribute to Tony Banks.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>We as a nation have been charged with the welcome task of delivering the world&#039;s largest sporting spectacular event, the Olympic Games, in 2012 and boosting its sporting profile worldwide. The eyes of the world will be monitoring our preparations to a greater or lesser degree from today until the summer of 2012. I take this opportunity to congratulate my noble friend Lord Coe, his team, Tessa Jowell, the DCMS team, and all those involved, on their achievement in winning the nomination for Britain.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>The Bill we are discussing today, and throughout its progress, is essentially a stepping stone to enable a successful delivery of this event. I want to make it clear at this stage that we on this side of your Lordships&#039; House have the same objective as Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#151;to deliver the most successful, friendly and financially beneficial Olympic Games yet run. Our objective in these debates will be to improve the Bill and in no way to destroy or damage it.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>The Bill as it appears in this House is fundamentally sound, but there are a few concerns I should like to raise. Most of these were also raised by my honourable friend Hugh Robertson in another place, so they will come as no surprise to the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>There is the issue of accountability to Parliament. The London 2012 Games is a national event and should not be made into an unnecessarily political one. The ODA and other Olympic bodies are accountable through the Secretary of State to Parliament, but Parliament must maintain accessibility to this process. I suggest that an annual update of progress, issues and costs, with an opportunity to debate outstanding or new concerns, would be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>There is a very real prospect of a considerable economic boost for sport and tourism across the country. Ours was a bid for the Games that will reach beyond the closing ceremony and we must deliver on that for the regeneration of the Lea Valley, the new world-class venues for sport, the boost to tourism and a heightened passion for sporting achievement at all levels.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>There is also the issue of partnership. I have already mentioned that we wish to maintain a cross-party consensus, something particularly pertinent when considering the extensive powers that the Bill grants to the Mayor of London. The powers are unprecedented and, therefore, potentially dangerous and controversial. To deliver a project of this size and scale, we accept that he will need to have extraordinary powers, but under the Bill he could decide, for example, to buy compulsorily the Centre Court at Wimbledon. Therefore, will the Minister look at how those boundaries might be policed? The Mayor has been known to push at the boundaries of his power <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_254"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 254</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and it is essential that in no circumstances should he be allowed to use the Olympics as a pretext to exercise powers that are not explicitly and directly related to the Olympic Games of 2012. It is vital that the Mayor works in close partnership with the ODA and the boroughs and that they endeavour to achieve their targets without resorting to unnecessary force or bullying.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>London 2012 has to be a Games for the athletes, run and supported not just by the Government but also by the Opposition parties, whoever they may be. The fact that London is hosting the Games is sure, but although we expect to be in power in 2012, that is not sure.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>That brings me to the costs and who will cover any overrun should there be any. That problem has been widely debated in the national press. The memorandum of understanding signed by the Government in 2003 clearly puts the responsibility on the National Lottery and the London council tax payers. There is a real possibility, given the history of other Games, that the 2012 Games will cost more than has been budgeted for. It is said that Sydney and Athens ran far more than 100 per cent overspends, although the new good news is that LOCOG is anticipating a surplus for 2012. In the event of a deficit, why should Londoners be expected to pay for any cost overrun for this national event?
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>The Government and the Mayor have agreed a funding package of up to &#163;2.375 billion to meet the cost of staging the Games, including support for elite support and associated sports investments. That includes &#163;1.2 billion in contingency. I suggest that it is vital that the nation understands how that money is spent and how much goes into long-term infrastructure, housing, sporting, transport and other things. We need more clarity about the proposed final cost allocations. There is considerable concern among sports governing bodies regarding the importance of financing their seven-year plans on the road to London 2012. I very much hope that that issue will be revisited in the course of the debate.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>If we are to move from 10th in the medal table to the aspirational target of fourth, announced by the British Olympic Association, it is vital that our young Olympians of tomorrow are able to rely on the finest coaches and support services in the world. I hope that the absence of eagerly awaited funding from the Pre-Budget Statement of the Chancellor will not be paralleled by a similar lack of initiative and action on behalf of our sports people in the Olympic Bill. I seek the Minister&#039;s assurance that we shall not have to wait until the next Budget before our sports governing bodies are adequately financed for the task in hand.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>We hold very real concerns about the draconian constraints to the advertising industry. The Bill sets out powers to protect the Games from unauthorised commercial exploitation and ambush marketing. While that is understandable, when considering the sums of revenue that need to be raised by LOCOG and the need to maintain the value of the advertising and merchandising to LOCOG&#039;s top sponsors, I believe that the timeframe and the restrictive nature of the Bill remain overzealous.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60111-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>These restrictions are set to be in place a matter of months after the Bill is passed and continue for the next six and a half years. The Sydney Games only put such measures in place four years in advance, is it therefore strictly necessary for London to impose them for an additional two and a half years?
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>We are also concerned about the presumption of guilt in this regard and the proposed legislation goes far further on this agenda than the IOC recommends&#151;why? Will Her Majesty&#039;s Government give the House an undertaking that they will give greater clarity on all these issues to those affected by advertising restrictions within a time frame that they, the marketeers and advertisers, can work to. We are aware of the huge costs in time and money that are incurred in advertising and marketing programmes. We must give businesses adequate protection and guidance in good time if we are to retain their good will.

<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>I am also concerned that the Secretary of State has the power to change the prohibited &quot;words&quot; at any time by affirmative order. That creates a risk of some advertisements being pre-vetted and allowed airtime and space under one set of rules, and subsequently found to be illegal by a second set of rules. Will Her Majesty&#039;s Government assure us that this matter will be addressed and clarified, especially in Schedule 4 to the Bill?
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>While the Bill goes to great lengths to protect the London Olympics from over exuberant advertising, it goes to no lengths at all to monitor or control gambling in relation to the Games, which can, it has been seen in recent weeks, threaten the integrity of sport. I seek acknowledgement of this issue from Her Majesty&#039;s Government and ask the Minister to inform us how this potential problem might be addressed.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>I now raise the small but very important issue of compensation for the businesses in the lower Lea Valley. There are a group of 284 businesses&#151;although I read in my newspaper a few days ago that there were 300 claimants&#151;all of whom stand to lose business from re-location. I understand that the compensation they are being offered is allocated on a pre-bid land value basis. However, they will have to purchase on a post-bid basis when the market will have changed dramatically. Added to this is the inconvenience of re-locating. We feel that this is not being handled fairly or well by Her Majesty&#039;s Government. They will tell me that it is up to the Mayor, but I do not accept that. The ODA must win the support of the nation and must not appear to be a &quot;bully&quot;. The Minister must re-assess the manner and values in which sensitive issues of compulsory purchasing are approached.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>The Minister mentioned security. I fear that the euphoria of winning the bid will forever be linked with the disbelief and horror of the terrorist attacks which took place less than 24 hours later. It is something of a surprise that there is no mention of security provisions in the Bill and I ask the Minister to clarify the Government&#039;s position on this, and how they see the additional costs of security in 2012 being covered.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>Then there is the issue of tax&#151;the tax take on the Olympic lottery game. If the expected value of money to go to the Olympics through the lottery is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_256"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 256</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;750 million, the total sales from the Olympic lottery games will be &#163;2,680 million. This means that the total amount taken by the Government in lottery tax duty will be &#163;321 million. Surely that says something about the Chancellor&#039;s attitude to the games. The tax should be returned to LOCOG forthwith.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>Lastly, let us turn to the reforming of the structure for the provision of grass roots sports. This needs a radical overhaul in order to develop and find future generations of gold medallists. I have drawn attention in various debates on sport in your Lordships&#039; House to the ridiculous level of bureaucracy which hampers the progress of our sports clubs; now is the time to re-structure for the 22nd century the bureaucratic management of sport in this country. My noble friend Lord Moynihan and Kate Hoey in their excellent report <i>Raising the Bar</i> go a long way to suggest how this might be done. This is a Games for elite athletes at the highest level, but its scope and impetus must be carried forward and used to deliver on the wider sports agenda.
</p>

<a name="60111-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>We have before us the opportunity to achieve a unique and remarkable sporting celebration, but we need to get it right from the start. Seven years is not a long time; however, I am sure that with continued cross-party support and accountability we will deliver.

<a name="60111-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his introduction. I, too, wish to associate myself and the Liberal Democrat Benches with the tributes to and comments on Tony Banks&#151;Lord Stratford&#151;from the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. All sides of the House and the general public are much poorer for his sad, sudden death. He was a true Londoner and a great supporter of sport in this country; our debate is a fitting time to mention him with enormous affection.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>We have truly all been waiting with some anticipation for this Bill, not only today but on a previous day. It is a pity&#151;although I dare say he may not have had the patience to wait&#151;that the noble Lord, Lord Coe, is not in the Chamber to receive personal congratulations. Gaining the Olympics for London was a massive achievement; the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State, and all those involved deserve great credit for having secured them. I saw a rerun of the announcement in Singapore not long ago, at the CBI dinner, and again at the &quot;Sports Personality of the Year&quot; awards on the BBC. It is very watchable, isn&#039;t it? I could keep rerunning that tape for quite some time.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>On the Liberal Democrat Benches, and in my party generally, we strongly support the Olympics as a huge potential boost for London&#039;s economy and infrastructure&#151;and a positive impact on sports generally in the UK. However, we also want to ensure that expenditure incurred on the Olympics will give us the promised payback in terms of regeneration, tourism and economic legacy. It is also crucial for the overall success of the Games that they are delivered on budget, and we want to ensure that that benefit for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_257"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 257</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

London is not outweighed by detriment for the rest of the country. The recently reported PwC study was positive about the potential for London and the rest of the country, but only if the Government make the right interventions.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>A number of provisions in the Bill give rise to issues around general arrangements being made for the Olympics. First, there is the council tax bill for Londoners. Although the Government state, in the bid documentation, that they are the ultimate guarantor of the cost of the Games, it is far from clear how that operates. Indeed, it appears that Londoners are the real guarantors since, despite the best efforts of my honourable friend Don Foster and the Conservative Front Bench in the other place, there is no cap on council tax for Londoners in the Bill. That is no theoretical issue; the <i>Observer</i> reported on 20 November that the projected costs have surged because original projections allowed for inflation at 3 per cent, yet inflation in the construction sector is now over 7 per cent per annum. It appears that KPMG has been appointed to re-appraise the costs. Can the Minister comment on that? What is its remit and when is it expected to report?
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>The Mayor himself seems to have started with an original calculation for the Olympics precept of &#163;20 per head, per year, for 10 to 12 years&#151;the walnut whip, as he described it. The expected bill seems in fact to be over &#163;40 per year for a great many households above band D&#151;and that is on current costs alone. The <i>Observer</i> article quotes an additional possible cost of an extra &#163;1,000 per household over the period. Is that scaremongering, or a reasonable supposition? Can the Minister comment on the true figure?
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>We have seen the concern of the Secretary of State over the increased estimated cost for the London aquatic centre, so this cannot just be an illusion; it is a real issue. It is not right that Londoners should have to foot all the additional costs. Will the Government undertake to limit the liability of the London council tax payer?
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a> Secondly, there is the issue of lottery funding. As part of the funding package, Camelot has been asked by the DCMS to raise some &#163;750 million from games through the national lottery to support the Olympics between now and 2012, with a further &#163;410 million to come from existing good causes from January 2009 and &#163;340 million from sports lottery distributors for elite sport and associated sports infrastructure investment. The &quot;go for gold&quot; scratchcard has already raised several million pounds, but I am concerned about a major diversion of money from other causes. The Big Lottery Fund, which distributes lottery money, has predicted that grants may be reduced by some &#163;68 million over the next four years, as lottery players switch to the games that support the Olympics. An impact assessment, which was published some two years ago, suggested that the cannibalisation rate from existing good causes could be some 59 per cent&#151;that is, &#163;445 million&#151;over the period to 2012, which equates to some &#163;64 million per annum, which is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_258"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 258</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

fairly similar figure. The Government expect that non-Olympic good causes will receive up to 10 per cent less in lottery income over the period from 2005 to 2013.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Action should therefore be taken to limit the impact of the Olympic lottery. Camelot has called for the introduction of a gross profits tax regime, whereby tax is paid after rather than before prizes have been paid to players, which would allow Camelot to increase prize payouts on selected lottery products, thereby stimulating sales growth. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report estimated that the annual opportunity cost of delaying a migration from lottery duty to a GPT regime equates to lost revenues of some &#163;50 million to good causes, and &#163;15 million to the Exchequer. Clearly, GPT would help Camelot to maximise revenues, both for the Olympics and other good causes. The Treasury acknowledges that the economic case for change has been made; the deregulated gambling and gaming sectors have already made that transition. Yet in the pre-Budget announcement before Christmas, the Government set their face against any change. Therefore, what are the Government doing to ensure that the impact of the Olympic lottery is minimised? Why are they not implementing a GPT regime?
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>We then come to the whole issue of advertising. The rights of official sponsors of the Olympics must be clearly given due protection, and the Olympics brand should, of course, be fully protected from unauthorised exploitation&#151;and, indeed, we are obliged to do that by the host city contract with the IOC. However, the Bill, and in particularly Schedule 4, contains some disproportionately restrictive clauses, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, pointed out, which are beyond what is laid down in the IOC technical manual or the host city contract.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>I have compared the legislation used for the Sydney Olympics and, by comparison, the London Olympic association right runs far too wide. The Sydney legislation ties the list of words to the use of the word Olympic, or similar; in addition, it is clear that there must be commercial use that is designed to give a misleading impression of sponsorship. As presently drafted, the legitimate tourist trade&#151;hotels, travel agents and so on&#151;will be penalised for trying to encourage guests to come to London during the Olympics, when we should be seeking, on the contrary, to encourage their involvement and support.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>I am particularly alarmed by the automatic presumption of guilt which is contained in the Bill; there is no justification in this instance for reversing the normal presumption of innocence used in our courts, and that is not contained in the Sydney legislation. The IOC did not require of the UK Government a reverse burden of proof to be included in the implementing legislation; that is unnecessary gold-plating, and it is not enough simply to say that the presumption is relatively light&#151;it is not. However, I welcome LOCOG&#039;s recent assurance that it will produce guidelines for advertisers about what in practice could lead to prosecution for breach of the right. But many questions need answering on that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_259"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

front: who will be consulted in drafting such guidelines, and what arrangements will there be for copy clearance?
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>There are other problems with Schedule 4. There is the whole issue of the exemption for publishers and broadcasters contained in paragraph 8(a), when the use of an association is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;a necessary incident of publishing or broadcasting a report of a sporting or other event forming part of the London Olympics&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>&quot;Necessary&quot; suggests a high test for editors to comply with. How would this be enforced by LOCOG? Surely it is not for LOCOG to interfere with editorial freedom of expression by policing what falls to be considered a &quot;necessary&quot; incident or not. I believe this should be replaced by a more editorial-friendly test, such as the one tabled by my honourable friend, Don Foster, in the other place, that the London Olympics association right is not infringed by the use of a representation in any editorial usage, and so on. This would also ensure that websites were covered.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Then there is the issue, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, of when the association right is due to come into effect. The Sydney legislation provided for this to come into effect four years before the Olympics. This Bill introduces restrictions immediately on the passage of the Bill&#151;that is, six and a half years beforehand. Advertisements take a number of months in the planning and execution, during which time significant amounts of money are spent. The immediate introduction of the London Olympics association right could mean that an advertiser would be guilty of an offence.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The Government have admitted that it is unlikely that there will be many infringing advertisements in the period after Royal Assent so far ahead of the Games, yet they say that LOCOG, unlike any previous organising committee, needs to protect its right during this period. In fact, legislation already exists to enable LOCOG to prevent false association with the Games, including the Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act, copyright and trademark law, the law of passing off, and the misleading advertisements regulations. Other organising bodies, for the Turin, Beijing and Vancouver Games, have met or exceeded their marketing revenue budgets without introducing similar legislation, and the IOC has reported that it has already signed up six out of a potential 10 multinational sponsors for the Games. So why should there be a problem in getting sponsors? The Government have said that a light-touch approach will be taken, but advertisers are already receiving threatening letters. Clearly the Government should delay implementation of Schedule 4 until 1 January 2008.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>Then there is the issue of the Secretary of State&#039;s power to change the words, which are the subject of a London Olympic association right. At the very least we will seek changes in Committee that will make statutory the Government&#039;s assurances that they will consult the advertising industry before making changes. It is not good enough simply to rely on the fact that the changes are required to be made by affirmative order. Furthermore, what assurance can <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_260"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 260</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Minister give that any changes would not be applied retrospectively? Campaigns already in production, or that have been approved by the BACC, should not have to be altered. The new rules should of course only apply to new campaigns not yet in production.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>It is crucial that, in achieving delivery, there are good communications between the various bodies set up or involved in delivery of the Games, and proper lines of accountability. In Committee, we will be probing why certain bodies are not represented on the Olympics board or will not be included in the list of consultees for the Olympic transport plan, and so on&#151;for example, the members of the London co-ordination working group. There are a number of issues there that I will not go into in great detail. My noble friend Lord Addington will be dealing with many of the disability issues that arise in the Bill and the arrangements for them.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>I shall talk briefly about the tourism potential of the 2012 Olympics. It is enormous. The benefits are estimated at some &#163;2 billion to the UK visitor economy. Some 500,000 additional visitors are expected in 2012, and an increase in the number of international business events is also anticipated. We hope that the Games will prove a long-term boost to tourism. The London Olympics represent the opportunity of a generation for the tourism industry. The hopeful benefits are by no means a given, however. What are the Government doing to ensure that the required leadership resources and pre-planning are in place to create the Olympics legacy for tourism? I would like to hear from the Minister that there will be sufficient funding for this task. We appear to have no commitment from the Government to invest more in tourism in the run-up to the Games. My noble friend Lady Hamwee will be raising a number of transport concerns, and I leave these in her far more expert hands.
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>Finally, there is of course the question of support for British athletes. Mr Caborn and the Secretary of State say that everything will be alright on the night, but that is not the message coming through from the British sporting community. What assurances can the Minister give about the funding of athletes?
</p>

<a name="60111-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>I confirm that we on these Benches are extremely enthusiastic about the Olympics. We want to see this Bill go through quickly and I hope that the Government will make the few changes that are necessary to make it fully satisfactory. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#039;s winding-up speech.

<a name="60111-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Valentine: </b>   My Lords, it is an extraordinary and unexpected privilege to find myself in your Lordships&#039; House. I have been made to feel most welcome and look forward to becoming, dare I say, one of the younger members of the team. And team spirit is what we need for the Olympics. It is what delivered us the bid and will deliver the best Games yet.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para0"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 261</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

business organisation London First, provides me and my colleagues with wise, prompt and good humoured advice. As chief executive of London First, I am a huge supporter of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games. We have a real chance in the United Kingdom to make these the best Games ever held. But more than that, we have the opportunity to make a positive impact on the capital, and the rest of the UK, by securing a lasting Olympic dividend.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>My commitment to athletics stems from my school days when I was once long-jump champion for London. I well remember that surge of energy before rushing off down the track in a bid to do better than all those who had come before. The UK is in that position now. The bid team has got us off to a flying start, and has handed over the baton smoothly to the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, which has put the team in a strong position to create an Olympics of which to be proud. Recently the International Olympic Committee visited London and felt we were some two years ahead of where previous host cities had been at a similar stage. So we have started well.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>The preparatory work over the coming months must pave the way not just for a superb Olympic event but for a permanent change to the spirit, physical fabric and economic structure of east London. This is what I referred to a moment ago as the Olympic dividend. And, as I learnt from my time in corporate finance at Barings and BOC, as well as making good investments you need to work hard to maximise their potential.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>The region in which the Olympics are to take place includes some of the most deprived councils in England. It is host to a young, diverse, socially and economically disadvantaged population whose prospects could be transformed as a result of these games taking place on their doorstep. There will be more jobs&#151;recent estimates suggest some 38,000&#151;more homes and better transport, resulting in a more healthy and prosperous population.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>We must all support the Olympic Development Authority in creating the infrastructure for these Games. I am delighted that it is to be business-led and the recent appointments have been welcomed by the business community. It needs to be allowed to get on with doing the job without day-to-day interference; and to achieve that requires clear political direction&#151;someone or something that plainly speaks on behalf of all arms of government.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>But the Olympic dividend requires more than just the Olympic Development Authority. Government, the mayor and business will continue after the ODA has completed its task; and they share the responsibility of providing opportunities for the people of east London. The plethora of well intentioned initiatives to provide skills training and education enhancement arising from the Olympics must be effectively co-ordinated to that the people to whom these are directed genuinely benefit.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_262"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 262</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>In the late 1980s I set up a regeneration partnership in Blackburn, Lancashire, working with local businesses and the Asian community there, which taught me the importance of working with the people you are trying to help, to ensure that programmes intended for their benefit actually address their needs. The current review of the Mayor&#039;s powers, including skills leadership, provides the opportunity to debate how best we collectively deliver for east Londoners. It is vital that business plays its full part in any structure in informing the training and education, in providing pragmatic leadership and, ultimately, employing the individuals.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>The speed at which the Bill has progressed and the decisions that have already been taken to drive forward transport projects, such as the East London Line extension, with its innovative commitment to employing local labour, and the completion of the northern ticketing hall at King&#039;s Cross, are impressive. I would like, in particular, to recognise the way in which the Olympic boroughs have come together to resolve highly complex planning issues. I understand that they intend to continue this level of co-operation throughout the run-up to the Games.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>Lastly, as a former National Lottery Commissioner, I am pleased to say that the National Lottery was so confident that we would win that Olympic scratchcards were printed and ready to distribute on the day of the decision. To date, more than &#163;3 million has been raised by the National Lottery. This combination of belief and preparation should characterise our delivery of the 2012 Games. It is the combination that generates the surge of energy required to excel and surpass all Olympiads that have gone before.

<a name="60111-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Pendry: </b>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow the maiden speech of the young noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. I am sure this House will recognise that she has spoken with great knowledge about the importance of the Games and how they will affect London. She clearly has first-class qualifications to speak in this debate with her background in both the Central London Partnership and, indeed, London First. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Coe, and his team will take note of what she has said tonight and that they will benefit from her wise words, as I am sure we all will in future debates.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>Before embarking on my speech, I want to add my words to the tributes that have already been paid to the late Lord Stratford, who died last week. I had known him for many years in the other place, and his love of sport and animal welfare were legend. Of course, for a brief period he was Minister for Sport. It is somewhat ironic that I was at Stamford Bridge on Saturday at his beloved Chelsea, where I was hoping to see him, when the dreadful news came through of his stroke in Florida. Lord Stratford, or Tony Banks as he was better known, came to this House with a reputation for being with my noble friend Lord Snape the wittiest pair to come from the other place in many a long year. He would, I am sure, have made an inspiring speech <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_263"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 263</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

today in the debate, which, as he told me before the Recess, as he did the Minister, he was eagerly awaiting, especially as the 2012 Olympics would have done much in the area of Stratford. I simply repeat what others have said: he will be greatly missed.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>We are privileged indeed to have the opportunity to debate this important piece of legislation. Were it not for the heroic work of the London 2012 bid team, to whom I pay tribute, the legislation would not have seen the light of day. We all recognise the great efforts of the noble Lord, Lord Coe, on behalf of the country to ensure that this most prestigious of events will be staged in the UK again. I certainly congratulate him, as others have done, on the Sports Personality award that he won and, since then, on the honour that he received in the New Year Honours List as well. I am sure that there are many more accolades to come. However, perhaps the best award that he could hope to receive is a London Olympics, which is every bit as magical as the proposals which won over the IOC delegates in July.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, I chair the All-Party Sports Group, and we are of course a cross-party group. As I have said before, in my view, many issues in sport are best addressed across the parties, and this bid was a good example of all sides pulling together. We must continue to do so to ensure that this country delivers an Olympics of which we can all be proud.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>We will certainly have the world-class venues to accommodate the Games. I have spoken previously in this Chamber to exalt the virtues of these venues, including Wembley&#151;when it is finally finished&#151;Wimbledon, Lord&#039;s, the Dome and the ExCel Centre, and we can add to those the Olympic Park Stadium and others. Therefore, we will be in a position not only to deliver a superb Olympics but also to regenerate east London and leave a legacy of quality facilities for our future athletes in years to come.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>I will now touch on some specific issues relating to this Bill, perhaps returning to them in Committee. The first is that of betting on the Olympics, especially when the games are staged in London. The IOC is of course concerned to protect the Games from any risk to their integrity from betting. I raised this issue in March when the Gambling Bill was passing through this place and sought to table an amendment which would have given sport more of a chance to control the betting on it. At that time I received a letter from Hein Verbruggen, who was then the acting president of the General Association of International Sports Federations. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;The impact of increasing betting activity is a very important issue to my organisation and to sport in general. I would like to express my support for your amendment and for your efforts to ensure that sport is able to protect its rights and means to ensure the integrity of sporting events&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>I understand that the IOC has required, in its agreement with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, that all steps will be taken to control betting on the Olympic Games. Surely the Government&#151;who have committed to support the commitments made by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games by introducing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_264"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 264</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation&#151;should address this issue in the Bill. How has this been taken forward? Is this issue to be addressed in the Bill itself? Will any betting business looking to offer a bet on the London Games have to enter into an agreement with LOCOG under the Olympic Association right? This would seem to be the right approach. I would be grateful if the Minister could write to me on this issue, and perhaps place a copy of the commitment that has been made to the IOC in the Library.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>Clause 31 proposes measures to tackle the sale of tickets, which has been referred to already, for any London Olympics event by anyone other than the officially authorised vendor. This measure is specifically required by the IOC and formed part of our contract when we won the bid. The proposals, which the Minister has already referred to, deal with what is commonly known as ticket touting. The proposals are welcome and cover a whole range of areas exploited by touts including the sale of tickets through Internet sites such as eBay. Your Lordships may not be aware that this is an issue which has long troubled the sporting world. It is a growing problem which is spreading to other ticketed events such as concerts, leading to ordinary consumers being forced to pay extraordinary amounts for their tickets. This has a very negative impact as it limits access to sporting events by younger people and sports fans who do not have deep pockets. The Olympics will inspire a generation to take part and watch sport, but we must ensure that they can actually afford to go to events.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>Touting is an activity which frequently operates outside the law, contravening rules and regulations set down by event organisers and public authorities. Consumer protection regulations are ignored and at times tickets are often stolen, forged or mis-sold. It also impacts on public finances, with no VAT or corporation tax being paid and additional costs as a result of increased public order offence levels outside venues.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>Your Lordships will remember that ticket touting was a significant concern for football and a cause of football hooliganism in the 1970s and 1980s. I supported the then Conservative government when they introduced a law to deal with touting in football and took a further step in making a commitment to tackle touting across sport as part of our 1997 manifesto for sports, <i>Labour&#039;s Sporting Nation</i>. The Government have yet to deliver on this pledge. As things stand, we will be left with the curious situation in which it will be illegal for ticket touting to take place for the Olympic archery at Lord&#039;s, but not for Ashes cricket at the same venue. I am aware that the Secretary of State has engaged with a number of event organisers and sports governing bodies, such as the ECB, the RFU and the LTA, to assess this problem. I was pleased that the Minister said that the Government were looking at the issue beyond the Olympics.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>Finally, I shall touch briefly on concerns, which remain despite the degree of assurance from the Government in the other place, about the extent to which the Bill will encroach on advertising and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_265"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 265</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

marketing around the period of the 2012 Games. I understand and agree with the need to protect the Olympic symbols. Indeed, I was instrumental in bringing in the Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act some years ago. However, with copyright and trademark law, there is arguably enough legislation in place already to prevent the misuse of Olympic symbols and a belief among advertisers that any new layer of regulation would go beyond what is necessary. We must take care that these protections are set in place in a manner which does not encroach on legitimate activity of businesses in London and the UK, notably the introduction of a new intellectual property right. The London Olympics Association has said that it is necessary to keep within the spirit of the IOC agreement, and of course it is, but there is also alarm at the speed with which the Government intend to introduce these new measures.
</p>

<a name="60111-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>It is frightening that I sometimes have to agree with my colleagues on the other side of the House&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, in particular&#151;but I certainly do on this issue. I applaud the principles that lie behind these aspects of the Bill. They seek to protect and therefore to help recruit the official sponsors who will provide the financial commitment that will be so important to the success of London&#039;s Games. However, it is important to recognise that the summer Games in Beijing in 2008, as well as the winter events that are scheduled to take place in Turin and Vancouver in 2006 and 2010 respectively, have each exceeded their targets for generating marketing income without the additional measures that the Government are proposing. So I welcome, as I am sure would the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, a government commitment to meet representatives of the advertising sector to review these issues. I hope that they will be addressed at a later stage in Committee.

<a name="60111-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, I join the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, in congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, on her maiden speech. One of the advantages of having an appointed as well as an elected Chamber in Parliament is that we can get expertise such as hers to play an important role in our business. I am particularly glad that this debate is taking place this evening since, after the delay before Christmas, I wondered whether the more stringent rule of &quot;two false starts and you&#039;re out&quot; now applied.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>I am absolutely delighted that the London bid for the Olympics in 2012 was successful. I am particularly glad that the effort of the noble Lord, Lord Coe, in this respect was recognised, among other ways, in the New Year honours list. The team put in a quite remarkable sprint towards the end, and I hope that the country, London and sporting community will gain from the fact that we are to hold the Olympics in 2012 in London.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>It is rather worrying in a way that it is well over half a century since I marched round in the opening ceremony of the 1948 Olympics at Wembley, together, I believe, with the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_266"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 266</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

As was shown by a recent film which appeared on television entitled &quot;A Very British Olympics&quot;, those Games were a great success and conducted under very difficult conditions as the Minister pointed out. Food was still rationed. To avoid complaints, the American team received unlimited supplies of steak and probably consumed more in a week than the annual meat ration at the time. I was doing my national service in the Air Force and I got an extra pint of milk a week&#151;the main advantage of which was that it enabled me to go to the front of the queue in the cookhouse.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>We have a very important occasion in front of us, and I join my noble friend and all noble Lords who have spoken in supporting the Bill. None the less, we will need to scrutinise it carefully. The Olympic Games are now an enormous event&#151;in some ways perhaps too large. Despite the noble Baroness who just waved to me across the Chamber, I am not at all sure that it is a good idea to have tennis included. I have a strong feeling that if one were to inquire whether a tennis player would rather win Wimbledon or Olympic tennis, the choice would be in favour of Wimbledon.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>The scale of the Games is enormous and attention has rightly been drawn to the question of costs. We need to scrutinise them very carefully. No doubt we will wish to do so in Committee. Concern has also been expressed about advertising, and I have also received representations about the environmental effect on some parts of east London. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has raised a question that had not been raised so far and the Minister may like to respond to it. It points out that Clause 20(4) disapplies the hybrid instrument procedures from the regulations, and the House may wish to question why, in the light of disapplication, organisations representing those affected by the regulations have not been included among those required to be consulted on their content. It seems appropriate that they are consulted in the preparation of such orders.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>Following the tragedy in Munich and subsequent terrorist attacks, I share the concern of my noble friend that security seems to have been dealt with very briefly. There is no more than a passing mention in the Bill. Perhaps we should consider to what extent any special provisions may be necessary.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>In my remaining remarks I shall concentrate on transport. It seemed to me that one of the main reasons why we might not win the bid was that London transport is so bad; and that the main case for getting transport in London improved was to win the Olympic bid. We can already see some improvements coming through as a result of the bid, in particular in the Jubilee line. I am more doubtful about the Docklands Light Railway. The carriages are very short and there are far too many stops. On the other hand it is probably difficult to get a train to go straight from the City to the Olympic venue if normal traffic is operating at the same time.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>Another thing that worries me is that we will need to have contingency plans. A few weeks ago, a bus caught fire in a tunnel in Docklands on a Sunday. It was, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_267"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 267</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I think, more than a week before the tunnel was put right and meanwhile traffic in south London was in chaos. It took me more than two hours to go seven miles from Blackheath&#151;and then I had to pay the congestion charge at the end of it. Had that minor accident&#151;just one bus catching fire in the tunnel&#151;happened in the middle of the Olympics, it would have totally disrupted the transport arrangements. That is something that we will need to cater for in our preparations.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>The other thing that worries me is the role of the Mayor and the relationship of his role to the delivery authority and the Secretary of State. I recall that when the IOC was initially visiting London to look at the arrangements that might be made here, action by the Mayor jeopardised or was in danger of jeopardising the case we were trying to put forward. As far as transport is concerned, other than reducing two-lane roads in London to single lanes and the constant introduction of more traffic lights and bendy buses&#151;which themselves have had problems&#151;it seems to me that he is not the ideal person, to put it no more strongly than that, to be responsible for improving transport in the context of the Olympic Games. So I think that we will need to look in Committee at the extent to which the Mayor has powers. He is inevitably involved in the contract, but at the same time he appears to have a veto&#151;and a veto as far as the Secretary of State is concerned&#151;with regard to some of the issues that are obviously important if the matters with which we are concerned in the Bill are to be carried through successfully.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>An event such as an Olympics in any particular country has a tremendous influence on raising enthusiasm for sports generally. Fortunately we have got away from the politically correct view some years ago that competitive sport was a bad and dangerous thing. But there is a problem as a result of the professionalism now. Alas, the old amateur concept of the Olympics has long since disappeared and we concentrate more and more on elite athletes. The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, referred to the finance for athletes&#039; training. There is now a gap, certainly as far as athletics is concerned, between the progress from school to club and then to international competition. In fact, the standard, allowing for the improvement in tracks and so on, is not greatly better at club level than it used to be 50 years ago. At times they are somewhat better but they are not enormously better at that level. People therefore have to make a huge jump from being a good club athlete to joining the international elite. That is something we will need to consider carefully if we are, as I hope we will, not only stage a very successful Olympic Games but also as a country produce athletes who will have a good result competing in those games.

up. I have been one the younger Members of this House for nearly 20 years. You can enjoy being that for a while here.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>I am glad we are discussing this Bill. It was a hark back to teenage years when it was announced on the TV and I found myself jumping up and down&#151;and thinking that this was rather an undignified way to behave. It was a wonderful moment. We have an opportunity to go on and create something which will leave a wonderful imprint on the mind and the imagination of people for a long period in the future. Yet one of the reasons that we won it is rather more mundane: it gave us the chance to focus on and regenerate a part of our major capital city that would probably not have happened otherwise. One of the major groups involved includes those who provide the recruitment bases for athletes for the Paralympic Games. It is important that it is the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Davies, has been warmed up to this in the experience of the last DDA Bill and the hours of fun we had on that. I hope that he will take in that we must concentrate on getting the disability access, the planning and the structure right. We will do that by getting the expertise in early, making sure that we are not having to chase around afterwards adapting buildings, structures and transport links after they are half-completed. What is in place in the structure and recruitment of the expertise to get that done? The thing about disability access and structure is that there is no one disability. It is something of a truism and I have said it far too often in this Chamber, but everyone thinks of a wheelchair. Then people have a little struggle and think, &quot;Oh, what about the blind and people with visual impairment?&quot;. Then they work back over a great deal of time bumping into problems, saying, &quot;That group as well? Oh, yes&quot;. In the realisation of this and the opportunity of the commission we had an advisory panel to tell people about the different types of disability, how they can act, what is needed and what seems to bring them in. I hope that the Government will be able to tell us and show us in fairly short order where the structures are for getting those bits right and from where the expertise is going to come. If they do, they stand an incredibly improved chance of ensuring that they will not be chasing their tail and making corrections later on.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>People may think that this is not a big part of the project, but the Olympic village, for example, will presumably be the same village for the Paralympics. That will be a huge amount of accessible housing in the middle of London that can be used afterwards for anyone. It will be housing which, if we get this right, will already be available for the vast majority of people with disabilities to use&#151;independent living projects. I suggest that that is a massive bonus. We will have improved access on all the transport links. That is a massive bonus.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>We also know from experience that that does not just help the disabled. It must be getting on for 15 years ago that I first pointed out that a ramp does not just help someone in a wheelchair; it helps a mother with <br>&nbsp;<br>

a pram&#151;that was the first example that I used. Now, everyone who has a suitcase seems to have one on wheels; it will help anyway with a heavy suitcase. I could carry on. That will help everyone.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Davies, and I remember the issues well. Let us consider signing on trains and announcement systems. We have had hours of fun on that before. Do not tell me that having announcements made clearly and signs put up clearly will not help tourists. That will help everyone but that makes it possible for other sections of society to use. From where are the Government recruiting the expertise to allow that to happen? If the Minister can give me an answer today, or at least give me assurances that he will give them to me before we table amendments for Committee, I assure him that I shall not bother him further&#151;or, at least, that I shall bother him less than I otherwise would.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>Let us face it, my attitude towards the Games is that they are a wonderful thing. If the Government are getting it right, let us go on with it and back them. I do not want to waste my time or anyone else&#039;s fighting battles that will be won. If we get the assurances, I shall not table more amendments just to go through the motions and the ritual dance. The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, put it clearly: this has enjoyed a degree of cross-party co-operation from which many other fields would benefit, but from which we often chicken out at the last minute. This could be an area on which we agree. Disability legislation is another field where a degree of cross-party consensus can be achieved, with or without the ritual dance.
</p>

<a name="60111-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>I finish by saying: tell us where the information, the structure and the planning is. Tell us who you have contacted and what is the consultation and then we can leave it alone. If you cannot, we must return to it.

I am sure that she will already have gathered that we regularly have debates on sport in this House. The people she has heard today are an illustration of the distinguished people we have here. We have Olympians; we have people who have been involved in sport for many years; we have powerful voices in sport. In fact, I like to think that this is a really top team; an elite squad in itself.

<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>Let us look back to 6 July. As has already been said, it was a moment that is frozen in time. It was a seemingly endless moment between the opening of the envelope and the magical announcement, &quot;And the chosen city is&#151;London&quot;. How we cheered, how we leapt&#151;some higher than others&#151;and how we wiped away a tear or two. The nation celebrated all the sweeter for it being that little bit unexpected. Tonight, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_270"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 270</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we take on in this House the responsibility of ensuring that those magical moments of aspiration are converted into solid strategies for realising them.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>The Bill before us today is the blueprint. It sets out the structure for managing the key facets of the Games, the management planning and the financial investment that is essential if we are to be successful. The background to the Bill indicates the Government&#039;s determination to create what has been described as &quot;the greatest stage ever constructed for the greatest show on Earth&quot;. Drawing on expertise worldwide, the DCMS has formulated the Bill after the closest possible co-operation with key players. They have already been mentioned: the British Olympic Association, London 2012 Limited and the Greater London Authority. Those major agencies have brought to the table a huge pool of experience and expertise and the resultant Bill is, in my view, due in no small part to their professionalism and commitment.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>But whilst the British people have a warm heart in favour of staging the Olympics here in the UK after, as we have already been reminded, so many years, they also have a cold eye on delivery and cost&#151;and quite right too. The Games have to be properly organised; they must be delivered on time&#151;and, in my view, well before time in order to detect any flaws&#151;and costs have to be not only controlled but realistic. Bearing all that in mind, we welcome the role of the Olympic Delivery Agency, the ODA, as set out in the Bill. It is charged with the responsibility of managing our approach to the Games.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>It has a huge challenge before it, balancing the long-term objective against the short-term delivery vehicle. At the same time it has to take, in that vehicle, public opinion, media challenges and national confidence. All those challenges have to be faced across the whole of the UK, not just in London where the Games will be principally staged.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>We in this House do not have constituencies to promote as Members of the other place clearly have. They quite rightly seek to ensure that where possible and reasonable their neck of the woods receives a fair share of the opportunity afforded by the Games. That fair share may be prior to the Games in training facilities, during the Games with specific sports being hosted in their area, and, equally important to their region, benefiting from the legacy of the Games.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>However, we in this House have strong ties and we should not be reluctant to make the case for dispersal of the opportunity that the Games can afford. I have to say that I unblushingly suggest that Corby be considered as a wholly appropriate venue for any stages of the Games that are set out. Yes, I confirm that I chair the URC, Catalyst Corby, and therefore declare an interest. That experience of chairing the first URC to be designated, some five years ago, makes me all the more appreciative of the extraordinary challenges that lie ahead of the ODA. It will require enormous attention to detail and the most sensitive approach to put the blueprint into effect. We are not just dealing with pieces of land; we are dealing with <br>&nbsp;<br>

people&#039;s lives&#151;people who, at present, may feel threatened, and towards whom special care should be shown. I would welcome the Minister&#039;s response to criticism from some quarters that existing businesses and some local residents have not had a proper hearing or compensation. How does the Bill help in these matters?
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>Over the past months I have spoken at conferences looking at the opportunities for the construction industry and property developers, which were already flowing from the Olympic project. I have also spoken to local authorities closely involved with the project, who see the enormous potential for their areas. Several issues have emerged from these conferences, which I hope the Minister will be able to address, and perhaps reassure us. The construction industry has expressed concern at the lack of skilled and semi-skilled workers, who will be needed to build the facilities required. What is being done to increase the pool of such a workforce?
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>There are existing schemes, with examples all over the country, including apprenticeships, technical training in further education and company-based training schemes. The long-term unemployed are being targeted to encourage them to take up such opportunities, and training in young offenders&#039; institutions and prisons is also under way. These are excellent projects, but what are the Government doing to support and encourage more? Are we providing enough advertisement of skilled and semi-skilled opportunities in all EU member states? Are the regional development agencies fully engaged? I know that the East Midlands Development Agency is doing pioneering work. Their support of Catalyst Corby has been outstanding; are we drawing fully on their expertise?
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>What is the timetable for accountability? Will we be given regular briefings and, perhaps, brought into debates when problems&#151;and they will arise&#151;become apparent? Already the chattering classes, in Hampstead at least, are complaining about the lack of car parking facilities in the overall scheme at the Olympic venues. Perhaps the Minister could take this opportunity to show us how public transport will be transformed to more than meet the requirements.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>Important though these individual issues are, the Bill gives us enormous confidence that London will be a stunning success in all respects, and that the Games will indeed be a triumph. I know I share with the whole House our best wishes for those who lead this project, not least the noble Lords, Lord Coe and Lord Moynihan, and the leaders already appointed to take the project forward. Our Secretary of State at the DCMS and the Sports Minister have indeed been outstanding.

<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>It was also a great pleasure to be present for the highly apposite and beautifully delivered maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. I am already looking forward to her next one. I congratulate Her Majesty&#039;s Government and their allies who are represented in the team which will deliver the Games on having secured them. I have known my noble friend Lord Coe since my eldest son was, two decades ago, one of his colleagues in the Haringey AC, and I have the utmost confidence in what he and his colleagues will achieve.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>The Bill is a timeous next stage. I recognise that it is required to provide the legislative cover for the contract which Her Majesty&#039;s Government have signed with the IOC. I shall comment on only two aspects, which I shall take alphabetically&#151;advertising and biodiversity. They were both covered earlier in the debate. On the former, I speak as a member of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships&#039; House. Your Lordships will know that we drew attention to the significant powers on advertising and supplemental regulations in Clauses 19 and 20. We found those in Clause 19 acceptable, given the special considerations, but we prompted the question&#151;successfully, in the case of my noble friend Lord Higgins&#151;in relation to Clause 20 about why, in disapplying the hybrid principle in Clause 20(4), organisations representative of those affected by the regulations had not been included among those required to be consulted on their content. Only those responsible for planning in the relevant places, the Olympic Delivery Authority and the London Organising Committee, were to be consulted on regulations that the Secretary of State will bring forward under Clause 19.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>If the Secretary of State can change the list of words in the Act by affirmative resolution at any time in the next six and a half years, advertisers are left with little certainty or protection. A television commercial can take much more time to produce than is required for an affirmative order to go through both Houses, and no consultation will have been vouchsafed them in advance. The direct implementation of Schedule 4 <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 273</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

restrictions upon Royal Assent, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, has the same effect. It is worth asking the Minister what is different about this Bill, six years before the Games, from the Communications Act and the Gambling Act, which both afforded comparative consultation to the advertising industry.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>Other noble Lords have alluded to the standard presumption of innocence under English law being reversed into presuming advertisers guilty of infringing the London Olympics association right unless and until they can demonstrate they are not associating with the Games. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, the IOC does not require this. Perhaps it paid us the compliment of believing it impossible that this country, of all countries, would reverse the burden of proof.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>The debate about the vocabulary that will not be permitted in advertising by Schedule 4 is more for Committee, but it may be the first time in English law that the word &quot;summer&quot;, if used in particular connotations, may carry the mark of Cain. I agree that we are obsessive about the weather, but this looks at first a season too far. Under the Act, the term &quot;gold-plating&quot; may even become illegal, but that makes it the more important to make the point now.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>We shall no doubt also debate in Committee why existing powers are inadequate to meet the Government&#039;s needs, and some of them have been quoted, but the scent of retrospection currently lies unsweetly in the air.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>That is a good climatic note on which to change gear to biodiversity. I declare an interest as a vice-president of the London Wildlife Trust, which covers the area of the 32 boroughs, the Corporation of London and the Greater London Authority. The bid document and its logic was well received for its references to sustainability. The trust of which I am an honorary officer supported the prominence placed on biodiversity within the regeneration process and Defra&#039;s promotion of &quot;the sustainable elements of the bid&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>The potential opportunities in the Olympic Park development plans are considerable, but emphasis on the natural environment is not reflected in the wording of the Bill, especially in Clause 4. I foresee a lively debate on the absence of this emphasis from that clause in Committee, given that built structures, sustainable drainage, and the regeneration of the lower Lea to link wildlife sites through a network of ecologically functioning waterways offer such potential. We may be encouraged by the newly appointed ODA chief executive&#039;s decision to slow down decision-making for the Olympic Park with the eventual legacy in mind, but he too would no doubt be encouraged by better legislative cover. Additional environmental benefits could include water recycling and reduced carbon footprint, which were both highlighted issues in the London 2012 candidature file, Theme 5 Environment and Meteorology, which was submitted to the IOC.

<a name="60111-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, I can boast no sporting achievement whatever but I have an interest in transport. I want to see the transport arrangements for the Games work and work successfully. One of the bravest decisions that Ministers made some time ago was not to try to include Crossrail as that would have been a disaster. I believe they have achieved some excellent arrangements without Crossrail. Whether the construction of Crossrail takes place can be debated elsewhere, but the arrangements are very good and I congratulate them.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said, not only could the phrase &quot;gold plating&quot; be illegal but there are one or two matters in the Bill that are, shall we say, gold-plated. I would like to cover those briefly, although not in any particular order.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>I was fascinated by the Olympic transport plan. I recall seeing some of the publicity surrounding the bid and I have this vision of the main Olympic sites in Wimbledon, Wembley and Stratford being connected by vehicle-free roads with competitors, spectators and others being whisked along, led by police outriders and lots of blue flashing lights. That is a very sexy and attractive image for those in the car behind the police outriders, but for the rest of London it could cause a few problems, even in August. Clauses 10 to 15 will require scrutiny because what is required is unclear. It is quite clear that the whole of London and the south east will have to keep the streets clean otherwise somebody will get at them and no doubt charge them for doing the cleaning.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>I would be interested to hear from my noble friend what exactly is the Olympic route network, what is the transport plan and what exactly do they intend to do? They can block up roads and regulate traffic&#151;they could probably do that at the moment if they chose the legislation carefully&#151;but we have to consider residents, traders and businesses. I am sure the problem can be resolved but to me it is extremely unclear and could cause major irritation, which would be a great shame over the next six years. The powers that the Government are seeking are slightly draconian, but we shall see about that.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>I turn to the construction of the facilities, particularly at Stratford. I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group. These days, when large projects are constructed, there is usually a stated intention to bring in as many materials as possible by rail or water, if water is available and, of course, for the Olympics we have the Thames and the River Lea. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_275"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 275</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I cannot see anywhere in the documentation any commitment to using rail freight for bringing in cement, aggregates and building materials. After all, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link has been built with an enormous amount of material brought in by rail, as was the Channel Tunnel&#151;with which I was involved&#151;and as is Terminal 5. How many lorries would have been required to bring in all that stuff, even to somewhere like Terminal 5, which is not in the centre of London? It is unimaginable.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>I was talking to someone today who may be bidding for the supply of cement. He said, &quot;We can bring the cement up the river in 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 tonne barges&quot;. Do you really want all that to be transferred to lorries or brought in from outside by lorry? My worry is that, to my knowledge&#151;and I checked last week&#151;the rail freight industry has not been consulted at all. If you want to bring things in by rail&#151;I expect the same applies to the river&#151;you have to have facilities. There are some facilities on the Stratford site. Very helpfully during the bid stage I had a discussion with the LDA, which said, &quot;We&#039;re going to remove all those facilities at the start of the job because we need to construct a car park there&#151;a single storey car park at ground level. The Queen will drive through it and she does not want to get cement dust on the Royal car&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>I said, &quot;It&#039;s possible to build multi-storey car parks these days and, anyway, you said that you were not having car parks on the site so why not leave the facility that could supply concrete by rail to help build the site?&quot;. Someone grudgingly replied that they might do and I said that they might have to build another siding somewhere else to receive other materials. They said, &quot;There isn&#039;t anywhere else&quot;. I said, &quot;Well we could help look&quot;, but they were not interested. I have heard that there is a certain disagreement between TfL and the Olympic Delivery Authority over this very issue. I think that it is absolutely fundamental. There should be some environmental consideration of the problems of construction. Otherwise, the communities around Stratford will get very angry. It is quite possible to solve but somebody needs to start planning now.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>I had a discussion with the LDA about rail freight going through Stratford during the Games because a large amount goes through Stratford. It will all go underneath in the depths. The LDA said, &quot;We will have to stop it for three months&quot;, which effectively means that the ports of Felixstowe and Tilbury and other places may have to stop running rail freight containers for three months because the container might contain a bomb. I said that a passenger train could also carry a bomb and they replied that they had already decided. I said, &quot;Have you talked to the Department for Transport security department&#151;TRANSEC&#151;to the Metropolitan police or MI5?&quot;. They said, &quot;Who is TRANSEC?&quot;, which showed how good the research was. Eventually, I received letters saying that they were not going to stop trains after all. I hope that my noble friend will give me some comfort that that is still the case because it was not done in a very professional way.

</p>

<a name="60111-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>There is a nasty clause&#151;Clause 17&#151;which gives the Government powers to give directions to an independent rail regulator. We have had problems with this on Crossrail&#151;rather worse problems actually which have been addressed and discussed, but it is not necessary for the Games. Everyone will work together to make sure that the passenger trains can get there and to make sure that the contractual rights that other operators have are not affected. If they are affected, they will have to be compensated.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>The Department for Transport is now in charge of letting passenger franchises. I suggest to my noble friend that he tries to set a timetable for the franchises which will be serving that part of east London and lines leading into that area. They should not start letting franchises around the time of the Olympic Games, because one finds that the senior management of the companies bidding put all their efforts into winning the next franchise and the quality of service can deteriorate pretty fast. My noble friend has six years to sort this out. It also applies to the Docklands Light Railway. Let us let them two or three years beforehand or leave it until afterwards so that everyone can concentrate on making these wonderful Games a real success. I wish them well.

<a name="60111-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, when the Secretary of State, Tessa Jowell, introduced this Bill in another place last July, she emphasised the many social benefits of the Olympic Games coming to London in 2012. She spelt out in particular the inspiration that they will provide for millions of children with dreams of sporting success, and the chance to transform one of the most deprived areas of London.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>The Government are to be congratulated on losing no time; the decision of the IOC was on 6 July, and moving the Second Reading to give effect to the Government&#039;s commitments was on 21 July. The Bill sets up the Olympic Delivery Authority, to deliver the public sector obligations of the Government, and provides the legislative framework needed to enable this country to fulfil the requirements which the IOC places on whoever is the winning host city.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>Along with the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, I am among the last speakers in this debate before the winding up. For me, there have been two joys. One is to have heard the excellent maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. The second is to have had the joy of hearing the Front Benches of both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties plus the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and my noble friend Lord Pendry all criticise Schedule 4. Tucked away at the back of the Bill, it introduces some of the most extreme legislative forms of restriction on legitimate economic activity that I have ever had the misfortune to see.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>I come to the technical part. Rights, in the nature of copyright, are to be granted by the London Organising Committee conferring exclusivity on,

<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>whoever makes that representation. Breaches can be challenged in the court by the all-powerful London Organising Committee. I declare an interest, as chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority. As such, I, along with my colleagues, am concerned to adjudicate on complaints about any advertisements in any kind of media that are misleading, offensive or irresponsible. But while I hope that noble Lords will agree such advertisements as those deserve to be condemned in the public interest, I am committed in general&#151;as I hope noble Lords also are&#151;to freedom of speech, including freedom of commercial expression. I want restrictions of any kind, whether inserted by Her Majesty&#039;s Government or elsewhere, to be adequately justified.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>I hope I am not being too pompous about it, but would we not all agree that advertisements are largely useful to consumer choice? Marketing freedom is certainly of the essence of competitive economic activity. There are restrictions on the marketing of goods or services other than those that I have just mentioned&#151;the ads which are offensive or misleading, and so on&#151;where patent rights or copyright belonging to others are adversely affected. The reason for that is perfectly good. If patentees and copyright owners had no period of time when they could exclusively use their patent rights, there would be no adequate incentive to produce the special thing which justifies intellectual endeavour being protected in that way. A monopoly&#151;although it is a word that I do not normally like&#151;is justified, at any rate for a limited period of time, and the current law allows that for those with patent rights and copyright.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a> Schedule 4 attempts to do something similar. Perhaps the Minister will use the argument that London Olympics association rights are just like copyright, and therefore they are perfectly legitimate. Of course, I accept some part of that argument, which is that the London Organising Committee must seek fairly to find entrepreneurs who are willing to be designated and to provide money to help to run the Olympics, and that those sponsors of the Games need exclusivity, at any rate for an appropriate period of time, to justify the investment and the expense of sponsorship. However, the question that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, was the first to raise this evening, which was followed up by an excellent range of detailed comments from the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, followed by others such as my noble friend Lord Pendry and the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, is whether the proposed period of time, from Royal Assent in a few months&#039; time all the way until 2012, is justified.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>A period of six and a half years seems to many people to be more than enough and to be disproportionate to the legitimate needs of the business sponsors. Yet the Government in another place, when this question was raised, referred to unauthorised marketing in 2006 and 2007, before even the time of the Beijing Games, as &quot;ambush marketing&quot;&#151;a phrase that suggests something most undesirable. Moreover, the normal burden of proof, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_278"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 278</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, succinctly said, is reversed, so that in certain circumstances the use of words such as &quot;Games&quot; or &quot;2012&quot;, together with other words that are listed in the schedule, such as &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;silver&quot; or &quot;London&quot;&#151;or even &quot;summer&quot;, as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, pointed out&#151;is caught. Therefore, someone who markets more or less anything as being available, such as hotel accommodation, in the summer of 2012, will be breaching the exclusivity rights laid down in the legislation.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>Other noble Lords have pointed out that even the words in Schedule 4 now are not the only words that people will have to trouble about, because they can be altered at any time by regulation, over which there may be some element of parliamentary control; but advertisers and marketers will not know in advance what they can safely use. Of course, those given association rights need to know that their rights will be protected, so that funding arrangements for the Games can be put in place. But is it not enough for them to know that their rights will be protected in what I might call the immediate lead-up, and of course during the Games, but not next year, well before even the Beijing Games in 2008? As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, pointed out, there is already protection for the London Organising Committee in existing laws; and I think the noble Lord also said that six out of the 10 top sponsors have already signed. So LOCOG seems to be having no great difficulty in obtaining multinational sponsors. The Sydney Games, to which noble Lords referred, did not need such lengthy restrictions to obtain money.
</p>

<a name="60111-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>There is something extreme and undesirable about what is in Schedule 4&#151;most particularly if it is to come into effect at once.

From a sporting point of view, as my family and friends will testify, I am certainly the least qualified.

several organisations that have an interest in the Olympic Games, such as London Remade, who worked with the London organising committee for the Games to ensure that the 2012 bid was the most sustainable ever submitted, and added to that bid green procurement and zero waste. I am also associated with a community-based organisation called O-Regen, which is based in Walthamstow, and whose employment programmes and community centres are exactly what is needed to benefit local people over the next six years in preparation for the Games. Finally, I was a resident of Hackney, one of the five Olympic boroughs, for almost 20 years. I hope that at long last Hackney will get some of the infrastructure it needs as a result of the Games. Indeed, it is my association with community-based organisations and businesses, and my long association with east London, that led me to express the hope that the Olympics will belong to London, and the east of London.

<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State and her team, along with the noble Lord, Lord Coe, the Prime Minister and the Mayor of London, and indeed the young Londoners they took with them to Singapore, are a huge credit to all of us. They did a magnificent job winning the bid. Although I am not a sporty person myself, I supported the bid from the outset, and am enormously excited by the possibilities the Olympics offer, not just to London, but to the UK. Indeed, my home county, Yorkshire, was one of the first to support and then welcome the 2012 Olympics, with Terry Hodgkinson, the chairman of Yorkshire Forward, saying:

My interests lie in the legacy of the Games and the benefits to social enterprise and local businesses, communities and local people over the next six years, during the Games and thereafter. My questions about the Bill are centred on whether the proposals, structures and powers are robust enough and will enable and ensure the delivery of these benefits. This is the test I will be bringing to this Bill in its passage through your Lordships&#039; House.

In other words, to revert to the comfort zone of very large developers and huge management facility companies cleaning up on the big contracts for the Games would mean that much of the real wealth would be lost to the areas that are intended to benefit from them. Part of the planning has to include a commitment to enable the boroughs and communities; schools and colleges; businesses large <br>&nbsp;<br>

and small, traditional and social; and the full range of charity and voluntary organisations to play their part. We do not want an Olympics &quot;done unto&quot; the Lea Valley and the East End of London. We want an Olympics that draws on, builds on and invests in the Lea Valley and the East End of London.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>That will require imagination and long-term aspirational thinking to deliver regeneration to the Lea Valley, wider London and the UK. This is the challenge facing the Government, the Mayor and the ODA. Contracts are already being granted, so no time is to be lost. To illustrate my point, Greenwich Leisure operates leisure facilities in all five London Olympic boroughs, and other London boroughs. It is a social enterprise, which means that its profits are ploughed back into developing community based sports facilities; it means that its governance is locally-based and controlled and that its whole focus is on providing great sports and leisure facilities for local, often poor and diverse communities in London. Already, Greenwich Leisure has started a &quot;kids swim free&quot; initiative as part of its Olympics endeavour. It will provide a special Olympic card for every London school pupil. There is no doubt that Greenwich Leisure and other community-based enterprises, like O-Regen, are perfect for ensuring that the link between training and employment is kept at local level and in a long-term investment in both the five Olympic boroughs and the wider London community. Greenwich Leisure and other local businesses are worried that if the procurement regime bundles contracts together without regard to local employment and impact, in some cases they will not even get the opportunity to tender properly.

However, my understanding is that the Learning and Skills Council is cutting back on its local delivery organisations in the capital and that the delivery of a skilled workforce might already be a challenge. So I hope that the LDA, the Olympics body and the Mayor are already battering on the door of the DfES about this. Perhaps a bit of joined-up government is needed here.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>In my final remarks I wish briefly to address the issue of London&#039;s children and young people. The bid team took those wonderful youngsters with them to illustrate the youthful, modern, multiracial nature of London&#039;s bid and London 2012. Having put children and young people at the heart of the bid, surely we need to put children and young people at the heart of delivery of the games. I have to ask, looking through <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_281"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 281</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

all the documentation so far, where are the children and young people? I hope that as well as the sustainable and environmental measures that are planned, and those against which the games will be measures, we will also be looking for an input and a voice for London&#039;s children and young people, because this is an opportunity to bring games and sports back into the lives of London&#039;s schools and to establish for all London&#039;s children the benefits that that would represent for the long-term health of a generation. We not only need to address the needs of the youngsters who we hope will reach the excellence and expertise that allow them to participate in the games in 2012, but we need to address the needs and expectations of all London&#039;s children and young people.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>I wish the Bill well through your Lordships&#039; House and look forward to my noble friend the Minister&#039;s response to this excellent debate.

<a name="60111-29_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hamwee: </b>   My Lords, I was able to make a note saying that I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, will make an enormous contribution to the work of this House based not just on her speech today but on the evidence of our encounters over a long period. She appeared not even to need the security blanket of a set of notes. I find that not only admirable but truly astonishing. She may have noticed that the rest of us are clutching pieces of paper.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>Where each of us was at 12.47 on 6 June 2006 may be a question that we ask, and exchange anecdotes on, for some time. I declare an interest in that I am the chair of the London Assembly, which incidentally means that I wear the badge that Tony Banks once wore. Because of that, I was in the press gallery at City Hall. A radio station wanted me there for a live reaction to the announcement, whatever it was to be. When it happened, the producer back in the studio was so excited that he forgot about it. I say to my noble friend Lord Addington and to the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, that I was undignified. I did not leap&#151;I do not do leaping&#151;but I did shout, somewhat to my own surprise. Like many others, I did not know until that moment quite how much I cared, nor, indeed, how patriotic I felt about the Games. Being in a position to see the Red Arrows flying over London just after the announcement rather consolidated that feeling.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>Over the next six or seven years, those who ask the most penetrating questions about the Games will be not the Games&#039; opponents, detractors or Cassandras but those who care most about making them a huge success. I include in that our own two Olympians and other athletes, who must know a thing or two about careful and determined preparation. I refer to the success of the Games in all their aspects&#151;the Olympics, the Paralympics, the cultural Olympics and their legacy.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>Discussion about the Paralympics is often, if not an afterthought, at least a second thought, so I thought that I might start with them because London led the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_282"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 282</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

way in 1948, I understand. I only recently discovered that they are in fact the parallel Olympics and they came about because doctors in London were advocating the benefits of exercise for those who were coping with war injuries. London has a great opportunity to distinguish itself again in ensuring that the facilities, the venues and the transport are fully accessible&#151;I stress the word &quot;fully&quot;. That, as my noble friend Lord Addington said, will have the incidental benefit of making things very much easier not for those who come within what most of us might think of as &quot;disabled&quot; but for those who hesitate because they have minor mobility problems, those who have young children and many more.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>London, I believe, must facilitate the Olympic Games as a spectator sport for people who have disabilities and the Paralympics as a spectator sport for able-bodied people, as well as vice versa. With regard to success in making people aware of the Paralympics, a great deal is owed to our own Paralympic athletes, who are very much a part of the bid. It also occurred to me to pay credit to the BBC, one of whose idents&#151;I thought of them as interludes&#151;feature wheelchair users in the red-themed advertisements. I am sure that we will look at this in detail in Committee, but I wondered why the section of the GLA Act which imposes a requirement to have regard to promotion of equality of opportunity and has anti-discrimination provisions is not imposed not just on the ODA but on TfL and the LDA. There may be historical reasons for that.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>Modern legislation also includes sustainability duties and, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said, we may well wish to explore in detail in Committee what is in the Bill now in that regard. The Mayor has said that these will be the greenest Games ever, and the way in which the Games are delivered, both with regard to disability issues and sustainability, will profoundly affect what is delivered. So, rightly, we are all interested in the how as well as the what.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>Volunteers will be queuing up to be involved. That was one of the successes of the Manchester Commonwealth Games. The culture of volunteering is one of huge potential legacies. I understand that more than 70,000 expressions of interest have already been made. These people are a resource for organisations in the run-up. The day when we were originally to have debated the Second Reading of the Bill, I read about an organisation called the Africa Foundation Stone, which received &#163;1,000&#151;a tiny amount in this context&#151;from Volunteer 2012 to hold an Olympic-themed event, a football tournament for young people. The group was formed five years ago by refugees from the Congo who aim to break down the barriers facing Africans living in east London. Sport is a tool, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, was saying. That is just the sort of example to inspire us and show the benefits that can be reaped.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>There are also hundreds of community groups in the area with the potential to play a part in the cultural Olympics. We have not had any mention of those tonight. There is no mention of them in the Bill; I hope there is no significance in that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60111-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>To succeed&#151;I echo the noble Baronesses, Lady Thornton and Lady Valentine&#151;the community as a whole and local communities need to be taken along with the preparation for the Games and the establishment of a legacy. We cannot have people saying, as some said of Manchester, that they did not get the maximum benefit because they did not feel that the organisers of the Games tried to incorporate opportunities for local businesses into their planning. That was the Federation of Small Businesses, and I should say that it was not a universally shared view, but it is, perhaps, a warning.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a> There is a responsibility&#151;I put it that highly&#151;to create jobs for, and to skill, local people. None of that can be understated. I take the view that the ODA needs to set targets for the employment of local people, the granting of contracts to small and medium-sized enterprises, to BME and indeed to women-led businesses right from the start. I do not underestimate the difficulties, but assisting such businesses to bid&#151;providing information, helping them through the tendering process&#151;is hugely important. I commend what the LDA is doing thus far, but it is going to have to do a great deal and be very imaginative if it is to fulfil a role as champion for the area.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>There has inevitably been much scepticism over the cost of the Games, and that has been shared tonight. People keep asking whether the Games will be delivered on time and to budget. Asking whether they will be delivered on time is a nonsense, because if they are not on time, they will not be delivered. Perhaps, however, I am not the only person who has heard the story of the noble Lord, Lord Coe, about the Greek workman who said that there was no need to worry about the completion of the stadium in Athens if the opening ceremony was not going to be until the evening.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>Openness on the budget, as well as keeping it under control, is essential. I may be hampered by being a lawyer, but I am not as reassured as others have been&#151;or as the Mayor tells me I should be&#151;that the memorandum of understanding between the Mayor and the Government protects London council tax payers. The paragraph in what is quite a short agreement&#151;even as a lawyer, I congratulate them on that&#151;says that it means the &quot;expectation&quot; of Ministers and the Mayor is that the amounts set out in the memorandum be met by the National Lottery and council tax precept, and that the LDA will continue to be available should it be required; and that Ministers and the Mayor agree to &quot;review&quot; the arrangements. That, to me, is an agreement to agree, not any sort of guarantee.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>There is much reliance, as noble Lords have said, on the lottery. There must be uncertainties in a changing economic situation about how much the lottery can be expected to raise. I understand that the scratch card&#151;which was printed initially in Atlanta, but now moved to Leeds&#151;did not enjoy as much success as had been hoped for, so there is ground already to be made up.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>The amount paid by London council tax payers will be very topical during the next couple of months as the first precept is received. Wearing my London <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_284"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 284</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Assembly hat, I am keen that we ensure that what Londoners and others on their behalf pay is what they thought they had signed up to when they sent all those texts and e-mails in support; that is, &#163;20 a year at band D for 10 or perhaps 12 years. If other costs are associated with the Games&#151;I say that there are because &#163;500,000 has already been allocated in the core GLA budget for associated costs next year&#151;they should be made absolutely clear, because we all ought to know what is needed.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>The London Assembly has already asked the Mayor and the LDA a lot of questions&#151;constructively, I hope&#151;and I assure the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that if any proposal is made to take over the Centre Court at Wimbledon, we will be on to it. I suspect that it will not get permission for capital funding. We have had also a useful correspondence with the Minister for Sport about the role of the Assembly, and I will seek in Committee to be very precise about this. For now, I shall say simply that I am very keen that the Assembly has the powers as well as the will to play a full part in scrutinising the London bodies involved and their London activities, including the ODA.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>Although I do not doubt the Government&#039;s good intentions, I observe that their control of the ODA is enormous. The Secretary of State appoints not just the chair and all the members, but the chief executive, the finance director and the director of transport. Are the Government paranoid, or is it me? Despite all those powers of appointment and dismissal, Clause 23(6) states that the ODA must go on with versions of its strategy,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;until it obtains the Secretary of State&#039;s approval&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-29_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>or, in the vernacular, it gets it right. And the Secretary of State still has powers of direction.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>There must be openness in the way the ODA operates. We have had the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Although it does not make any negative comments on the Bill, we have seen the memo from the Department for Constitutional Affairs. That draws attention to the large number of delegated powers, which mean that there will be a large number of instances where Parliament can be involved and say yes or no, but cannot amend what the Government propose.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>I continue the theme of clarity, but turn to transport. The London boroughs are concerned to know the likely extent of the Olympic route network&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, touched on that; the extent to which measures such as Olympic lanes will be imposed; the extent to which they are necessary; and when the ODA&#039;s traffic powers will start. I do not need to repeat what my noble friend had to ask about transport, but the points that he made about the lead-in time are those which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, made and we need to explore them.
</p>

<a name="60111-29_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>It is inevitable that one will sound negative when speaking on a Bill at this stage, but we have a job to do. The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games should stretch our horizons. They are about a &quot;can do&quot; attitude. We will do it; we will do it very well. The <br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments from these Benches and, I am sure, from around the House will be designed to contribute to that.

<a name="60111-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Luke: </b>   My Lords, it is a very special moment for me to be taking part in this debate about the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. My father was a member of the International Olympic Committee for a considerable number of years and he always hoped against hope that the Games would one day return to Britain. He would have been delighted at the present outcome. He was also the predecessor of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, as president of the Advertising Standards Authority, and I am sure noble Lords will agree with me that he would have thoroughly approved of the noble Lord&#039;s excellent speech.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>We have listened to many fascinating speeches on the Bill this evening. Many important points have been made, but the most important point is that all of us, on all sides of House, are in favour of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>We have heard about a number of things since it was published, but we have not heard much about security. No doubt that is because security would be prejudiced if the arrangements were common knowledge. We must trust that this matter is under control, and I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that later.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>As my noble friend said, we on this side of the House have the same objective as Her Majesty&#039;s Government. During the course of the Bill, our debates will have the sole purpose of improving it.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>It has been a particular pleasure to listen to the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine. When I made my maiden speech, I was simply terrified, and I do not know how I remained standing while doing so. The noble Baroness showed complete sangfroid, and I look forward to hearing her speak during the course of the Bill and on other occasions.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>These are the London Olympics, but we must not forget the events that will be taking place outside London. It is therefore disappointing that the Bill establishes the regional development agencies as the bodies concerned with preparing for the Games outside London. The RDAs are neither local planning authorities, nor highway authorities. These events will have local implications, not regional ones. We shall pursue this matter during the course of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>It is axiomatic that the control of costs throughout the build-up period and during the Games should be robust but, at the same time, it must be sufficiently lightly applied to ensure easy co-operation between the various interests involved.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>As your Lordships know, the Bill will be going to Grand Committee. That is a good decision, although there is no provision for votes. However, in a Bill like this, is unlikely that there will be fundamental differences, and the informal atmosphere of a Grand Committee should lead to better discussions, particularly about details of the Bill. I ask the Minister to agree that we should have the fullest possible <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_286"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 286</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

debates and to adopt a position permitting some flexibility on detail in the light of our discussions in Committee and subsequently.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>Many issues have been raised, not least the rather vexed question of the duplication of powers. It would be disastrous if works were delayed because of interminable arguments about responsibilities. For instance, which is pre-eminent, the Olympic Delivery Authority or the Greater London Authority? What is the precise role of the Mayor of London? As my noble friend Lord Higgins said, it must be defined so that he becomes a facilitator, and not in any way an obstacle to the smooth progress that is essential if all works are to be finished on time.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>Is the remuneration of the businesses that are being moved out, which were mentioned by my noble friend Lord Glentoran, being funded by the Government, as it should be, or is it being left to the Greater London Authority, which, I fear, may lead to considerable delay? The one thing we cannot have is delay.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>The tax on lottery proceeds has been a great bone of contention. It is completely illogical that it should be retained by the Treasury, which is refusing to fund coaching for our precious elite athletes adequately. They might just win medals, but only if they have the best available coaches. That is most urgent. It is not something that can happen in some years&#039; time. It must happen now.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>Can the Minister guarantee that designs for buildings, structures and the general site will be British? Will the provision of horticulture and other facilities decorating the whole site be from Britain, and not sourced from Holland or anywhere else abroad?
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>We have heard a lot about the legacy at the end of the day. Are the Government aware that the accommodation provided for the athletes in Sydney was all sold off before the Games opened as low-cost affordable housing? Are we planning, as I hope, to do something of the same sort, or will it be left to rot, as I am told happened in Barcelona?
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>To conclude, I wish the Bill a fair passage through this House, coupled with the hope that the Minister will listen to what has been said today, and that he will help us to help him pass this Bill with as little extra delay as possible. I look forward to his reply.

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="60111-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, this has been a most stimulating debate. The undercurrent in all the speeches is support for the Bill. I would have been shocked had anyone expressed any other view except support for the broad principles. At the same time a wide range of reservations about aspects of the Bill, and uncertainties about it, have been expressed. That is what the Committee stage is for. I recognise that we will have a lively Committee stage and that we have a number of issues to discuss within that framework. I do however hope that we will not allow too many of the related but extraneous matters to intrude. I understand the view expressed by the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Luke, and others, that we need to look at the question of funding, for instance <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_287"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 287</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with regard to elite athletes. How could we consider success with regard to the Games if British participation was not a success in itself? We need to address that. Yet within the framework of this Bill, it would be odd if we thought that we had a clause which actually identified how that funding was to be mobilised. That is a matter for other funding authorities and arrangements. I hope we will not be side-tracked too widely down extraneous matters of that kind, important though they are.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>The majority of speeches concentrated on what is in the Bill and the issues which remain to be defined with greater clarity. As all other Members have done, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, on her maiden speech. It was a tour de force on her part. It is normal when one hears a speech of such excellence to express the hope that we will hear from the noble Baroness again soon. The great danger in expressing that view from this Dispatch Box is that it means a contribution in the Committee, which puts the Minister back on the hook. She will forgive me if I say that I hope to hear her again soon but that that is not an automatic invitation to participate in Committee&#151;although she would be welcome. She demonstrated today that her expertise well fits her to play a constructive role in that respect, if she decides to do so.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>On the more general issues, we all recognise the enormous opportunities that the Olympic Games provide for this country and the significance of the success of the bid on 6 July. I reiterate my opening remarks: the International Olympic Committee is pleased with our progress and the introduction of this Bill so early after the successful bid, because it lays the framework on which we prepare for the Games. That leaves us open to one or two challenges which I intend to respond to in a moment, not least the one that we now have a context of restrictions as regards advertising. This was voiced by the noble Lords, Lords Glentoran and Lord Clement-Jones. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, drew my attention to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#151;of which he is a distinguished member&#151;which also drew attention to this issue, as did the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.


</p>

<a name="60111-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>Confronted by those challenges, I was already withering in my seat before the blast from immediately behind me from my noble friend&#151;I put the emphasis on &quot;friend&quot;&#151;Lord Borrie, who told me exactly what a monstrosity I had erected in the Bill for the advertising industry. Let me assure him and the whole House that we want to act early because we have obligations to the International Olympic Committee on necessary restrictions on what is the useful phrase of &quot;ambush marketing&quot; and the use of Olympic symbols. We want to act early, but we want to act judiciously. Of course we have no intention of being censorious and prescriptive to that degree. My noble friend Lord Borrie gave vent to some fears that even the word &quot;summer&quot; might be subject to a ban if used within certain forms of advertising.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>Of course we intend to act carefully. A light touch will be applied in the early years, but we need to safeguard the interests of sponsors of the Games and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_288"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 288</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consequent funding. We have obligations to prohibit and restrict ambush marketing, but we recognise the point made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and reinforced by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and other noble Lords who contributed to the debate, that we need to consult. I recognise that that obligation is enjoined on us and we intend to ensure that we have the framework for it. I cannot go into a great deal of detail at this late hour without producing a speech of inordinate length, but I recognise the force and legitimacy of the challenges that have been articulated this evening and I give earnest of intent that we have both thought through the issues and intend to reply to them during the Bill&#039;s passage. That will guarantee that advertising is a fruitful and important area of discussion in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>Likewise, on costs and financing of the Games, I hear what noble Lords say about council tax and, in particular, the siren voice, which came first from the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, but he was not the only one, that the Bill should contain a cap on council tax obligations. The problem is obvious. Once we place a cap on any one area of expenditure, we leave the others open to greater exploitation. We then do not create a due regard for costs. If one contributor can reach a limit and cease to make contributions, we lose the essential partnership of scrutiny and control of costs for those contributions in which we want all contributors to be part.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>I will of course listen to representations in Committee, which I imagine will be presented with some force, but we take the issue as a matter of principle, so I shall be very resistant on that point. I am not negligent about the force of the arguments that can be presented&#151;not least, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, reminded me, that we are approaching elections when precepts, costs and local taxation generally become the stuff of public debate. Questions will be asked. I do not live in a false world in which I think that I am likely to escape close challenge in Committee on these matters. I merely indicate that the Government have thought through the issue of costs and we will need a great deal of persuading to change our mind on how we approach the issue.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>I cannot give a date for the report on the analysis of KPMG and the work it is going to do. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, would not expect me to be definitive about when the report will be given. We are commissioning the report against a background where we know at an early stage that we want the most accurate and broadest picture we can get of the business plan, if you like, with regard to the Games for the future, if that is not too grandiose a term. This work is part of the arming of Ministers, the wider public&#151;because we will in due course make such work public&#151;and all those with authority for dealing with the Games and the plans for the Games to enable us to work towards intelligent budgeting. I have no doubt at all that the interest with regard to costs will run throughout the whole of the period, up to and including the period when the Games are being delivered.

<a name="60111-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, questioned me on a number of other aspects which I know he is going to pursue in Committee&#151;for instance, the powers of the Mayor and the relationship between the various bodies. I understand that there are areas that we need to probe and discuss which will be properly located in Committee, but I am grateful to the noble Lord for using his Second Reading speech to indicate the areas of real concern.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, concentrated overwhelmingly on the main issues of costs and advertising. I make the obvious point with regard to the advertising run: that comparisons with Sydney are merely comparisons with the fact that Sydney got under way rather more slowly than we are doing. To say, therefore, that we should put a self-denying ordinance on ourselves to not look at these issues until four years immediately before the Games and let everything run in an untrammelled way up until then would not be politic or appropriate conduct on the part of the Government.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>I recognise that we have to make sure that we are fair to the bodies concerned and we are under an injunction from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee to consult. I give an undertaking from the Dispatch Box that, whereas we will be increasingly rigorous as we approach the Games with regard to advertising constraints, there will be a relatively loose rein in the next two and a half years. We recognise that we are some distance from the objective and, in any case, nothing could be more unfair than for people to fall foul of constraints of which they were not aware when they were doing their long-run planning for advertising, a matter to which several noble Lords referred during the debate.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>From his considerable experience of these matters, my noble friend Lord Pendry raised an issue that I should have anticipated. We are obliged to address ourselves to the question of the touting of tickets. I agree entirely that this is an iniquitous form of exploitation of the genuine sporting fan and of a whole range of leisure opportunities. We are obliged under the agreement to deal with this matter in regard to the Olympic Games, but when are we going to deal with the broader issue? My noble friend will forgive me on this occasion if I express my total understanding of his position, which he has articulated in the past, and my great sympathy with his objectives, but he will recognise that it would not be appropriate within this Bill to address the general issue of touting, difficult as that issue may be. What I am sure the noble Lord will appreciate is that dealing with this issue within this more limited framework gives us inside guide and experience as to how we might address ourselves to the more general issue, which I know he feels very keenly about. I think the noble Lord has support from other parts of the House for that.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, addressed himself, as I expected, to the crucial issues of costs and advertising. I would hope that I have already covered these by this stage, but he did raise, for the first time among contributors to the debate, the issue of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_290"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column 290</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

transport. He chilled my blood once again by indicating just how vulnerable transport systems can be in the congested capital in which we live. I take that on board entirely. It is the case that we are giving powers and expect carefully thought-out plans for how transport arrangements will work. My noble friend Lord Berkeley reinforced this point from his particular perspective. Let me say this: we would not have won this bid if we had not been able to convince the Olympic Committee that the bid was the best, technically, that they had seen. That revolved around the difficult issue of transport. I say &quot;difficult issue of transport&quot; because London is a difficult city in which to transport very large numbers of people. It is a very congested city with a very large number of inhabitants.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>Of course, we have plans in place for these transport issues; I have no doubt that we will discuss them further in Committee. If the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is in Committee, there is no doubt about that. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has a faithful acolyte when it comes to representation on transport. Suffice to say that we regard the issue of successful transport, and how we conduct ourselves over those crucial weeks when not only the athletes, but even more crucially, the very large number of visitors we expect to be at the Games, need to be transported effectively to the venues, as an absolutely crucial dimension.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, was kind enough to indicate that he and I had joint experience of disabled matters and legislation before this House. If I was in a position to reassure him on every conceivable point about the disabled and transport, and that he would not need to table any amendments at all, I would have produced a Bill unparalleled in the history of this House. The noble Lord will always have issues he wants to explore regarding the needs of the disabled. Let me give the noble Lord this reassurance: by 2012 certain aspects of transport will have passed through the framework of our recent improvements to the original Disability Discrimination Act. Certain of those consequent reforms will have worked through the system by then. I can, for instance, give him considerable assurances with regard to rail. We will have proper accommodation for the disabled, including the issue he raised about signs on trains. We will, to a certain extent, have those by 2012, though not necessarily on every train in the United Kingdom. He will know how far we have made progress in that respect. I expect him in Committee to take every opportunity to push me further on these points. Certainly, it is inconceivable that we would dare to mount the Olympic and&#151;let me emphasise&#151;the Paralympic Games, and yet fail in our duty to disabled attendees and participants.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>My noble friend Lady Billingham brought to my attention the advantages we could get from looking at the strategies pursued by places like Corby in terms of the development of sites and the necessary planning and co-ordinating activities. This Olympic venture requires us to obtain co-operation on a very high level. We will need all the experience we can get, although <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60111-30_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>As well as emphasising the issue of advertising, the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, dwelt on the sustainable aspect of the Games, particularly on the sustainable environment in relation to the Lea Valley. That is a very important point. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, reminded us, the Mayor cannot call these the green Games if what we leave behind is very different from greenness and there is no environmental sustainability. That is an important dimension; we will need to reassure ourselves that it is in place, and we will have the opportunity to explore it in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>I have said that my noble friend Lord Borrie concentrated on the area he knows best&#151;so well, indeed, that I would not dare cross swords with him on the matter. I merely take on board the challenges that he has presented and shall seek to reassure him in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>My noble friend Lady Thornton also emphasised the regeneration of the Lea Valley. It is long overdue, as she knows only too well. It is depressing that we do not have too many great river systems in London apart from the Thames. However, the Lea Valley is a considerable river system; in the upper reaches very considerable work has been done by the Lea Valley Regional Park Authority to improve it, much less in the area where the Olympic Games site is to be located. We must seize this opportunity to make sure that this inner-city part of the Lea is also part of that regenerative process and gives new enjoyment to the people who live there.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that we would be exploring the role of the Assembly in this respect. I have no doubt that a great deal of our Committee work will be about the inter-relationship between various institutions and their responsibilities. I look upon that debate with the greatest enthusiasm, if only because I will not give way to the noble Baroness if she tests my enthusiasm at this point. We will need to explore these points. The inter-relationship between the authorities is a very important part of the success of the venture.

<a name="60111-30_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luke, mentioned security, which had been raised by the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Higgins. The Bill does not spell out the security arrangements in great detail, but if we needed any reminder of how important security would be to the significance and success of the Games, we had it the very next day after the bid had proved successful. None of us can dwell upon the success of 6 July without recalling the horror of 7 July, so of course security will be a very important dimension of the Games. We are seeking in the Bill to identify how relationships with the police will work. There are limits to the extent to which we can be explicit, but I give the assurance that this is a very important consideration.
</p>

<a name="60111-30_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luke, also asked me to make sure that every plant in every building came from the United Kingdom. I might be stretched to do that. Given the extraordinary achievements of British architecture in recent years, I would be shocked if significant pieces of architecture required for the Olympic Games were not produced by British architects. Of course, the noble Lord would chastise me if I suggested that there should not be an open contest with the most successful and attractive bid succeeding; I am not about to produce a closed environment for British architects. The Olympic Games provide an opportunity for all aspects of British life to benefit. Architects ought to be able to show just what a high level of architecture we have in the United Kingdom. I hope that that will be demonstrated in the Olympic venues.

<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>We have had a most interesting debate. It started a little later than many noble Lords would have wished and it has finished a little later than your Lordships would wish. Therefore, I apologise for my extra contribution.

<a name="60111-31_para1"></a>
<p>[<i>Amendment No. 16 not moved.</i>]
</p>


<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60111-31_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dholakia </b>   moved Amendment No. 17:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 3, line 20, at beginning insert &quot;for the purposes of subsection (1)(b),&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are in the names of my noble friend Lord Avebury and me, and Amendment No. 22 is grouped here in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I will speak to Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 and let her talk about Amendment No. 22; if need be, my noble friend Lord Avebury or I will comment on that amendment after she has spoken.
</p>

<a name="60111-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Amendment No. 17 limits the reference to the person in the UK needing to be settled here to cases where the person seeking entry clearance to join them is applying for settlement, not just to visit. Clause 4 removes all right of appeal against the refusal of entry clearance, and provides limited powers to restore such rights by order to visitors and dependants. New Section 88A(2), inserted by Clause 4, sets out a non-exhaustive list of ways in which the restoration of rights may be further restricted. One of its provisions, new paragraph (c)(i), is by reference to whether the person whom the applicant seeks to visit or on whom he depends is lawfully settled in the United Kingdom; that is to say, he is a person with indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. The effect of the amendment is that the regulations can, in deciding on the circumstances in which a dependant should have right of appeal, make reference to whether the person on whom they depend is settled or not. If the amendment is accepted, it will be clear in the Bill that the regulations may not make provision for settlement to be a relevant factor in the case of visits, so we are distinguishing between the two categories.
</p>

<a name="60111-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>People working or studying here may be here for many years and would expect during that time to receive visits from family members. For example, if their spouse, partner or child is refused a visit, it would be a serious matter and should attract a right of appeal. It is also pragmatic. It would save the family member within the UK having to challenge a refusal for a judicial review, alleging breach of human rights, or through channels such as a complaint to a Member of Parliament to be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.

</p>

<a name="60111-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 18 is to avoid making a subjective test&#151;that of intent&#151;the determinant of whether or not a person has an appeal against refusal of entry clearance. New Section 88A(2)(d) refers to the applicant&#039;s purpose in entering as a dependant. It recalls that famous &quot;primary purpose&quot; rule, if the Minister is aware of that, and the agony and distress that it has caused over years to many families can be compared to what is on paper here. It could be used to make a subjective test&#151;that of purpose&#151;the determinant of whether the person has a right of appeal or not. The Minister of State in the Commons stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;We are looking for the most productive . . . transparent and clear set of rules and regulations so that everyone, including the applicants, understands exactly what is going on and, if a decision goes the wrong way, understands the precise reasons why . . . It is in that context that we need to understand what is going on in clause 4&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 20/10/05; cols. 113-14.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>To justify removing rights of appeal, the Government have attempted to rely on the notion that the points system will be objective, transparent and simple. We doubt that justification: objectivity is not so easy to achieve and establishing whether the most objective criteria are met may involve people weighing complex evidence. Moreover, mistakes will always be made, as has often happened with the primary purpose rule, frequently by an administration that is not subject to oversight by the courts.
</p>

<a name="60111-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>In any event, the subsection in question expressly envisages that the points system will involve entry clearance officers abroad making subjective decisions. That calls into question the whole rationale that the Government have presented to us for making these changes. If new Section 88A(2)(d) were intended to cover only objective criteria, that could be achieved by specifying categories of dependants in the legislation. That approach would be preferable and would meet the criticism of the House of Lords Constitution Committee on setting out appeal rights in secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60111-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Entry clearance officers are poorly placed to assess purpose, as the Government have recognised, in that they have indicated in their consultation on the points system that they would like to get rid of the subjective test of whether the person is going to leave the United Kingdom. Why then introduce a new subjective test here? The outgoing Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance noted in her evidence to the Home Affairs Committee on 13 December 2005:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;Most cases focus on the intention to return and it is there that things get very complicated because basically an entry clearance officer has ten minutes to decide whether somebody is going to go back&#151;they have a ten-minute interview or roughly about the same amount of time if they are looking at some pieces of paper&#151;and I do not think they are given any sensible criteria on which to do that. I am not sure how easy it would be to formulate sensible criteria anyway, but the ones presently used are not, and I think the courts have said that as well, but entry clearance officers just carry on&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The independent monitor goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;I really do not know, and I would like to see UKvisas write it down how entry clearance officers assess intention to leave the UK at the end of the visit on paper. I have asked them to do that as <br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>one of my recommendations to give guidance to ECOs as to how they are to do that. They have said they will but it has not happened, and I think it is because it is very difficult to articulate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Those are striking comments from the independent monitor and ought to be taken very seriously. Unless we get a specific assurance from the Minister on the matter, we would have great difficulty in supporting this measure. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60111-31_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, said, my name is on Amendment No. 22. I am grateful for his support for that amendment, the purpose of which is to probe the scope of the meaning of &quot;dependant&quot;&#151;the person for whom appeal rights can be restored by regulations under new Section 88A(1)(b). It is unclear whether a spouse, fianc&#233;, unmarried partner or civil partner would be regarded as a dependant. The heading in the current Immigration Rules is &quot;Family Members&quot;, of which dependent relatives are a subset. I hope that that will be the case under the Bill, but I would welcome clarification of that. Amendment No. 22 includes a reference at the end to &quot;such other persons&quot;; it would give the Secretary of State the power to prescribe those other persons by regulations simply because new categories sometimes appear, most famously in the case of civil partners.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60111-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My noble friend kindly invited me to make any comments that occurred to me after the noble Baroness had spoken. There is very little that I need to add, but I mention particularly our support for the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, in her amendment, which at least tries to specify who we are actually talking about.
</p>

<a name="60111-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>I think I am right in saying that my noble friend did not mention the likelihood of many human rights appeals from close relatives affected by this clause. This is one of the many instances that occur in the Bill where human rights appeals will be provoked, and we had some discussion on that the day before yesterday. I do not think that the Minister had a chance to respond to what was said about clogging up the machinery with a vast number of human rights cases. That probably was not the intention of the Government in drafting these provisions, but certainly when a parent, partner or child is denied a visit, that would undoubtedly raise human rights concerns. That would be an obvious route for the person to take if they felt that the decision was contrary to their rights under the convention.
</p>

<a name="60111-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The only other thing that I want to say is on Clause 18. My noble friend has already mentioned the incapacity of entry clearance officers to make decisions in 10 minutes, as they do at the moment. Again, I invite the Minister to say something about that, because she was loquacious about the improvements that had been made in the system when we were talking about Clause 1. However, I did not notice anything about the number of entry clearance officers, the length of their training, or their ability to cope with existing practice, let alone incorporating the objective assessments that they will have to make as a result of these provisions.

</p>

<a name="60111-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Although criticism has been made of entry clearance officers, and my noble friend has drawn attention to the remarks in the report of the independent monitor, we are being unfair to them. You cannot ask people to do that; even the appeals that are decided on paper take 10 minutes. They are going to have to look at the intention of someone coming here as a visitor and try to work that out in 10 minutes, in addition to examining all the documents to find out whether they are forged or in some way defective. If they have also got to address their minds to the question of what a person intends to do in the United Kingdom, I can only think that is asking too much of people who are not very highly paid, who are given a minimum of training, and who are already being asked to do much more than they are capable of.

<a name="60111-32_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for his final comments about entry clearance officers. I was mindful on Monday that, by and large, they do a very good job and they work very hard, and the noble Lord is right to credit them with being able to do work within the limits of their own resources. It is important in developing the strategy to make sure that they have the ability, training and support that they will need for the new role, as much as we want to ensure that for the existing role. It is absolutely right, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has indicated, that we are and will be giving more training opportunities, and we are looking at the number of entry clearance officers developing their skills appropriately. In part that is done through better support through the entry clearance management programme, through the existing structures and by looking at ways in which we can ensure that this happens appropriately. I indicated on Monday that I plan to write at the end of this week, I trust, to the Committee, to set out in more detail all the different ways in which we are seeking to support officers and the system. I did not go into all the details on Monday, partly because I thought it better to set that out in writing definitively. I hope that between now and the next stage of the Bill noble Lords will discuss with me their views on what we are doing and that we can reassure them that we are seeking to deal with the matter effectively.

I refer to the position of the Lord Chancellor as seen from a DCA perspective. I hope that will allay the noble Earl&#039;s concerns on that issue or, if not, that he will return to it.

appeal for someone who comes as a family visitor, regardless of the immigration status of the family member. The Bill would allow us to require the family members to be settled. Of course, that does not prevent people coming in as visitors. We are not saying that people cannot come and visit. We are simply saying that we are looking to those who are settled here for the category of full right of appeal that goes alongside family visitors. However, we are not suggesting that people should not come to this country to visit relatives. That may not satisfy the noble Lord but I want to put on record that we are not suggesting that people should not come and visit; we are simply trying to define that in a very particular way.
</p>

<a name="60111-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I learnt about the primary purpose rule to ensure that I understood precisely what happened in that regard. It is absolutely not our intention to bring it back. We repealed it for good reasons&#151;which I am sure the noble Lord supported&#151;which I entirely support. If I may put it in a slightly more vernacular way, we are not &quot;love&quot; judges in any way, shape or form. We seek to consider the purpose for which a person comes here. I take the obvious example of a fianc&#233; or fianc&#233;e who intends to get married. That person will tell us when they plan to get married. It is a straightforward matter of asking someone why they are coming here and what is the purpose of their visit. However, the measure is not intended to do any of the things that the primary purpose rule did. I say to the noble Lord that I shall look again to make sure that we have this exactly right as I am utterly in agreement with him in not wishing to see that measure reinstated.

That is very difficult to ensure, particularly as regards people&#039;s intent. How will the Government ensure that an entry clearance officer is not subjective? That was precisely the problem that was encountered <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> entry clearance officers and the primary purpose rule. The Government used to say that in most cases involving the primary purpose rule, particularly those concerning marriages, they did not question the intent but the genuineness of the decision.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;An entry clearance will be refused if the entry clearance officer has reason to believe:</p>

<p>




</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>(a) that the marriage was entered in to primarily to obtain admission to the UK&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="60111-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord will be very familiar with that, but other Members of the Committee might not be. That is quite different from saying that someone is coming here to get married&#151;that the purpose of their visit is to stop being a fianc&#233; or a fianc&#233;e and to become a husband or wife. That is the reason you are coming&#151;you are becoming a family member at that point, as it were. It is a question of asking, &quot;What date are you getting married&quot;? That is not a subjective judgment. It is not a case of someone saying, &quot;I think you are marrying him in order to stay in this country&quot;&#151;which <br>&nbsp;<br>

was the objection to the primary purpose rule. Someone is simply saying, &quot;Can you tell us when you are getting married because that is what you are coming here for&quot;? I deliberately chose that example because it demonstrates for me at least very clearly the difference between the primary purpose rule and what we are suggesting. We would not wish to return to that measure, which we repealed, after all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60111-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My noble friend was suggesting, not that the Government were trying to reintroduce the primary purpose by the back door, but that this clause gives the Secretary of State power to introduce whatever tests of the applicant&#039;s intentions may come into his or her head. We are giving the Secretary of State enormous powers. Although they may not be used precisely to incorporate the primary purpose rule in the legislation, they could be used in ways that demand that the entry certificate officer look into what is in a person&#039;s mind and not into the objective facts in the application.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60111-32_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for going into more detail about that. The purpose of the whole system is to become as objective and transparent as possible. Transparency is critical, as I think all noble Lords would agree. It means, for those coming in&#151;if I revert to our discussions about students&#151;the role of the institutions and&#151;especially as we have Universities UK represented here&#151;the role of the universities in making the determining factor about whether a person has the right qualification and so on to be at the university. Employers will also play a big role in that. It enables them to be far more objective about deciding whether a student has the means to support himself, and so on.
</p>

<a name="60111-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>That is the system we are moving towards. We are not inviting people to exercise greater subjectivity in any way. That will be a critical aspect in setting out the regulations appropriately and developing this&#151;and, of course, consulting stakeholders, as we have sought to do throughout in developing the points-based system. So, I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord completely on this. I accept that the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Dholakia, were not suggesting that the Government were seeking to bring back the primary purpose rule, rather I was intimating that perhaps by accident the noble Lord thought we had. We have been very careful, and certainly I have looked at this to make sure that we were not for all the reasons I have indicated and many more. We are very clear that when people come into the country they should be asked what they are coming for. We would look to do that as objectively as possible.
</p>

<a name="60111-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I am sorry if on Monday I did not go into the question of human rights effectively and the noble Lord&#039;s concern about clogging up the courts. We have made it clear throughout our discussions that there is no intention in any circumstances to take away people&#039;s ability to use the Human Rights Act appropriately to make their claim. The Government are clear about that theme, which, I think, has been accepted by the Committee. We have sought to be as clear and transparent as possible about the people <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC75"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC75</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whom we say will have full rights of appeal&#151;family members in these amendments&#151;who are entering the UK, and that other visitors may apply as appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60111-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Of course there is the opportunity for someone to claim under Article 8 that they wish to make a claim on the right to family life and so on. That right was never going to be withdrawn in any case. The noble Lord may think that that would increase the number of challenges. I hope that that would not happen, as we are being genuinely open that we want visitors to come and visit&#151;the question is, &quot;Are they visitors or family visitors?&quot; But it is always possible that people could use the Human Rights Act, and appropriately so. We do not believe that we are taking a risk. The noble Lord may differ in his analysis of that. In any event, we are agreed that people should have that right and the Government must face the consequences if that does not happen as we believe it will.
</p>

<a name="60111-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, sets out in her amendment the categories of dependant. She is absolutely right that for those who are settled, provided they meet any other requirements, these categories would apply. I take fully the noble Baroness&#039;s additional point about covering new categories, not least civil partners but she will know our view that it is much better done through secondary legislation, simply because, as with civil partners, it is much simpler in parliamentary procedural terms to be able to add new categories, which we would want to do. I can categorically assure the noble Baroness that those are included.
</p>

<a name="60111-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>As noble Lords know, we have just closed the consultation on the points-based system per se, but it has not yet been decided which of the five tiers would include the right to bring dependants in. Those decisions will be made in due course. If they are made during the passage of the Bill through your Lordships&#039; House, I will write to all noble Lords who have taken part in our deliberations indicating those decisions.
</p>

<a name="60111-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I hope that I have responded to all the key points and that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60111-33_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   I want to raise a point in relation to what the noble Baroness has just said in response to Amendment No. 22. We have a new situation since the introduction of civil partnerships. How do the Government anticipate defining such relationships in terms of all the different nationalities who may apply? Presumably the legal position on partnerships is changing in a number of countries. Given that, the definition may be quite difficult.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I note that all this is to be done by the negative resolution procedure, but that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee agrees because that was the way it was done in the existing legislation. All that is fine, but in order to ensure real flexibility, I wonder whether the Government should not find a way for Parliament to question whether some people are being left out. It is a pretty big thing if someone is <br>&nbsp;<br>

not allowed an appeal because they fall outside these categories. Have the Government faced that possibility and considered how they will deal with it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60111-33_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising the point. The DCA is responsible for defining how civil partnerships are recognised and the noble Baroness will know that from time to time I have laid before your Lordships&#039; House details on additional countries and their agreed status. As we work with our partners across the world and look at how they operate similar systems, we ensure that those details are laid before Parliament so that they are fully recognised. On that basis, the process is very straightforward.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The noble Baroness has raised an underlying point here: it is always important and sometimes challenging to ensure that we have in place systems of recognition. On civil partnerships, I think that we have it just about right at the moment, although we are mindful that situations may change. However, this issue points up the need for a degree of flexibility so as to be able to define new categories as they are introduced and when it seems appropriate to do so. We have done that with civil partnerships and so far the procedures seem to be working well.

<a name="60111-33_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  I hope that the noble Baroness does not think that I intended any disrespect by not moving Amendment No. 16, which is tabled in my name. I have not done so only for one reason: the Constitution Committee is to meet next week and I did not want to get ahead of the comments which that committee has already made and it has not yet taken in the Minister&#039;s remarks. We will come back to the point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60111-33_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Of course I did not infer any disrespect on the part of the noble Earl. It is only that I had already asked my officials to do some work on the issue. I have brought the work with me, but in order to ensure that noble Lords have a fuller explanation, I shall put it in writing to the noble Earl and copy it as appropriate to Members of this Committee and those of the Constitution Committee. However, I felt that on Monday I did not give the noble Earl an explanation in relation to the Constitutional Reform Act from the DCA perspective. Having read over the noble Earl&#039;s comments, I think that it would helpful both to him and to the members of the Constitution Committee to have it, and that is what I have sought to do. Having asked my officials to do the work, I do not want to leave it to one side.

<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60111-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s comments on Amendment No. 16 because I too had intended to raise some issues on it. I should be grateful for a copy of the letter that she is to send to the noble Earl so that I can see whether any further points need to be raised at a later stage.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>It would also be helpful if the Minister could indicate before Report the distinction to be made in terms of appeals in relation to people lawfully settled <br>&nbsp;<br>

How will their appeal rights be affected, bearing in mind that there will be students who do not have the right to remain indefinitely in this country yet who may have friends and relations coming to visit them. How will they be affected by this situation? The point needs to be clarified, and if it can be done before Report, that would be very helpful.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>Page 3, line 32, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   A person who may not appeal under section 82(1) shall be entitled to request that a refusal of an application for entry clearance is reviewed by the Independent Monitor or his appointee.&quot;&quot;

<p><a name="st_15"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 19, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 23. The overall purpose of those amendments is to examine and strengthen the role of the new full-time independent monitor. Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 are tabled in order to ask the Government to set out clearly how they expect the new system of the full-time post of Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance Refusals without the Right of Appeal to work? What will be the scope of any review? What will be the limitations placed on the remit of the monitor&#039;s work? Last year, we were told that there were about 280,000 refusals of entry clearance without a right of appeal. After this Bill is passed, it is obvious that that number can only increase dramatically.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>When the most recent monitor, Fiona Lindsley, gave evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, she stated that in most cases the visa files do not give enough information to know whether someone should have got a visa. There is really enough information to know only whether the decision was well made. While recognising that the post will now be full time&#151;naturally, I welcome that&#151;we should also note that the volume of work is therefore likely to increase significantly. It is vital that we are given a clear indication of how the new monitor will be able to operate effectively.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>A problem with the system is that it more or less does what it says on the tin. A monitor can do just that&#151;monitor and report. But he or she cannot take up or make decisions on individual cases. An applicant who has been wrongly refused without the right of appeal has no redress even if the monitor identifies clear maladministration. I have tabled these amendments to explore deficiency in the system. Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 would introduce a formal independent review of non-appealable entry clearance decisions on grounds of maladministration. They ask the Government to clarify whether and in what <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC78</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

circumstances the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration can entertain complaints about maladministration in the refusal of entry clearance appeals. Is it correct that if there is no detriment to a UK-based person, no complaint can be entertained and that there is that restriction? Do the Government intend that it should be accepted that in all circumstances a sponsor has suffered detriment and can complain about the handling of an entry clearance decision. The amendment highlights the fact that those applying for entry clearance have no equivalent of the ombudsman to whom to take complaints of maladministration.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Amendment No. 20 simply probes the Government&#039;s previously expressed intention to have a review system operated by immigration judges at entry clearance posts with the intention that such a system would be fully independent. How will this operate? When will it be introduced? Is there a guarantee that the right of appeal would be abolished only once the entry clearance monitor was satisfied that the review system was robust? I am not saying at this stage that such a system of review can obviate the need for an appeal system. We debated that earlier this week. I certainly do not intend to re-run my arguments. It is important that we know how the monitor will work if the Government decide to remain obdurate in the face of representations made by both Houses and outside organisations which have expertise in those matters. Of course, I appreciate that we will return to these matters today and at Report, no doubt, in further negotiations.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>My Amendment No. 23 adds new subsection (6) to Section 6 of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967. My subsection tries to make it clear that the UK-based sponsor of a person who is refused entry clearance should be able to make a complaint and that whether they can do so or not should not depend on their nationality. This amendment is not to suggest that an ombudsman could be any substitute for the appeals system. I am looking very much at second best; that is, what happens if there is to be no appeal. It serves to remind us of the inability of a monitor or others effectively to provide a form of redress and&#151;as no doubt my honourable and right honourable friends in another place would say&#151;the considerable burdens that are likely to be placed on them if people have no regular channels through which to raise their complaints, except through Members of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60111-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>It also provides an opportunity to understand that the loss of those appeal rights will affect UK-based sponsors as well as people overseas. It is a reminder that posts overseas are more difficult to oversee than UK-based officials: geography, distance and the general feeling of being out of sight and out of mind can create their own problems of accountability and oversight, however well meaning those involved are and however careful Ministers may be to try to put in place what is hoped to be a robust system. I beg to move.

<a name="60111-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I must apologise for having made two errors as regards the independent monitor on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC79</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Monday. First, I said that she left her post on 1 November when it was on 1 December. Secondly, I implied wrongly that the independent monitor might have been pushed, as I understand that she was not willing to accept an appointment on the full-time basis that the post has now become. But perhaps I may be forgiven for making those errors because I tried very hard to find out what was happening on the appointment of the new monitor on Monday morning. I tried to telephone the UKvisas head office. I had great difficulty getting through and I listened to a number of recorded messages. When I finally spoke to a human being, I was referred to the Foreign Office, from which I gathered that the process of selection of the new monitor has been completed, but that the appointment has yet to be approved by the Foreign Office Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, and that the matter may be on his desk now. I am told that the appointee is of a very high calibre. If the Minister would care to break the secret and let us know his or her name, I am sure that we would be very interested to know who that person is.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has said, the remit of the independent monitor is being extended to the much larger number of cases that will arise under the Bill where people have no right of appeal. She mentioned the figure of 280,000 refusals which the independent monitor was already dealing with. I imagine that the figure could double or treble as a result of the extension of the categories of people who do not have any right of appeal. What estimate has the Minister made of those numbers? Are the resources provided to the monitor proportional to the task to be undertaken in accordance with those estimates? If she has not made any estimate, it is difficult to say whether the resources being allocated to the monitor are adequate. I hope that that forecasting has been done.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I am very worried about the large number of recommendations made by the independent monitor in the past to which, apparently, she has had no reply. In the last report, which was published in February 2005, there are two annexes in which she lists all the recommendations in her two previous reports. I take it that she has done that because she is still waiting for a reply from Ministers. What happens to recommendations made by the independent monitor? Are Secretaries of State obliged to reply or do those recommendations simply lie on the table indefinitely for someone to pick up, as we do now when we have an opportunity in Grand Committee? There ought to be a procedure by which Ministers publish answers to specific recommendations made by the monitor within a reasonable period, as in Select Committee reports. It will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say on that.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As regards the ombudsman, to whom the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has referred, I note that UKvisas is not on the list of bodies in respect of which he has the power to investigate complaints, but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is. UKvisas, being a component or a subsidiary of the Foreign Office&#151;I do not quite know how one expresses that&#151;ought <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC80</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

therefore to be subject to investigation. I understand from the office of the ombudsman that if a sponsor in the UK made a complaint concerning the refusal of an entry certificate for a close relative wishing to join him in the UK as a result of unfairness, bias or prejudice, the ombudsman would have power to investigate that complaint. However, it could not tell me whether any such complaints have been made. But, as a matter of common sense, it is obvious that the sponsor and not just the applicant would have suffered harm, particularly but not exclusively when the applicant is a close relative wishing to come here as a dependant. It would be interesting to know whether the Minister has any statistics on the number of complaints to the ombudsman which have been made under this heading.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>With this group we are also discussing whether Clause 4 should stand part of the Bill. As we have seen, the clause drastically curtails the rights of appeal of students, workers, the self-employed, business persons and dependent relatives. That, of course, goes much further, as has already been said, than the Labour Party manifesto commitment to remove appeal rights from non-family immigration applicants. But the manifesto also promised that the Government would improve the quality and speed of decision-making. Again we have noted that there is no sign of this happening in the consideration of entry certificate applications. Although the noble Baroness has given certain assurances, it is all pie in the sky. We have not seen that happening in the overseas posts and no evidence has been submitted by the Minister or in other ways to demonstrate that the improvement in quality has taken place in advance of your Lordships being asked to approve the diminution of rights under this clause.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>In the meanwhile, ECOs continue to deal with the treadmill of 50 applications a day, which, without any regard to what is being done in this Bill, are predicted to double over the next 10 years, putting even greater strains on a system that is manifestly unable to cope effectively with the existing workload. The collection and storage of biometric data on all those applicants, as is already happening in some overseas posts, will add to the burden, necessary though it may be.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>We simply do not accept that a points-based system, which is supposed to reduce the time spent on applications because it is based on objective criteria, will provide the answer, for a number of reasons, which I will summarise. First, there is the element of subjectivity, which we have already discussed on the previous amendment&#151;for example, in assessing the work experience of someone wanting to come here under the highly skilled migrants programme and in the provisions of subsection (2). Secondly, in paper-based applications under the present system, it still takes 10 minutes, as I have said already, to examine the documentation, and there have been problems with forged documents in some overseas posts in particular.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>It is wrong to take away the rights of appeal until the new system has been rolled out and assessed as fair and effective. The Government have said repeatedly that they have already taken steps to improve the quality of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC81</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

decision making, but we have seen no results. There has been no independent monitor in post&#151;not for the three months that I mentioned on Monday&#151;for at least two months. The report that she compiled before her departure still has not seen the light of day. Perhaps the Minister can tell us something about that too. It is a most unfortunate gap to have occurred at a critical period in the development of better procedures, training and supervision. We would like to see Clause 4 scrapped. But if that cannot be done, at least it should not come into force until a day to be appointed by order by affirmative resolution so that the Government could return to your Lordships in a year or two years&#039; time with a better story to tell than they have today.

<a name="60111-34_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 probe the Government&#039;s intention on the future role of the independent monitor. We know that the Government intend to expand the role of the monitor, and that is welcome. Fiona Lindsley, who has only just stepped down, made the point in her last report that she did not have either the time or the resources to do a thorough job. Yet it is clear from our discussions in earlier sittings and this afternoon just how important the role is. If the Government are to get their way and abolish appeals in entry clearance cases as proposed in the Bill, the monitor will become even more important because, as other noble Lords have said, inevitably the volume and scope of the decisions he or she is considering will grow substantially.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The amendments in this group go further than proposing that the monitor should have more time and resources. They suggest that the monitor should have some power to review individual decisions or to make recommendations regarding them to the Secretary of State. I believe that what lies at the heart of these amendments is a response to the palpable frustration that the reports of former independent monitors seem to have had so little appreciable impact on the quality of decision-making. Report after report has identified the same problem. Here I echo the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in saying that I would like my noble friend at the Dispatch Box to tell us what response has been made to the report of the most recent independent monitor, published last February and enumerating fundamental and widespread problems with the decision-making system.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>There is another way in which these amendments might be interpreted. In my view, the right course of action is to retain the right of appeal in entry clearance cases, but these amendments also offer an opportunity to debate whether some mechanism other than that of appeals could secure the same safeguards for individual applicants who have been failed by the system. If the Government are determined to abolish appeals, might there be another mechanism which would still allow for the reconsideration of individual cases by an independent body? I think that the debate is worth pursuing because the likelihood is that if the Government were to be successful in abolishing appeals, leaving no satisfactory means by which to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC82</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

address improper decisions, it is likely that judicial review will be sought. That would be expensive, time-consuming and, I suggest, very likely to bring the Government&#039;s legislation into disrepute. Since that would be the likely outcome if no satisfactory means of challenging a decision is available, would not the Government be well advised to consider whether it would be appropriate to bring forward a mechanism by which some kind of independent adjudication of appropriate cases can be made?
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The Minister has offered to look at whether a formal administrative review could perform this role. Such a formal review could be very helpful and may reduce reliance on the appeal mechanism. But as I have already indicated, entry clearance officers and their managers should not be the final arbiters in decisions that they themselves have taken. Therefore I continue to feel that a final level of independent arbitration should be available where the review does not resolve disputes.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Amendment No. 23 would allow the sponsor of an applicant to make representations in the case of a refusal. I support the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, who said that this would be a &quot;second best&quot; solution compared with retaining appeals, but as indicated in the amendment, it is important that universities are given the opportunity to make representations on behalf of students who are refused visas. That should be a feature of the review scheme we are discussing. But again, along with the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, I feel that this should be additional to, rather than instead of, the retention of an appeals system.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>If none of the schemes proposed in this group of amendments finds favour, can the Minister tell us whether there is not some other mechanism that might be palatable to the Government? For example, I am reminded of the Office of the Independent Adjudicator that was established under the Higher Education Act 2004, legislation that my noble friend at the Dispatch Box and I know well. That office could act as a backstop for cases where the internal complaints procedure within the universities has been exhausted&#151;it has proved invaluable in such cases.
</p>

<a name="60111-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I hope that the Minister can assure us that the monitor will have a real role in safeguarding the quality of entry clearance decisions, but I hope that she will go further and give the Committee some hope that the Government are not opposed to the independent scrutiny of individual decisions taken by entry clearance officers.

<a name="60111-35_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   If I may say so, that was a very important contribution from someone who has been quite close to many of the problems that have been discovered in some sectors of the people who will be appealing. We shall listen with great interest to what the Government say about that. My noble friend has made several suggestions about what might happen to enable a review of initial decisions refusing a request to stay. What difference will there be between the scope there is for the independent monitor under the Bill as compared to the present situation? What we heard on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC83</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the last Committee day was frankly rather horrifying to someone who has not been as close as many people present in Committee have been to the situation&#151;I was appalled, quite frankly. The quotations from the report of the independent monitor did not alleviate my concern. To what extent has the role been expanded? We know that the position will be a full time one; what does that mean? How much greater will the staff be? How much reliance can we place on her ability to do the job that she has been given? From the evidence that we have had so far about the quality of decision-making and the number of appeals overturned under the present system, there is a very big job to do, and it is the nub of the problem of the Bill. We want a comment, which I am sure the Minister will give, on each amendment, so we can hear what the Government think of the various proposals. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, said, if they do not like any of these, we want to hear whether they have any other ideas, because what is in the Bill will not do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60111-35_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am always grateful to noble Lords for going into detail on the issues that they want me to cover. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for the customary generosity with which he described his mistakes&#151;I would not call them that. I completely understand what the noble Lord was getting at on Monday, but he has corrected the factual point. He made the point very well that he was genuinely concerned, and remains so, about the gap. It may be a shorter gap than the noble Lord thought, but in his mind it is none the less a gap. There is concern too that when someone is doing a very good job it is always a point of interest to know why they do not continue with that role. The noble Lord is right, as I, too, checked that it is full time and not part time. I am grateful to the noble Lord for putting that straight, because it is important.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I will not waste the Committee&#039;s time by going over what I said about administrative review. I am mindful that I have started some conversations already with groups outside and with noble Lords on the Committee, and I will continue those this evening to talk further about what I mean by administrative review. To reiterate one point, the context is that in looking across all the information and evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, that came to me on the Bill, it was clear that the big concerns related to mistakes being made. Therefore, it seemed that an efficient process should be put in place that could quickly deal with cases where a mistake had been made on a form, information had been misread or whatever. It would be a better system than an appeal because it would be speedy and efficient. I await more information on cases that would not be resolved in that way because all the cases that I hear about would be. It is important to get that right in a way that addresses those concerns effectively, so I reiterate my desire to involve others, including my honourable friend Tony McNulty, who is responsible for this policy area, not me. That should largely answer the concerns raised.

</p>

<a name="60111-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a> Objectivity, transparency and high quality are very important; noble Lords have reiterated their importance in initial decision-making, and I agree. It is our aspiration and our evidence base for the system that we are bringing into play. The system will enable the applicant to see as much of the information and to be as crystal clear about what is required as the entry clearance officer. My honourable friend said in another place that it was probably impossible to achieve 100 per cent objectivity in any system. That is true in applications to universities or for a job; you get different applicants, you make choices. But I accept that the closer we get to objectivity, the better.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I have not read all the documents of the independent monitor but my guess is that some of the issues that noble Lords are raising are those that the independent monitor raised in previous reports and that we have addressed. As I understand it, historically the position as regards the independent monitor has been that a report is submitted and a formal response given. I have been notified that a response is outstanding from the last report. I would like to have a conversation with my noble friend Lord Triesman, as I have not had time to do it since Monday, although I can write to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and other Members of the Committee with any further comments I might have. That is my understanding of the position regarding the independent monitor to date.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I should like to go through the amendments and deal with the role of the independent monitor in the future, both to remind noble Lords of where the independent monitor comes from and to describe the work that will be done. I accept the underlying principle that, as noble Lords have indicated, it is important that the individual has the resources available to him or her. I do not have a budget figure to give noble Lords, but if I can find one I will give it. Equally, I have no idea who the successful applicant is. It would be wholly inappropriate for me to know and probably deeply inappropriate for me to tell the Committee if I did know. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, it is for my noble friend Lord Triesman to determine. It is important to note that moving to a full-time position was recognition of the future importance of the role.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a> When I read this group of amendments I thought that the underlying question was: when is an appeal not an appeal? The noble Baroness has cleverly sought to demonstrate different ways in which one could have an appeal. It will not surprise her that I will resist the principle of trying to bring in an appeal by a different route. That does not mean that I do not understand and recognise her points, and I am very open to discuss how we have defined the roles, particularly that of the independent monitor. I would be loath to suggest that dealing with individual cases is an appropriate approach in terms of individual complaints.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>In response to Amendment No. 20, the noble Baroness will not be surprised that I am not desperately keen on requiring very hard-worked and extremely good judicial officers to visit different places in order to do I am not sure what. I take the noble Baroness&#039;s point that it is a very good judicial resource <br>&nbsp;<br>

available to us, but I do not think that we could use immigration judges in that way. We want to use them effectively and efficiently in the tribunal system, where they have an important role to play. The noble Baroness will not be surprised that I say that; I can see that she is looking for different opportunities to suggest alternatives.

<a name="time_3"></a>

</p>

<a name="60111-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Let me look now at the role of the independent monitor. I have already said that we have made that role a full-time post in order to make sure that the availability has moved from 40 days to full time. Full time is full time&#151;except for holidays, which people are entitled to take&#151;so the incumbent will be someone who is able to do that.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The incumbent will travel for three months of the year to a cross-section of the posts, which we hope will identify any training gaps, for example, because particular patterns are emerging, or whether there are particular issues that are unique to individual posts. It is important that the monitor is able to take a broad-brush and a specific view; he will have the opportunity to do so in the three months. He will report six-monthly rather than annually. The purpose is to try to get sharper, punchier and more up-to-the moment reports, to which we can respond quickly. I use the word &quot;quickly&quot; mindful that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, will ask me, &quot;Well, quickly means what, in the light of the fact that you haven&#039;t responded to the last point?&quot;. I have already indicated that I will pick up that point.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The role encompasses all the entry clearance posts. A sample will be drawn from those posts to enable us to look across the piece in a random way. The posts will not know which cases are being chosen; they will be picked randomly so there will be no opportunity to simply present cases that these posts wish to have presented. The purpose is to look at the standards being applied to the refusal of decisions. The purpose of the role will be to cover the overall quality of decision-making, particularly regarding consistency, fairness and the procedures that have been used leading to refusal decisions. But, as I have already indicated, it is not intended to look at individual cases that are brought forward. We think that a random sampling across the system will enable us to identify issues that we need to pick up quickly and to deal with them appropriately.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>We are talking about 3,000 to 4,000 randomly chosen entry clearance refusals&#151;those without a right of appeal. As I have indicated, a twice-yearly report will be submitted to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, who will submit it to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60111-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The monitor will also provide recommendations to Ministers and to senior Foreign Office and Home Office officials on issues regarding entry clearance. We hope that the existing good links between the independent monitor and the UK visas operations overseas will be maintained and enhanced by the monitor&#039;s opportunity to spend time visiting the different posts.

</p>

<a name="60111-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>As I understand it, in 2004 the monitor examined 1,791 cases. I have just been given that piece of information. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in particular and other noble Lords will see the scale of the ambition to take up to 4,000 cases across the system. We believe that with this full-time position we have an efficient way of being able to randomly select and monitor across all our posts. The monitor will be able to spend three months a year&#151;a considerable amount of time&#151;with individual posts in order to identify particular things.

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60111-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   It was very kind of the Minister to give the figures. Does the increase in the number of cases that will be examined by the new monitor&#151;up to 4,000, as compared with the 1,791 that were looked at by the independent monitor in her final year of office&#151;represent the same percentage of cases? In other words, is the Minister saying that the number of cases will rise in proportion, as 4,000 is to 1,791, so that the percentage of cases looked at by the independent monitor remains the same as it always has been?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60111-36_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am not saying that the number of cases will rise. If the noble Lord will permit me, I shall write to him about the basis upon which the statistical analysis is done. My own experience of how one determines a random sample is that one looks at what will give one the best possible information to determine what is happening within a system. I presume that has been done in this case. We are anticipating not that the number of cases will rise, but that we will have a full-time person who is able to take a larger sample. I am sure that the sample will be statistically significant as regards detecting trends across the system. By having a maximum of 4,000, as I have indicated, we shall probably be able to pick up individual posts where one might begin to see trends. That will be the basis of the exercise, but I shall confirm that, or deny it if it is not the case, although I am sure that it is.
</p>

<a name="60111-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I am happy to give Members of the Committee more detail on the role of the independent monitor. I indicated&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, suggested&#151;that there had been a successful applicant. I understand that the appointment will be made shortly by my noble friend Lord Triesman. I have asked what will happen in the gap as I do not know when the individual concerned will commence his duties. I have not received an answer in that regard but I shall, of course, let Members of the Committee know when I do.
</p>

<a name="60111-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>As regards Amendment No. 23, there are two points. If one used a different process to develop an appeals system, there could be a wasteful overlap between the work of the commission in this case and that of the tribunal. There is a question mark about whether it is appropriate for the parliamentary commissioner to act in this matter, as in some cases there are rights of redress to the courts. My noble friend Lady Warwick referred to the role of the sponsor. I reiterate that one of the critically important parts of the new system, whether a university or an employer is involved, is that the sponsor will have a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC87</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

much stronger role to play in identifying the individuals whom they wish to study or work with. I do not underestimate that as I believe that it will be a very important factor in ensuring the objectivity that the Committee is looking for, although, as I said, those people will make subjective judgments at one level. It is a case of saying, &quot;We want this individual to come and work for us because we need his or her skill&quot;, or, &quot;We have a vacancy and we believe that the person has the qualifications and/or experience to fill it&quot;. That is an important role. The sponsor also has a role to play in the administrative review. I hope to discuss that in more detail with Members of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60111-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Finally, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#151;I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I am wrong about this&#151;asked how an entry clearance officer would assess the work experience of a highly skilled worker. I envisage that the following will happen with regard to the level 1 tier, although this is by no means set in stone. When I considered the factors that one might take into account, it seemed to me that one could quickly identify the level of a person&#039;s qualifications. The salary they had received may or may not be pertinent as that would depend on which part of the world they had worked in. None the less, one could take that into account. One could take into account the number of years&#039; experience they had and their age in that context. Those are the criteria that we shall consider in a points-based system. It is not a case of assessing whether an individual has the right kind of experience; rather, it is a case of assessing objective criteria such as the qualifications that an individual has. Does the individual have a PhD? Does he have a degree? What kind of work has the individual been doing? We are trying to make the system as objective as possible. We should be moving towards a system that leaves out all subjectivity and is crystal clear not only to the entry clearance officer, but particularly to the applicant. I hope that the Committee will keep that in mind.
</p>

<a name="60111-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I hope that I have answered as many points as possible and that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60111-36_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   I may be being stupid about this, but the Minister said that the independent monitor would report six-monthly, to get the information quickly, and that what would be important was the quality of decision-making. I do not understand how the monitor will know the quality of decision-making in each place. If there is no appeal, what is there to look at? On what will she base the report? I may be muddling the matter. If someone asks to enter and entrance is refused, they cannot appeal. How does she know that that has been properly done?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60111-36_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Baroness is never stupid; in fact, I am always wary when she gets up at the end of a debate, because there is always some question waiting to get me. I think that I know the answer to this one. I was trying to describe someone who picks up a random sample and visits different posts as well. Two things happen. One is that, on a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC88</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

random sample, you can see trends that might occur across all the entry clearance officers&#039; work that may indicate issues that need to be addressed. Decisions may work in a particular way&#151;I am talking not about mistakes, but about the way in which the policy works on the ground&#151;which will enable the monitor to be able to pinpoint issues that may be of great benefit, as things may have got better, as well as issues of concern.
</p>

<a name="60111-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>The second point is that, in visiting and getting information from individual posts, the monitor will be able to look at the sample of particular decisions, why they were made and the pathway that the entry clearance officer took to make that decision. That will identify in individual places any issues of concern about the way in which decisions are made. We do not have to wait for an appeal process; indeed, an appeal process might not give one that result, because not everyone appeals by any means. The monitor will be able to look at how the decision was made, and the criteria and process used, and to make specific recommendations and comments on that. That addresses the noble Baroness&#039;s point; it is exactly how you get to the point of recognising, in an individual place or as a trend internationally, that you have an issue that needs to be sorted out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60111-36_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   I am still wondering about the people for whom there is no appeal, which will happen in future. Is each 10-minute interview recorded somewhere? Is it written down? Are the reasons and criteria written down? How is that done? I am trying to see the justice.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60111-36_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The reasons are recorded; I am not certain whether that is on a form, a tape or whatever. The way in which the decision is made is recorded and available. The monitor is looking at people who do not have an appeal, so the monitor will specifically take the information recorded from a random sample of people who were refused entry and look at how and why that decision was made, as both a trend across the system and in the individual posts that she visits. In that way, she will be able to identify areas of concern, or&#151;I hope equally&#151;areas of extremely good practice that can also be supported.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60111-36_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   The Minister seems to have placed considerable emphasis on the points-based system to remove the subjective decision-making process. I have a lot of sympathy with her, but that approach is not necessarily borne out, on the basis of a number of cases that I have referred to the Home Office. I particularly mean cases from the highly skilled migrant workers programme&#151;ones of which I have personal knowledge of circumstances of individuals abroad and the decision that the Home Office has taken. When those cases have been reviewed, it has been found that the decision in the first instance was wrong. The worst part of all is the fact that, when you want to review the decision, it has cost a hell of a lot of money for an individual to be able to do that at a British post abroad.

<a name="60111-37_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the great care and attention that she has taken in addressing what is for us a serious issue. I am certainly grateful to all those who have spoken. The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, was right in the way she summarised what I was trying to do, which was to reflect the deep concern about how a review system might be robust enough to deal with future problems when we do not have any appeals. Equally, the Minister was right when she described my amendments as something of a mix and match, in that they are trying to look for alternatives as solutions and, through the back door, to keep an appeals system without calling it an appeal. That is why they were probing amendments; I certainly was not putting them forward as the ultimate solution.
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, was right in that we are trying to avoid a situation in which people feel that they have to go through judicial review, because that does not help anyone. It does not help the person involved in the application and it certainly does not help the Government or the taxpayer. The Minister is trying to avoid that, too. I know that there is good will, but we are all still concerned about how the system will operate.
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The Minister was kind enough to offer to write to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, with regard to some of the details about how the statistical analysis would be carried out. I would be grateful if I might be copied in on that. She referred to the number randomly chosen as cases to be tested being between 3,000 and a maximum of 4,000, and the noble Lord asked what that would be as a percentage of the total number of cases, how the percentages work out, and what the future projections about cases that might need to be tested were. I was looking at it in a slightly different way&#151;oh! We are going to have more from the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, in a moment. My question was going to be, &quot;How would the pool be constructed across which the random selection would be made?&quot;. I know that random means random, but you need to know where your pool starts. For example, will the random selection cover all the points round the world where people make applications, or does one take points of application by each country and have a random selection across that? To someone like me, the attraction of the latter course would be that one could track problems in one area; I have mentioned Chennai in the past as being a concern that the Immigration Advisory Service has presented to me. One can also use those random samples to judge against all the other countries as well.

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The noble Baroness made an interesting point about the number of different locations versus the number of countries. I agree that one ambition for random samples should be to identify three matters; I may be completely off-message in terms of policy, but this is important. One is a particular location in a country where things may be being done differently; the second is whether a country is operating differently within the grand scheme of things; and the third is a trend happening across all countries. That is what we need to achieve. As I understand it, there is no settled or final way in which the process will go forward.

<a name="60111-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I am grateful. I have had a hint that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, wishes to speak before I withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60111-37_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I apologise for disrupting the order in which things ought to happen. I wanted to ask the Minister about the previous reports of the independent monitor, which she said that the Government had responded to. My impression from looking at the most recent report of the independent monitor is that responses to a number of reports were outstanding. I refer particularly to paragraph 121 of the report of February 2005, in which the monitor deals with some recommendations based on her examination of the 2002 files on a new format for decision-making. I shall not go into the details, because several elements are outlined in the paragraph.


</p>

<a name="60111-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>If one turns to appendix C, which is a summary of the recommendations already made by the independent monitor in 2004, you find that the same set of parameters about how the entry clearance officer should handle their cases is repeated. The implication of that is that nothing has happened between the recommendations made in 2004 and the February 2005 report of the independent monitor. There were 52 paragraphs of recommendations in the June report of 2004, which are dealt with in appendix C, and 46 in November 2004. I have not counted the number made in February 2005. We are looking at a list of 100 recommendations. If they have been responded to by the Government, that has disappeared into a black hole somewhere. I am not conscious of having seen them. Had the Government made any firm decisions that were useful in improving the quality of decision-making, we would have learnt about them in the debate, or our many advisers in the Immigration Law <br>&nbsp;<br>

The best thing that I can do is to pick this up in my discussion with my noble friend Lord Triesman. My understanding is that the recommendations are fed into the review of the workings of UK visas, which is important. I am not sure that the Government will always agree with every recommendation in any event, as the noble Lord will expect, but I take the point. I have already indicated that I know that there is an outstanding formal reply, but I will pick up the point and inform him definitely of the position.

&quot;(b)   section 92(3C) applies.&quot;

<p><a name="st_34"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 6 deals with rights of appeal against refusal of leave to enter for those who arrive at a UK port. It will mean that those whose right of appeal is currently in-country will henceforth have only an out-of-country right of appeal after they have left the United Kingdom. Those who currently have an out-of-country right of appeal&#151;those refused on the basis of the purpose of their visit&#151;will have no appeal at all. There will of course be no independent check on whether cases are properly categorised as being about the purpose of the visit, because of the lack of a right of appeal. Rights of appeal on grounds of asylum, human rights and race discrimination are obviously preserved.
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Moreover, Clause 6 would reverse the current burden of proof. It assumes that a person arriving at a port has a purpose in entering other than that for which entry clearance has been granted by an entry clearance officer abroad, and places the burden on the person to show that that is not the case. Our amendment is to probe the Government&#039;s intention on the clause. The effect is to preserve the status quo, as set out in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, whereby a passenger who arrives with a valid entry clearance and is then refused entry to the United Kingdom has a right of appeal from within the country before removal, unless the reason for refusal is that entry is sought for a purpose other than that for which the clearance was granted, in which case the person has a right of appeal from outside the country after removal.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC92"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC92</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The amendment achieves that by: removing new Section 89(1)(b) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, inserted by Clause 6, which would deny a right of appeal altogether to a person refused entry on the basis that the entry is being sought for a purpose other than that for which the clearance was granted; and replacing that with a cross-reference to Section 92(3C) of the 2002 Act, which provides for an out-of-country appeal in such circumstances. The amendment also provides an opportunity to probe the Government on why they seek to deny any right of appeal to those refused on the grounds that the purpose of the trip is not the same as that specified in the entry clearance, denying any chance to challenge the immigration officer&#039;s decision.
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Clause 6 looks difficult and technical and, perhaps for those reasons, has attracted little attention to date. However, the situations that it covers are easy to understand. A person arrives at a UK port or airport, having already obtained a visa where one is required. He or she has satisfied the entry clearance officer as to the purpose of the trip and has gone to the trouble and expense of making arrangements for it, which may be envisaged as prolonged, both in sorting out matters at home and in making arrangements in the United Kingdom. He or she has paid for a ticket and has undertaken the journey. Then, on arrival in the UK, the person is refused entry. The amendment is about what happens next.
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The current position does not give everybody a right of appeal. For example, there is no right of appeal for students entering for a course of study of less than six months duration who are refused entry. Under Clause 6, a person refused entry on grounds that the purpose of the visit is not the same as that specified in the entry clearance will have no right of appeal, whether within or out of the country. He or she will be sent home, with no redress. That replaces the current position, where the person has a right of appeal after removal. If entry is refused on any other ground, the person will have a right of appeal, but not within the United Kingdom. The right of appeal will be after removal. The current position is that such an appeal would take place within the United Kingdom. That matter was discussed at some length in the House of Commons. Unfortunately, at that stage, the amendment was incorrect, and I understand that the Minister there had a field day and more or less gave it short shrift. I hope that my contribution will put that right.
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The purpose of a visit may not be easy to determine. It demands a subjective decision, in contrast to statements made by Ministers that the intention in moving to the points system is to focus on objective decision-making. This is another clause that recalls the primary purpose rule in marriage cases, repealed by the Government in 1997. It is difficult to satisfy a court of someone&#039;s intention when they are not available to give oral evidence. The clause removes any right of appeal at all where the refusal is on the basis of the purpose of the visit. Worse than that, new Section 89(1)(b) puts the onus on the person coming to satisfy the immigration officer that the purpose of the visit is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC93"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC93</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the same as that specified in the leave to enter. It thus starts from the presumption that the purpose is not the same.
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The arriving passenger will already have satisfied the entry clearance officer overseas of the purpose of the visit and that he or she meets all the requirements of the immigration rules. In those circumstances it is wrong to place the burden of proof on the person arriving, as is done by the clause. If an immigration officer at a port in the United Kingdom is considering taking away a status already granted by a colleague, there should be safeguards. These are entry cases where the disruption to the person refused is the maximum it could be, because they have already travelled.


</p>

<a name="60111-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>If you refuse someone on the basis that the purpose of their visit is not the one specified in the entry clearance, they get no right of appeal, whereas if you refuse them on any other basis, they get a right of appeal. What check will there be that the refusal on the basis of purpose has been made and classified properly?
</p>

<a name="60111-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>Leaving out Clause 6 would have the same effect as Amendment No. 24. However, as our proposal is better drafted than the existing provision, we propose to amend Clause 6 rather than to leave it out entirely. I suggest to the Minister that she looks at the case that has been presented to see whether the Government would consider it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60111-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   The amendment gives me the opportunity to ask a question, although in doing so I shall probably display my profound ignorance. Is it the Government&#039;s intention to have two tiers of scrutiny for each person coming from a country for which visas are required? Let us assume that the person gets a visa in whatever country it is and then arrives at a port here. Is it totally exceptional for that person to be refused entry, having already obtained a visa? If the person can still be refused entry, that seems to devalue the whole principle of the visa system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60111-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   Does the Minister have any figures relating to what happens at the moment? As I understood the speech that the noble Lord made in moving the amendment, these people have a right of appeal at present. If they arrive at the port of entry and the immigration officer asserts that the purpose for which they are seeking leave to enter is different from that which was stated in the interview with the entry clearance officer, that person has a right of appeal at present. It would be useful to know how many appeals there have been under this heading of individuals who, on arriving at Heathrow or wherever, give the immigration officer an allegedly different story from the one contained in the entry certificate. How many of those cases have been successful on appeal?
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I find it difficult to imagine how the situation would arise. After all, the person who is coming for the visit has gone to the trouble of putting down his purpose in writing, of going to the entry clearance officer for interview and of providing the required <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC94</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

documentation. How on earth can it happen that, when he arrives at Heathrow, having applied for entry as a student, he suddenly alters his story and says that he is coming in as a visitor? I should have thought that the number of such cases would be minute and that it is hardly necessary for the Government to make this prescription to cope with the nuisance value and the small number of appeals that must be heard.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60111-38_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I will try to address the point briefly but, I hope, effectively. The position that exists now will exist in the future. If you have received clearance, having gone through the process when you applied, and are for some reason refused entry at the port of entry, you have a full right of appeal. The person who determines whether you have changed your status is you, not the entry clearance officer. If on arrival you say, &quot;Well, I was coming in as a student, but I&#039;ve decided that I want to work instead,&quot; you&#151;not the entry clearance officer&#151;have changed your story. It would not be for the entry clearance officer to make any judgment, so we are not going back to the bad old days. However, suppose you change your story and say, &quot;I was coming in as a student, I have gone through the process as a student and have a place at a university, but I do not want to do that any more&#151;I want to work in industry&quot;. In that case, you have no right of appeal, because you have to go back to the beginning and start the process again.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>That is right and proper, otherwise someone might go for the position that they thought that they could get in with, but on the doorstep say, &quot;Actually, I&#039;m not doing that any more&quot;. We would have no way of judging that. Of course, their rights in terms of human rights, asylum or discrimination always stand&#151;that is always the backdrop to what I say.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, I should say that there are not two levels. There is one level. We want to trust that the system is properly implemented on the ground. People who arrive with the right visa should of course be let in. If they choose to say, &quot;Actually, I&#039;ve changed my mind and want to do this instead&quot;, they do not have a right of appeal on that basis and have to start at the beginning. If for some reason&#151;I cannot think of one&#151;an entry clearance officer says, &quot;We&#039;ve received information about you and I am not going to let you in&quot;, the person has a full right of appeal if they have the right visa for the thing that they said that they were coming to do.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The amendment would do only what we think the Bill already does. As we think that Parliamentary Counsel has got it right, we will not accept the amendment, although I think that we are probably all in the same place on the issue. The same position will apply in future. I hope that that is as clear as it can be.

very small, but such circumstances could happen. We have to be as clear as we can about the position so that there is no misunderstanding. I would not like anyone to think that they can apply to come into the country, get the appropriate visa&#151;let us say to be a student&#151;make the long journey, which may cost a lot of money, and on the way or just before they arrive decide that they want to do something different and believe that their visa will get them in. That person would have incurred a huge expense, never mind that others might try to use the system to get into the country in an inappropriate way. We should be very clear and I believe that the provision is clear and absolutely right. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment on that basis.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>Page 4, leave out lines 33 to 35.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>The noble Lord said: I believe that Clause 7 is one part of the package announced by the Home Secretary to deal with the terrorist attack on 7/7 and subsequently inserted as a new clause in the Bill in another place. The majority of the Home Secretary&#039;s proposals appear at the end of the Bill under the heading &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;, but the proposal on appeal rights was placed in this part of the Bill. Therefore, Clause 7 is separated from its wider context, which of course includes the Terrorism Bill, and from its immediate context&#151;the provisions in this Bill on national security. In Committee in the Commons, it was taken with the other national security clauses and, on Report, it was not debated at all. The clause has now been considered by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its third report of the 2005 Session, which was printed on 28 November.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Amendment No. 25 ensures that an appeal against removal on the ground that a person should be recognised as a refugee is to be heard in the United Kingdom before the person is removed to his country of origin. It gives effect to the JCHR&#039;s recommendation in its report <i>Counter-Terrorism Policy and Human Rights</i> that an in-country right of appeal on asylum grounds should be preserved. The Government, on the other hand, assert that the person concerned ought to be denied the right to be considered as a potential refugee. That point was made in one of Mr McNulty&#039;s statements made in the Commons Standing Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State&#039;s decision to certify that removal would not breach the European Convention on Human Rights cannot however be appealed from within the UK on asylum grounds as a person who is a national security threat is excluded from the protection of the Refugee Convention&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 27/10/05; col. 299.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>That is precisely the point. But as the JCHR pointed out, this,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;presupposes the correctness of the Secretary of State&#039;s certificate that the person is a national security threat&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>We will debate exclusion when we reach Clause 52, but at this stage noble Lords may wish to remind themselves that the 1951 convention obliges states not to <i>refoule</i> a refugee&#151;a person at risk of persecution on return&#151;and that a person can be excluded from recognition as a refugee only on certain limited grounds such as that they committed crimes against humanity or acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Even if a person is not excluded from recognition as a refugee, as detailed in Article 33(2) of the 1951 convention, in exceptional circumstances,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;a person whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>is not protected by the non-<i>refoulement</i> provisions. The convention thus enables a state to withhold protection from a person who does not deserve it or who threatens national security, but it presupposes that either there are objective reasons for concluding that a person falls within one of the exclusion classes or the allegation that he is excludable within the convention is capable of being judicially tested.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>In the case of a particularly serious crime, as noble Lords will remember, the Government listed what the offences in question were in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Specification of Particularly Serious Crimes) Order 2004. Although at the time we criticised some of the details of that order, we had to accept that Parliament agreed with the Government in their interpretation of that part of the exclusion wording in the convention, and that the list of offences was valid within the limits of our obligations under that convention.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>But here we are being asked to agree that by the fiat of the Secretary of State in the certificate, a person is to be denied the right to contest the allegations on which his exclusion is based, and this we do not accept. Since there is almost certainly to be an in-country hearing on human rights anyway, there can be no argument for this process on the grounds of extradition. I hope that now the Government have had time to consider the advice of the JCHR, they will give in gracefully on this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 26 would be that the appeal against removal on the grounds that such a return would breach the appellant&#039;s right not to be subjected to torture on return will be heard before the asylum and immigration tribunal, not before SIAC, while the out-of-country national security case will be heard before SIAC. That allows us to demonstrate that appeals under Clause 7 constitute a two-stop process contrary to the principle which has been laid down many times by the Government in our discussions on the Bill. In Standing Committee in another place, the Government reaffirmed that they would not export risk, yet that is exactly what they are doing here. People leave the UK before it has been determined whether they are a threat to this country and, if so, whether they ought, for example, to be arrested and prosecuted in this jurisdiction.

</p>

<a name="60111-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Amendment No. 26 is probing in nature and invites the Government to confront the fact that hearing the national security case after the applicant has left the UK is indefensible because it exports risk. It cannot work because it is not possible to divide the human rights and the national security evidence in the case, and because it creates a two-stop appeal process entailing duplication and expense. We say that almost invariably the human rights case is inseparable from the national security issues. It may be the very fact that the case involves national security that, coupled with the disclosed evidence in the human rights case, puts the individual at risk in his own country. If all or any of the national security information is in the possession of the applicant it may well be aired in his or her own evidence in the human rights appeal, resulting in substantial repetition between the in-country and overseas hearings. If the information is in the possession of only the Secretary of State, the situation is even worse because the person will have been returned to his or her own country at the point when the information that put him at risk of torture from his government is disclosed; and thus he would have no protection. The UK may also discover too late that this is someone who should have been tried and prosecuted for the protection of the UK and the international community rather than being allowed to leave our jurisdiction.

</p>

<a name="60111-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>With these two amendments we are also discussing the Question that Clause 7 stand part. Here we oppose the principle that a national security case against an appellant is to be heard out of country, with only the other human rights implications of return being dealt with before the person leaves the UK. We want to retain the status quo whereby the whole case is heard prior to removal, in accordance with the Government&#039;s approach everywhere else in this Bill of moving to a one-stop process. The Minister made the extraordinary statement in Standing Committee that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;The new clause is designed to streamline the process of appeals against deportation orders in national security cases&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 27/10/05; col. 298.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>It clearly does nothing of the kind. For that reason only, if no other, it should be removed.
</p>

<a name="60111-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>We also agree with the policy that was originally stated by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, during the proceedings on the 2002 Act, and I can imagine before that as well, and which was reaffirmed by Mr McNulty in Standing Committee that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;we shall not use the powers to export risk&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 27/10/05; col. 271.]</p>

</p>

<a name="60111-38_para18"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Perhaps I may conclude by giving the outline of one deportation case under existing law, where the appeal to SIAC covered both human rights and security issues. The evidence disclosed by the Secretary of State against the appellant&#151;I will call him &quot;Mr Ahmed&quot;, but I will give the Minister his Home Office reference later because I do not want to disclose his identity; it would not be proper for me to do so&#151;was that he was believed to be an associate of al-Qaeda supporters. In other words, he was not alleged to be a supporter of al-Qaeda, but merely an associate of people who were the supporters of that organisation. He was suspected of being involved in terrorist offences in his own country. He denied all these allegations and argued that, having been labelled as a suspected terrorist, he would be at risk of torture if sent back. A few days before the SIAC hearing the Secretary of State withdrew the decision to deport him, accepting that he would be at risk of torture. The national security and human rights aspects of the case were closely interlinked, but without the open evidence on the national security aspects the Article 3 case could not have been made, and the risk of torture would not have been examined.

<a name="60111-38_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Under this clause Mr Ahmed would have been returned to his country, where the national security case would have been disclosed and the risk that Mr Ahmed would have been tortured, which has now been acknowledged by the Government, would have materialised. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Clause 7 is designed to try and speed up removal where a decision to make a deportation order is certified by the Secretary of State as having been taken on the grounds of national security. We believe it is important to make the system work efficiently and effectively. These are of course highly sensitive cases. Our view is that any appeal against such a decision should only be exercised following removal from the United Kingdom. The exception to that is where the party affected by the order claims that his removal would breach his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.


</p>

<a name="60111-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>In such cases, as the noble Lord indicated, the appeal will be heard prior to removal save where the Secretary of State certifies that removal would not breach the proposed deportee&#039;s human rights. To ensure compatibility with our international obligations, the clause also makes provision for an in-country right of appeal to SIAC against any decision by the Secretary of State to issue such a certificate. We believe that that will ensure that any human rights issues raised by a proposed deportee will be fully considered prior to removal.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>On Amendment 25, as the noble Lord said, the clause deliberately does not provide an in-country right of appeal on asylum grounds. A person who is a <br>&nbsp;<br>

national security threat is excluded from the protection of the refugee convention. Even if the person is a refugee, Article 33.2 of the convention allows their expulsion from the country of refuge if they threaten its national security.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The particular issue that the noble Lord raised is answered by what happened in the Ullah judgment, with which I am sure he is familiar. Perhaps I can take a moment of the Committee&#039;s time to explain the relevance of the case. The case involved a claimant who entered the United Kingdom from Pakistan and applied for asylum, claiming to have a fear of persecution because of his religious beliefs. The claim was refused and the appeal dismissed on the basis that the claimant did not have a well founded fear. The applicant also argued that removal would give rise to a breach of his right to freedom of religion under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The relevance of Clause 7 is that the House of Lords, in considering the issue, found that where removal of an individual from the United Kingdom would result in treatment in the receiving state that would amount to a flagrant breach of any other article of the European Convention on Human Rights, such as to amount to a complete denial of the right in question&#151;as was being argued in this case&#151;it would be possible for removal to breach the sending state&#039;s obligation under the convention, notwithstanding that the treatment in the receiving state would not breach Article 3.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The judgment now ensures that there are no circumstances in which a person could be returned in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights but in breach of the refugee convention. Prior to the Ullah judgment, of course, it could be argued that there were certain sorts of persecution that fell outside the scope of Article 3. We believe that, in this part of the Bill, because of the way in which the House of Lords determined that judgment, there is no question but that the issues are effectively covered and that there is not a gap, if I may describe it as such. The protection afforded by the ECHR is sufficiently wide to ensure that, where removal would not breach our obligations under that convention, it would also be compatible with the 1951 refugee convention. I will, of course, send the noble Lord more details of the judgment if that would be of use, but that is the basis on which the clause is framed as it is on that particular aspect. Of course, Clause 7 already provides for a full out-of-country appeal against the decision to make the deportation order. Any claim to refugee status can be considered at that stage.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>With Amendment No. 26, the noble Lord raises the question whether the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, rather than SIAC, should hear any appeal. Our view is that SIAC is well and best placed to deal with what is, as the noble Lord said, the potential for a two-part appeal. I believe that, in these circumstances, that is the right way forward. SIAC has the expertise to do that effectively; it would not necessarily need to consider the national security case in any appeal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC100"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC100</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

against a decision by the Secretary of State to certify that removal would not breach the ECHR. It is also our view that SIAC would hold the part of the appeal against the certification in open session. Because SIAC also deals with the other issues, it would be the appropriate place to determine all these questions. It already has considerable expertise in dealing with human rights issues at appeal. It is a court of superior record, with a distinguished judge, Mr Justice Ouseley, as its president. Its membership includes legally qualified members or former members of the AIT. We believe that it is the appropriate place for such a hearing. It also has a smaller volume of cases than the AIT, which could be important in those cases. We think therefore, that that is the appropriate approach.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>I hope that, with my description of what happened with the Ullah case, I have dealt with Amendment No. 25.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>On Amendment No. 26, we think that it is much better for the process to be handled by SIAC, which could take all the questions into account, including that which the noble Lord raised about exploitation of risk. We must recognise that, although we can prosecute, that is our preferred option. We have control orders and a variety of available measures, of which this would be one. We are in dialogue with other countries about dealing with terrorists. I am sure that that would be a pertinent part of the discussion.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Underlying one of the concerns, as applied in the case that the noble Lord cited, was that somebody having had this raised would then be in danger. SIAC can take that into account in its considerations. I hope that I have answered that as fully as I can and that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.

It is an additional reason why I think that we should not be in Grand Committee at all. Here is an extremely important matter of principle on which we are unable to ask for the opinion of our colleagues. In the circumstances, all I can say is that the noble Baroness has not satisfied me. I do not think that the case she cited where the person was at risk of persecution because of his religious convictions was relevant to the case that I made on Amendment No. 25, nor did she cope with the possibility that a person in the situation of Mr Ahmed, whose case I outlined in Amendment No. 26, would not have suffered if this Bill had been in operation and if he had been unable to cite the reasons that I gave.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>The noble Lord said: The effect of the amendment would be to remove the Government&#039;s power to repeal the clause. I am sure that your Lordships might ask why we are now opposing subsection (4), which gives the Government power to repeal a provision that we have just said is objectionable and ought not to be included in the Bill. I have to offer an explanation before I discuss the amendment. We are trying to get the Government to come clean on the reason for wanting subsection (4) as part of the clause.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>In Commons Committee it was shown that the Government were looking forward to a situation where the existing regime of international protection from torture may be seriously weakened. They want to persuade the European Court of Human Rights to depart from its jurisprudence that the prohibition on torture is absolute and that the prohibition on returning people to a country where they are at real risk of torture is also absolute. This matter is also discussed by the JCHR in its third report of session 2005&#150;06 <i>Counter-Terrorism Policy and Human Rights</i> at paragraphs 123 to 152. A particularly important case that was cited by the committee was Chahal, where the Government wished to return to India a man who they had identified as being a threat to national security. The UK Government argued that the prohibition on return to a place where a person would be at real risk of torture was not absolute in national security cases and that removal of those who pose a threat on national security grounds should still be allowed. The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights rejected that argument in these words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;Article 3 enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society. The Court is well aware of the immense difficulties faced by States in modern times in protecting their communities from terrorist violence. However, even in these <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC102</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>circumstances, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment . . . Article 3 makes no provision for exceptions . . . The activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The court also rejected UK attempts to rely on assurances from the Indian Government that they would not torture Mr Chahal on return. I know that my noble friend Lord Lester, who has just entered the Grand Committee, intends to go into Chahal in much greater detail and with much greater legal knowledge than I have. In the mean time, I will give him a chance to catch his breath.
</p>

<a name="60111-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>As recently as 26 July last year in <i>N</i> v <i>Finland </i> the court followed Chahal, and the UK Government would like to persuade the court now to change its mind and have already sought to do so in a case against the Netherlands. The Home Secretary told the JCHR that it was not the Government&#039;s intention to amend the Human Rights Act to give effect to the balancing test, although the committee noted that the Prime Minister had given evidence that was less reassuring. The Prime Minister wanted to get into a position where the European Court would be satisfied with the memoranda of understanding that we are signing with various countries including Jordan, Libya, Egypt and Algeria, countries which are not well recommended as being free of torture, and maybe other countries that are not on the list yet that also torture people. The idea is that in these memoranda of understanding it will be agreed that if we send people back to those countries they will refrain from torturing them. That is what Mr McNulty meant when he said in Commons Committee:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;Case law on article 3 may change in the near future to allow the risk of persecution to be balanced against the danger to national security. An assessment will be made on whether removal would breach article 3. As a result, SIAC may be required to examine the substance of the national security case&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 27/10/05; col. 300.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>As the JCHR noted in its report, there are no indications that the ECHR is at all likely to change its jurisprudence. Chahal was, after all, decided by the Grand Chamber in the specific context of the Government&#039;s having judged the appellant to be a terrorist threat. One would like to know whether Mr Chahal has done anything since that judgment that has resulted in threats to national security. One would say, if he is living quietly in Birmingham or wherever, that that shows that the Government did not have a case to send him back to India. The recent House of Lords judgment in <i>A(GC) and ors</i>, on torture evidence, reaffirming the prohibition on torture and citing Chahal with approval, provides further reason to challenge the Government&#039;s rationale for the subsection.

<a name="60111-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>We doubt whether it is possible to establish a system of memoranda of understanding, backed by effective monitoring arrangements and effective sanctions against breaches of MOUs that would satisfy the European Court of Human Rights.

<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60111-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I apologise that I could not be here for half of the speech by my noble friend. I put my name to the amendment to give me an opportunity to explain why the Government are misconceived in exercising their undoubted right to go to Strasbourg to seek to persuade the European Court to dilute or reverse its judgment in the Chahal case. It is an unfortunate thing to be doing, although the Government are perfectly entitled to do it. I do not think that seeking to do so sets a good example by a country with a very fine record. On my recent travels I did not get the impression in other European states that there was the slightest enthusiasm for what the Government are doing, even in countries that for political reasons have agreed to ally themselves with the British Government in their intervention in the Dutch case. Perhaps I could explain extremely briefly, especially because my noble friend has covered most of the legal ground, why I take that view. Anyone who wishes to see more detail will find it in the opinion that was expressed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member, in our third report, HL Paper 75-1, particularly in the section between paragraphs 147 and 151.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>The basic proposition is not difficult to understand&#151;the prohibition against torture is absolute; there are no exceptions. The Government accept that that is so. That absolute prohibition is part of our common law, Scottish common law, English common law and goes right back to the seventeenth century, as the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, pointed out in our recent debate. Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights probably owes as much to that British tradition, north and south of the border, as it does to a wider European tradition. It is perfectly clear that the prohibition against torture is not only written in the European Convention on Human Rights and in several treaties including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture, by which we are bound, all of which state it in absolute terms, but it is also binding now in customary international law, the law of nations, which does not require a treaty. It is what is known in Latin as <i>jus cogens</i>, a binding international legal standard. The question is: how on earth can that absolute prohibition be qualified when it is unqualified in customary international law and unqualified in international treaty law? My view, which is supported fortunately by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, is that it cannot be qualified.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>There is no balance between the prohibition against torture on the one hand and the threat to national security on the other, in legal terms. Fortunately, the issue has been decided not only by the European Court in Chahal and subsequent case law and in the UN treaty bodies, as my noble friend has pointed out, but it has also been decided after detailed argument last summer by the Supreme Court of New Zealand of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC104"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC104</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

seven judges headed by Chief Justice Sian Elias, a formidable jurist of a great court. It considered all these questions and looked at the only case in the Government&#039;s favour, a Canadian case called Suresh, and it unanimously concluded that you could not balance the absolute prohibition against torture, even when confronting really evil people who are threats to the national security of the nation. You cannot submit them to the risk of torture if sent to another country.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>That leaves altogether out of the equation the separate question that my noble friend has raised, which is a more difficult question. The easy question is, &quot;Will the Government possibly win in Strasbourg?&quot;. The easy answer is, &quot;No, they will lose&quot;. They must know that they are going to lose, and they are going through the motions. The reason it is going through the motions I suggest is because after the atrocities in this country the Prime Minister said that the rules of the game must change, and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said that judges might have to be instructed to interpret Article 3 differently. As a cosmetic device it was decided to go to Strasbourg in a quixotic way to tilt at windmills. That is what the Government are doing, and, unless I am very much mistaken, they are bound to lose. I see the Minister shaking her head. She and I are in an important contest against each other as to which of us is Peer of the year, and therefore we must be careful how we stake our reputations. Although she should certainly win that contest&#151;and I will probably be shown to be an idiot here&#151;but on this issue I predict that the Government will certainly lose, at any rate by a large majority in the Grand Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The more difficult question is about memoranda of understanding. I do not take the completely dogmatic position that is taken by human rights NGOs. I think that there are circumstances in which a very difficult question has to be faced, which they do not face. The difficult question is this: suppose you have a really evil person, and suppose that person is someone who you have evidence against but not sufficient to try them in this country, and suppose they are alleged to have committed very serious crimes in a horrible other country, and suppose that country has in the past practised torture, but suppose that country then were to agree that under no circumstances will it do so and it will give clear conditions of a fair trial. Would that be something that violated our international human rights standards? That is before the Joint Committee on Human Rights at the moment, and that is one of the reasons we have recently taken trips to Paris and Madrid to see how those issues are confronted in France and Spain.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>Speaking purely personally and not on behalf of the committee, I was disappointed in hearing some of the evidence from some of the NGOs. When asked, &quot;Would you take part in monitoring these agreements?&quot; the answer was that under no circumstances would they do so. If that position is being taken by the human rights movement, of which I am a part, the practical question is, &quot;What would you do? Would you lock such a person up indefinitely without trial? Would you put them under house arrest? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC105"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC105</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Would you tag them? Would you put them under close surveillance? What would you do, given those assurances?&quot;
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>That question is not raised by Clause 7 at all. As I understand it, that clause is there in the event that the Government were to win in Strasbourg. If I were the advocate against the Government in Strasbourg, I would use Clause 7 as part of my argument, because the very way in which Clause 7 is structured shows the danger of a government victory on this question. It would weaken the prohibition against torture where national security interests were involved, and it would do so procedurally in a way that would, in my view, be destructive of the protection given by Article 3 of the European convention and Article 3 of the torture convention.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>In a way that is beside the point because I am not now saying whether it is sensible to have it there. It is not sensible, and I would prefer not to have it there for the simple reason that we should come back to it through primary legislation and debate it properly if that arose. At this stage, all that I am saying is that it is a very great pity in terms of our international reputation that we are seeking to undermine one of the truly great landmark jurisprudence cases, Chahal, in Strasbourg, for short-term partisan, political reasons. That damages our credibility in the rest of the world. It is very hard to explain that on the one hand we are totally against torture&#151;we have a fine record&#151;but on the other we want to qualify the prohibition by balancing it against national security. If the Minister thinks that I am wrong, I beg her to read the judgments of the New Zealand Supreme Court, which I hope will convince her. If they do not convince her, I certainly hope that they will convince the judges in Strasbourg in the way that they have convinced the judges in New Zealand. For those reasons, I support the thrust of the amendment.

that I am a justice Minister as part of the Justice and Home Affairs team in Europe. With the Home Secretary, I spend some of my working life talking to my colleagues across the European Union. This has been one of the issues that I have discussed in a number of counties in visits that I made during our presidency. Though not every country would see this as a priority for them, the noble Lord will know that as well as the UK joining the Dutch case, Lithuania, Portugal and Slovakia have also joined it. It is not fair to say, certainly among European Union colleagues, that our reputation has been damaged. People may not believe that it is the right thing to do, and others may not think that it is appropriate for them to do, but they have understood what we are seeking to do and have taken a positive view about the UK having the right to do that. Certainly in terms of the European Union I would challenge that.

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The noble Lord sent me the New Zealand judgment some time ago. I wish I had brought it with me, but it is at home. I had forgotten that the noble Lord would raise it; no doubt the noble Lord has got it with him. I am sure that the judgment is an important factor, but only a factor, in the deliberations that will take place in the European Court.

</p>

<a name="60111-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>I have something else to say about the original Chahal judgment from the perspective of the Government. Noble Lords more closely involved than myself will know the judgment was made in 1996. It was about the absolute nature of Article 3. There were 17 judges in the Grand Chamber, and seven of them took a different view. Their statements in part have led us to decide to join in the Dutch case, because those statements suggested that there was an alternative view that should be thought of. Seven out of 17, I submit, is a suitably large number on which it is right and proper to consider carefully what that minority view has said.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The case that is currently going through is from the Netherlands, and the Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner, who has been a good friend and colleague of the UK for as long as he has been a Justice Minister, has discussed this with us and he has participated in allowing us to join in that discussion. It is clear that we are there to look at whether there is the ability to have the balancing test. This is an important opportunity to deal with this. I understand that the Dutch Government have been given until 24 January to respond to a variety of interventions that have been made in this case by a number of non-governmental organisations. We do not know what will happen: the Chamber could consider the case on the basis of the documents that they have already received, have oral hearings, or relinquish it to the Grand Chamber. Either of the latter options would result in a delay. As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, will know far better than I, the issue would need to come before the Grand Chamber if Chahal is to be overturned, if the Chamber considers the case as an opportunity to consider an appeal to the Grand Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para11"></a>

individuals contrary to our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. But we are equally clear that where individuals threaten our national security, and we can remove them compatibly with our international obligations, it should happen as quickly as possible. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, supports, and was kind in putting that forward to the Committee, the work that is going on in memoranda of understanding. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, who has played a role in that, as noble Lords will know. Memoranda have been agreed with the governments of Jordan and Libya, and negotiations are underway with Algeria and Lebanon. The purpose of the memoranda is to make sure, on a case by case basis, that we are able to get reassurances about the treatment of an individual who would be returned. It would be for our courts to determine whether they are satisfied with the evidence that we put forward on that basis. That is an important safeguard in the memoranda, and we take it very seriously. They are evidence to be weighed up alongside any other evidence, but it is important to have them.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>In being able to say to the courts, &quot;We have an agreement that if the individual is returned to their country they will not suffer degrading or inhumane treatment or torture&quot;, and that that agreement has been well made and the appropriate monitoring arrangements are in place, the courts would be able to look at that as evidence. We think that that is right and proper. We see no reason why it should not be the basis on which good discussions can take place and where the courts can take that into account. The agreements are made at the highest level and should be treated with the seriousness with which I am sure your Lordships&#039; House would treat them.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>In addition, we felt it right to intervene in the case to test whether the minority judgment, as it was, could be reviewed and the court come to a different decision. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, is absolutely clear in his own mind that the Government will fail. We thought very carefully before we intervened, but, on reflection and on looking at what the seven judges said, we believe that this issue needed to be tested and that if it were tested it would enable us to consider the question of national security. There is nothing that a government is more challenged to do: I would argue that the first duty of a government is the protection of its citizens. We would be wrong not to consider this issue properly.
</p>

<a name="60111-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is right that the purpose behind the subsection is that if the case were successful it would enable us to deal with the new case law from the European Court of Human Rights. I ask Members of the Committee to consider that the basis on which the Government are doing this is right and appropriate. We are working closely with our partners across Europe and beyond to deal with terrorism as effectively as possible. It is right and proper to consider carefully judgments in Strasbourg, not only in the context of the majority view but also the substantial minority view and to test that out. In dealing with a few individuals who could potentially be extremely <br>&nbsp;<br>

dangerous to this nation, we must take those responsibilities seriously. That is what we have done. Win or lose, the Government are right to consider this. If we are successful, it is right to use this mechanism to enable us to enact what would be the new case law in Strasbourg. I hope that I have answered satisfactorily and that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60111-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I am extremely grateful to the Minister. She has certainly answered, but whether she has answered satisfactorily depends on one&#039;s point of view. The reason that I am not convinced is made clear in the JCHR report. It will save a lot of time if I use that as an aid. Paragraph 149 is quite brief, and in it we explained what the minority said in Chahal:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;The minority in Chahal held that States are entitled under Article 3 to balance the extent of the potential risk of ill-treatment of the deportee on the one hand against the threat to their national security on the other. In other words, on the minority&#039;s view, a State is entitled to expel an individual on national security grounds even where there is a substantial risk of torture or ill-treatment in the receiving country.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>That is the proposition that the Government now contend for and on which they lost in Chahal. The committee goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;In our view, it follows from the Government&#039;s acceptance of the absolute nature of the torture prohibition that considerations of national security cannot be balanced against the risk of torture, because that presupposes returning somebody to a risk of torture because national security trumps their right not to be tortured&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I do not understand what the Government&#039;s answer to that is. It is no use saying, &quot;That was the minority; maybe that will become the majority&quot;. The question is how the Government will answer our argument that in their view of Article 3 you could send someone back to a country where there is a substantial risk of torture, even though another provision of the torture convention specifically says that you cannot send someone to a country where there is a substantial risk of torture. I do not understand how the Government can square that circle. That is why their case is hopeless, because they seek to read into an absolute prohibition a balance, the result of which would enable them to send someone, however much they said they would not, to a country where they face the risk of torture.
</p>

<a name="60111-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The only other point that I want to make is that it is not just in Chahal that the court reached that conclusion. As we say in footnote 138, in subsequent cases such as <i>Selmouni</i> v <i>France</i> in 1999, <i>V </i>v <i>UK</i> in 1999, <i>Labita</i> v <i>Italy</i> in 2000, each time the court has reaffirmed the Chahal judgment. It has done it three times, and it has done it recently. Those are my two points. First, how the Government answer our criticism of the minority judgment as leading to a breach of the torture convention as well as the European Convention on Human Rights by exposing someone to the risk of torture in another country. The other is, how can one think that the court will change its mind when it has not only decided in Chahal in a majority judgment but done it unanimously&#151;as far as I am aware it was done unanimously, but I may be wrong about that&#151;in three subsequent cases involving France, the UK and Italy respectively? That is why, with respect, this is an exercise in futility.

<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="60111-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Lord makes his case very well, but I will make two points. First, in the subsequent cases, presumably the relevant people looked back at the Chahal case as being the case in which the judgment was made. I would expect those judges to say that there was a precedent. Secondly, the UK has never intervened in a case to say why we believe it should be reviewed. That, surely, should be allowed. We are seeking to do this properly through the European Court; we are not trying to take unilateral action. I argue that the subsequent cases based their decisions on the Chahal case because that is the effect of a precedent in law. I talk as a non-lawyer so I am on dangerous territory, but I think that is right. Along with other European Union countries, we have never had the chance to make our case. We would like to do that, as we believe it is worth considering. Torture is not the only thing in Article 3. It also refers to inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. The court may need to consider all the different ways in which that could be interpreted.
</p>

<a name="60111-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>The noble Lord indicated that he supported the memorandum of understanding. I refer to the circumstances that the court in Strasbourg may determine are appropriate and relevant where the measure could be taken into account. As regards saying that you do not send people back to somewhere where they will be tortured, if you have a good memorandum of understanding with certain conditions in place&#151;which says that that will not happen&#151;perhaps that is something that could be considered. The present provision is absolute and we believe that certain issues are not being properly addressed. We have sought to address them through a memorandum of understanding with our domestic courts testing the matter properly and appropriately for the individuals concerned. We have sought to ask the court to look again at the Chahal judgment. I believe that what we have done is right and valid. As I said, win or lose, it is a responsibility of this Government to ensure that we protect our citizens. This measure is an important part of that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="60111-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I hope that I may make another point without tiring the Committee. I am not suggesting that the Government are acting improperly; they are perfectly entitled to do what they are doing. However, I am suggesting that what they are doing is politically driven and is doomed to failure for the reasons I have given, but that is a different matter.
</p>

<a name="60111-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Further, I still have not had an answer to my question how you square the circle of saying on the one hand you would never send someone to a country where they faced the risk of torture, and yet on the other hand putting forward an argument to give you the right to do that. I have said that in principle I am not opposed to the idea of a memorandum of understanding. However, in practice everything would depend on whether the UK courts or the Strasbourg court in a particular case concerning a memorandum of understanding&#151;not in the Dutch case in which we <br>&nbsp;<br>

are intervening&#151;came to the conclusion that the memorandum of understanding meant that the decision-taker, that is, the Minister, was entitled to say that there would be no substantial risk of torture in sending the relevant person to the country concerned. But that will not arise as regards what is being argued in Strasbourg; that would be a question on a specific memorandum of understanding in the future. It failed in Chahal where there was not a proper memorandum of understanding sufficiently robust to convince that court. But that is a question of fact on evidence; what we are talking about is the principle&#151;should Article 3 be qualified by any balance in terms of national security? In my view the answer is firmly &quot;no&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60111-41_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The question is, should it be balanced and, if so, how? That may be an important factor which brings in the memorandum of understanding for our courts will look to Strasbourg, to some degree, in deliberating their views on the memorandum of understanding. I do not think that we can separate this process entirely. As for being politically motivated, yes, the protection of citizens is politically motivated. We are politicians; it is our job to make sure that we keep our nation safe. I make no apology whatever for that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60111-41_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   We do not really know what arguments the noble Baroness&#039;s colleagues will present at Strasbourg, but it sounds as though they will say, &quot;We believe that the protection of our citizens against the threat of terrorism is more important than the prohibition against torture in Article 3, and therefore we want to water down the protection&quot;. That protection is given not only through the many cases that my noble friend has mentioned but is, as he said, enshrined in customary international law. However, it seems the Government want to destroy that edifice because they think that the protection of our citizens is more important than our international obligations. I wonder whether that is really the case that the noble Baroness thinks will be made in Strasbourg because my noble friend has said that he cannot see any argument that would prevail in the face of the decisions that the court has made in the past. If that is the strength of the Government&#039;s case, it is inept in the extreme for them to go to Strasbourg and present such a feeble argument knowing that it will almost certainly fail.
</p>

<a name="60111-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>That is particularly the case when, as my noble friend has said, there is another route. It is not a route that I am particularly attracted by yet, because not only do you have to have waterproof memoranda of understanding, you also have to have mechanisms by which those memoranda are overseen. That has proved an impossible hurdle so far. I believe that as regards Jordan&#151;my noble friend will probably correct me if I am wrong&#151;originally we asked the ICRC whether it would be prepared to monitor the situation. It refused point blank, and we finished up with an organisation that no one has ever heard of and which a search on the Internet has not been able to identify. Whether we could go to the courts and plead that we had sufficiently watertight guarantees against torture <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC111"></a>

through the memorandum of understanding we have with Jordan being policed by some unknown and untested domestic NGO is doubtful.
</p>

<a name="60111-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Although I do not disagree with my noble friend that this route is worth exploring as a means of solving the dilemma if we can find adequate means of monitoring those agreements, that is not what the Government are asking us to do. The Government are seeking to water down the obligations that we and every other state have taken on under Article 3. I seriously submit that we ought to think again about this, because it is not simply a question of our own domestic protection but of the reputation of Europe as a whole. If we cancel or water down this very important obligation of the convention, it will be a very black day in the annals of this country for us to have taken the lead on such an initiative. I beg the Government to think again about going to Strasbourg and to concentrate on other routes by which they can solve this admittedly very difficult problem. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60111-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dholakia </b>   moved Amendment No. *27A:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>Page 6, line 7, leave out &quot;(2)(b) and&quot; and insert &quot;(2)&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I apologise for the rather late tabling of this amendment. I am well aware that Members of the Committee will not have had time to prepare briefings and so on. It should have been tabled in conjunction with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. However, having considered the contribution that he made on Monday, I felt that there were one or two issues that were not covered. It is right, therefore, that I move this amendment.
</p>

<a name="60111-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The amendment relates to Clause 11, which is headed, &quot;Continuation of leave&quot;. Its purpose is to give effect to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State&#039;s assurance that she would address the problem that, as the Bill is drafted, people refused an extension of leave, however quickly they leave the UK, risk having their passport endorsed with a note that they are an overstayer, a person who has breached the Immigration Rules, with consequences for future attempts to visit the UK or third countries. In other words, an endorsement of that nature would effectively ruin their future chances not only of visiting the UK but a number of third countries. The amendment would achieve its purpose by preserving subsection 3(2)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971, which provides for leave to continue on the same terms and conditions for the period during which an appeal against refusal could be lodged.
</p>

<a name="60111-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Clause 11 as a whole is objectionable. It will cause chaos for applicants, their employers, educational institutions and others, as well as for those seeking to administer immigration control. On Second Reading, the Minister appeared willing to address one of the problems when she said:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC112"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC112</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;Under Clause 13, someone who has been the subject of a removal decision will not be committing an offence during any time when an appeal against removal from inside the UK could be brought or is pending and will not be liable to have their passport endorsed on embarkation if they have complied with the terms of their leave. Anyone who has had leave refused or curtailed and embarks within any time that an appeal in-country could be brought, which is within 10 working days, would not be committing an offence. However, I shall look very carefully when we are in Committee to make sure that we have covered this point. It is not the purpose of the Bill to make people do something illegal accidentally&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/12/05; col. 579.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Our amendment tries to meet that pronouncement.
</p>

<a name="60111-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The reference to Clause 13 and to not committing an offence is worrying because it recalls some of the language to which members of all parties objected at Commons Report and Third Reading when the Minister of State, having promised to address the problem that Clause 11 as drafted made people overstayers the moment they were refused, merely came back and gave them immunity from prosecution by moving what is now Clause 13, rather than tackling all the problems of turning people into overstayers and putting them in what he himself called &quot;the twilight zone&quot;. The Minister of State himself said in Committee that it is very rare that overstayers are prosecuted. If the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State had merely been repeating this doublespeak, there would be little reassurance. However, she appeared to offer something more tangible in that she said that people would not have their passports endorsed.
</p>

<a name="60111-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Section 3C(2)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 provides that if a decision on refusing to vary a person&#039;s leave is not received until after the original leave has expired, leave continues on the same terms and conditions until the decision is received. Clause 11 does not change that. Section 3C(2)(b) makes similar provision for the period during which an appeal against refusal could be brought. Section 3C(2)(c) makes similar provision for the period during which any appeal made is pending. Clause 11 repeals both of them. Thus, if a person is refused, as is normal, after their original leave has expired, from the moment they receive that refusal they are overstayers. If they catch the plane that very evening to leave the UK the immigration officer at the airport could stamp their passport as an overstayer as they left. The immunity from prosecution under Clause 13 does not touch this. While immune from prosecution, they are still overstayers. They have, in the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State&#039;s words, done something illegally accidentally. It will be scant comfort to them to know that they cannot be prosecuted for it, if their passport is endorsed. Such an endorsement in their passport will adversely affect not only their chances of coming to the UK again, but also of going to other countries. The amendment therefore tests whether the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State was giving a promise worth having.


</p>

<a name="60111-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Subsection 3(2)(b), preserved by this amendment, provides for leave to continue on the same terms and conditions for the period&#151;10 days&#151;during which an appeal could be lodged. The amendment would mean that leave continued on the same terms and conditions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC113"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC113</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for the period of 10 days during which an appeal against it could be brought. Thus the person who embarked during those 10 days should not face having their passport endorsed. This may not get us very far: the passport will show only the original leave and there is a high chance that mistakes will be made and people&#039;s passports be endorsed anyway, but it would at least suggest that the very real problem created by the legislation is being taken seriously.

</p>

<a name="60111-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The Government may indicate that they cannot accept this amendment because if they did they could not make refusal and variation decisions simultaneously. That goes to the very heart of the problems that I have described. They have sought to give people a single right of appeal but the appeal they have picked on is against a decision that can be made only once a person is an overstayer. That is why we have suggested wholesale amendments to Clause 1, and different ways of achieving the one-stop variation appeal, as we were invited to do by the Minister.
</p>

<a name="60111-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>This amendment does nothing to address the problems faced by those who do not have a right of appeal under new Sections 82(2)(fa) and 82(2)(fb), inserted by Clause 1, but who none the less have an in-country right of appeal because it has been brought on human rights grounds. As soon as the 10-day period for appealing has expired, they will be overstayers and will remain so until the appeal is finally determined, losing rights to work and other entitlements, and facing detention and possible removal. Those are further reasons for the Government to remove Clause 11 as a whole and recognise that this system will cause chaos for everyone and form the basis of judicial reviews in the High Court and applications to the European Court of Human Rights under Article 13 of the ECHR. Those are the reasons for our amendment. I hope that on the basis of the Minister&#039;s comments at Second Reading, she will feel able to accept it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60111-42_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   As the noble Lord has indicated, the amendment provides for leave to continue following a decision to refuse to vary leave during any period in which an appeal against the decision could be brought. There are some technical problems with the amendment and it would not do what the noble Lord hopes. I refer to the relevant part of Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971, which refers to variation appeals only which are abolished by Clause 1(2) of this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I accept the importance of ensuring that those who comply with the terms of their leave and wish to challenge an adverse decision made in respect of them are not penalised for doing so. That is what Clause 13 is about. I repeat that we are committed to not endorsing the passports of those who remain in the UK to exercise an in-country right of appeal against a removal decision or who leave voluntarily following an adverse decision on a variation application. The critically important part of this, as I indicated on our previous Committee day, is that I am looking at the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC114"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC114</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provisions concerning variation appeals in Clause 1 in the light of the discussion that we had in Committee. If in-country rights of appeal were to be restored in variation cases, these issues simply would not arise. I will not say any more about that at this point because I am being brief. However, I hope that the noble Lord will accept the firm commitment on passports, the relevance of Clause 13 and that he will look again at the technical issues concerning the amendment. However, most importantly of all, I hope that he will note I have made it very clear that I intend to take away Clause 1 to consider in-country appeals again. I hope that on that basis the amendment can be withdrawn.

There is not a fall-back position for the Government if they do not. Is the Minister guaranteeing that there will be some alternative arrangements such as we discussed under Clause 1 which will make an amendment of this kind&#151;or the intention of the amendment&#151;unnecessary? If not, I do not see how the Minister can fulfil the undertaking not just to refrain from criminalising the people whom we are considering but also to ensure that stamps are not put in their passports. How else can that be ensured if the Minister is not successful in coming up with an alternative solution under Clause 1?

There will be plenty of opportunity therefore to return to this. The noble Lord quite rightly hinted that he does not want to wait until the Bill has gone through for me to say what is happening because that would be too late. That would be improper and I would not do it. I am very clear that the consideration around Clause 1 is taking place now. I will come back to the Committee at the earliest opportunity&#151;certainly, in plenty of time for Members to return to this question on in the House and deal with it appropriately. The noble Lord is right to say that if we were in that position before then, he could demand that I indicate precisely how we would make sure the passports were not endorsed and what the procedure and process would be, so that those people who would be affected would be absolutely clear. If that is the case, I undertake to do that.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60111-43_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Bridgeman </b>   moved Amendment No. 36:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>Page 7, line 37, leave out from &quot;he&quot; to end of line 41 and insert &quot;took reasonable steps to comply with any prescribed requirements in relation to the employment&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 36, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 37 and 38. The Explanatory Notes inform us that Clause 15 on employment penalties provides,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;that a person is liable to a penalty if he employs an adult subject to immigration control who has not been granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom o whose leave is invalid, has expired, or is subject to a condition preventing him from accepting the employment. An employer is excused from paying a penalty if he complies with the requirements of an order made by the Secretary of State. The excuse does not apply where the employer knew that his employment of the individual was unlawful&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>As an aside, I note that this refers only to adults and not children. It would also be interesting to know how this clause sits with the recommendation of the House of Lords EU Sub-Committee F report on economic migration.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a> As the Second Reading debate on this Bill highlighted, the employment of illegal immigrants can end in tragedy, as demonstrated only too well at Morecambe Bay. It is a problem that all sides of the House condemn. Lobbyists such as the Immigration Law Practitioners Association (ILPA) and the CBI support sanctions on employers in principle. Indeed, they welcome criminal offences for the deliberate employment of illegal workers. However, there remain serious concerns regarding the civil penalties proposed in this clause.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Those concerns were not fully addressed in the other place. As such, I have tabled Amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 38. I am sure that the Minister is fully aware of the CBI&#039;s views that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;civil penalties will create more problems than solutions&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>and that this clause as a whole is a &quot;distraction&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Indeed, I hope that she will take time in her reply to outline why sanctions already available under the 1996 Act have not been enforced more often and why the proposed changes will be any better, fairer or more efficient. How will it be enforced and by whom? I have read somewhere that there are to be only 12 enforcers. If that is true, it is hard to see how they will work against the tide of more than half a million illegal immigrants currently in our country.

<a name="60111-43_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Amendment No. 37 will excuse a first-time offender from a civil penalty if they co-operate fully with the enforcement officers, and are willing to take help and advice to avoid the repetition of the offence.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>All three amendments aim to lighten the onerous burden that the Bill currently places on employers, particularly small businesses, and those whom the Bill could catch unawares. They will also work against the very real risk of informal discrimination against all migrants, whether they are here lawfully or not, or are indeed British-born but&#151;for want of a better way of saying this&#151;&quot;look foreign&quot;. ILPA warns that discrimination in this context &quot;should not be underestimated&quot; and that it is &quot;ill understood by government&quot;. Furthermore, it suggests that the draft codes of practice, to which I am sure the Minister will refer, have not solved the problem&#151;indeed, they are apparently,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;little more than an expression of pious hope&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-43_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The Bill places a greater burden on businesses that are already swamped in endless red tape. The clause asks them to make increasingly complex document checks, costing them time and money, as well as increasing the likelihood of an innocent mistake being made.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>That is especially true of the requirement to check the legality of employees on an ongoing basis in subsection (7)(e) and not just the point of employment, a problem highlighted by the illegal working taskforce&#039;s regulatory impact assessment of the Bill. We have already established during debate that the Home Office asks that people do not apply for a variation&#151;including extension&#151;of leave more than 28 days before that leave is due to expire. Those applications can take a considerable amount of time to decide. Thus there is every chance that when an employer comes to conduct an ongoing check, the employee will not be able to present the relevant documentation, as it will be with the Home Office. As ILPA highlighted earlier, copies of documents in the employer&#039;s possession may show that leave was due to expire. What happens then? How can the employer discharge the obligations imposed on him by the clause? Will employers risk a breach in law or sack the individual concerned? Debates in the other place have offered no solution to that so far. Amendment No. 36 will allow the matter to be considered under the principle of reasonableness.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Similarly, Amendment No. 37 will aid the situation proposed above. It will act as a yellow card, ensuring that where honest mistakes have been made the <br>&nbsp;<br>

employer is helped to comply, not punished. Only if there is a repetition of negligence or failure to co-operate with the authorities should the penalties be imposed.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>The examples above demonstrate not only a real threat of discrimination, but the expectation that businesses will act as a continual watchdog on behalf of the Government. That is not their role. Yes, we should hold them to account for repeated actions involving illegal workers, but should not penalise the first innocent mistake, and should support them in their employment of legal workers. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="60111-43_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   With this amendment, we are also discussing Amendment No. 39, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Dholakia. What I have to say to some extent echoes what we have already heard from the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, because we have genuine anxieties about the requirements that have been placed on employers by the clause as a whole, and in particular about the obligations in paragraph (e), to which the noble Viscount has made reference.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>In Clause 15(7) there is an exhaustive list of matters that an order prescribing requirements imposed on the employee under subsection (3) may cover. To that extent it is mere verbiage, and is presumably designed to head off challenges to controversial provisions of any order as <i>ultra vires</i> primary legislation. But this requirement in paragraph (e) that employers undertake repeat checks is particularly controversial. In Commons Committee the Minister said that regular intervals would probably be on an annual basis, certainly not less than that. He went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;I accept the balance between getting the law right and avoiding undue burdens on businesses, but I do not accept that it is an undue burden to an employer to establish that he is not breaking the law by employing someone whose status here is not legal&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-43_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>That is all very well in theory, but in practice the obligation is likely to be an extremely difficult one for the employer to perform.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The Home Office does not let somebody apply for a variation, including an extension of leave, for more than 28 days before the previous leave is due to expire. Because those applications take a considerable length of time to process, it is probable that when an employer comes to carry out this repeat check at&#151;whatever&#151;an annual interval, the employee will not be able to present relevant documentation because it will be with the Home Office. Earlier copies of the document, which may be in the employer&#039;s possession, will show that leave was due to expire. What happens then? How can the employer discharge the obligation which is being imposed on him by this clause? How can the risk to the employer appearing to breach the law who sacks the employee be avoided?
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Neil Gerrard noted in the Committee concerning Clause 15(1)(b)(ii), making it illegal to employ someone whose leave had expired, that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;I am concerned that the sort of cases that I and probably other hon. Members currently see concern people who have temporary permission to be in the UK, perhaps through exceptional leave to <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC118"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC118</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>remain on a work permit, and have applied to extend it. I know that the Minister will tell me that decision making is improving, but suppose that someone with exceptional leave to remain makes an application for indefinite leave to remain, and the decision takes a considerable length of time and their leave to remain expires before a decision is given, how would they be affected by the measure?&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-43_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>The Minister, Mr McNulty in response gave him the assurance that he sought, that it would not be illegal to employ such people but noted that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;although subsection (1)(b)(ii) literally says &#039;has expired&#039;, that does not relate to those who apply in time and carry on. We are still considering the practicalities that are in place, not in terms of rules or legislation, but in terms of persuading an employer or anyone else that the other application has been made&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-43_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>And that is the crux of the matter. While the assurance on the substantive point was welcome, it fails to address the problems that are created by Clauses 1 and 11, that the employer would technically be acting illegally immediately such people are refused, if their original leave to remain had expired because under the Bill as drafted it is going to be illegal to employ them between refusal and appeal.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The recognition of the difficulties for employers in practice is also telling. There is the risk of injustice to individual employers who do their best to establish the position but find that impossible. There is a risk of them having to spend a great deal of time trying to establish what the correct position is, and, underlying everything, there is a real risk that if it is made too complicated to employ people who are subject to immigration control or who the employer thinks might be subject to immigration control, then the employment of migrants, both legal and illegal may be jeopardised. The illegal working taskforce regulatory impact assessment for the Bill acknowledged these problems. I will not quote from it but there is a lengthy explanation in paragraphs 53 and 54 of its report, which the Minister no doubt is familiar with. It outlines the theory. How do the Government expect to achieve all that in practice? It is very difficult to find one&#039;s way around immigration legislation. I just had to buy a copy of Margaret Phelan&#039;s new tome, which is about twice the size of its predecessor. The money I spent less than three years ago on Margaret Phelan&#039;s admirable work has gone up in smoke. It is a very expensive new edition, but, as one of my colleagues said, it is worth every penny.

</p>

<a name="60111-43_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Employers may have to find their way through a weighty tome in order to be sure that they are complying with the law, particularly&#151;and we shall come on to this later&#151;as there has been no consolidation since 1971. I do not know why the Minister is pointing at me. I did not want to discuss consolidation this afternoon because it is a separate issue, but I feel that employers do not have any chance of getting this right unless some help is given by the Minister this afternoon. The current employers&#039; helpline deals with general inquiries but it gives very little indication of how a helpline might work where one rings in to make inquires on individual files. Those who have had occasion to ring the Home Office with a query on an individual case will know that it is quite a challenge to manage and locate the file or to speak with <br>&nbsp;<br>

the person responsible for dealing with it. The most one is likely to get&#151;and not very quickly or easily&#151;is confirmation that a case is under consideration.
</p>

<a name="60111-43_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>So I hope that the Minister has fully taken on board the difficulties which this clause is going to impose on employers and that she will have a satisfactory explanation of how the Government intend to solve that problem.

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   This group of amendments contains Amendments Nos. 36 and 38. The Committee will see that this side supports the amendments of the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I wish to stress two points briefly. On Amendment No. 36 our attention has been drawn by the Immigration Law Practitioners&#039; Association to the fact that there are particular problems for employers making repeat checks as when a person&#039;s original leave expires the documents are likely to be with the Home Office as part of his application for an extension. The Home Office asks that such documents be submitted not earlier than 28 days before leave expires; and the application will not normally have been decided at the time when leave expires.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>There is a further problem. Particular problems are created by Clauses 1 and 11 because a person will become an overstayer as soon as his application for an extension is refused; at which point he will cease to be allowed to work and his employers will be at risk of a civil penalty and/or a prosecution.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>On Amendment No. 38, the Minister said in the other place:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;I confirm that guidance will be issued to employers&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>Standing Committee E, 20/10/05; col. 155.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60111-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>This suggests no objection to the broad thrust of the amendment but provides little information on what guidance will be given in the individual case and on whether that guidance will be in writing, making it possible for the employer to rely on it in future. Much more clarity is needed and this amendment gives the Government an opportunity to provide that. For these reasons we back both amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   I am sure every Member of the Committee is totally opposed to, on the one hand, employers exploiting migrant labour, and, on the other hand, people remaining here and seeking employment as a cover for remaining illegally. Nevertheless, the Bill, as drafted, seems to impose very onerous liabilities on employers. Would the Minister consider whether people employing people for very short part-time kinds of work could perhaps be exempted?
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Again, I am grateful to noble Lords for their comments. Earlier today I had the privilege of meeting representatives of the Chinese community. One of the issues we discussed was the question of employment. In a sense I have already been able to rehearse some of the points raised. My meeting was an enjoyable occasion and I shall be meeting with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC120"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC120</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the representatives again to consider the points that were raised and, it is hoped, to be able to give them appropriate reassurances.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Let me begin by setting out the purpose behind the provision. I think that noble Lords understand it, but this needs to be said. There is no question that if someone is trying to work illegally in this country, it should be dealt with. We are all in this together. It is important that the Government, employers and the nation overall should recognise that this is a problem we have to tackle in an appropriate and effective manner. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, regardless of how long a person has been working, realising whether that person is working illegally is important to ensure that we have in place a proper policy that welcomes appropriately those who contribute so much to our country in a legal and effective way. It is in that spirit that the Government have introduced this approach to working with employers.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The first thing to make clear about the previous legislation is that, in my own view, it is a sledgehammer that recognises criminality. However, it means that in all circumstances we would be saying to employers that they are behaving in a criminal fashion. I do not think that is right. There are occasions when employers might have a slipshod approach to employment issues and may not do things properly, but by no means are they behaving in a criminal manner. We should make that distinction and I believe that we do so in these clauses. The purpose here is to recognise within civil justice that we can say to someone, &quot;You have not done this properly and you should have done. You will be penalised, but we do not intend to make you a criminal&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The next thing I want to say is that we have available a draft code of practice, copies of which I have with me although it is available in the Library. I am always conscious that noble Lords who contribute to the Committee proceedings may not have had an opportunity to see what we have produced. I shall be happy to pass round these copies either now or at the close of our deliberations if Members find the document helpful. It is an important draft document and we are consulting closely with employers on all these issues.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The main question underlying Amendment No. 36 is that we want to be as clear as we can with employers about what they are required to do. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has told us that he had to purchase a quite expensive and very thick book. He is absolutely right to say that we do not in any way expect employers to be familiar with the detail set out in such a book. I have not read it all, although I am sure that the noble Lord probably has done so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   I hope that the Minister will be able to supply copies of the book to all Members of the Committee so that we may be better informed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   That is a good idea.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The implication of that is that I have any control whatever over the Home <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC121"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC121</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Office budget. However, I shall feed in that request because I understand the reasons behind it. I recognise fully that noble Lords opposite carry out much of their work without the benefit of being paid to do so and I pay full tribute to that. I acknowledge also that their work includes the purchase of materials.
</p>

<a name="60111-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I am keen to ensure that employers know exactly what we are asking them to do. If they then do not do it, it will be plain that it is because their practices are not as good as they should be. It should not be because we have not made it clear what we are asking for. Our policy should be straightforward, easy to comply with and simple to understand. We do not expect employers to become experts in forged documents; that would be ridiculous and completely inappropriate.

</p>

<a name="60111-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I would be very interested in Committee Members&#039; views on the draft code of practice, which we have sought to make simple. My argument against the amendment is that it in fact asks employers to take reasonable steps in order to take reasonable steps. We believe that through the code of practice we will provide enough detail to enable employers to comply easily without the bureaucracy that the noble Lord rightly raises as an issue, and without any sense of uncertainty, which would be equally damaging. We shall be working with employers to ensure that we can effectively fulfil our ambition in that respect.

</p>

<a name="60111-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I have talked about criminality. There may even be circumstances where an employer knew that a person did not have the right permission to work but where, we believe, a civil penalty would be a better way of disposing of the issue. The Clause 21 offence is meant to deal with the most serious cases&#151;those involving the deliberate trade in and use of illegal workers. We hope that with the civil and criminal offences we have described, we can capture and recognise the particular circumstances of employers and deal with them effectively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   Before the Minister leaves the question of penalty, will she say whether the Secretary of State will be under an obligation to ensure that the amount of the penalty is proportionate? I see nothing in the Bill to impose such a duty on him. Will she give an undertaking that there will be a binding obligation on the Secretary of State, enforceable in law, to ensure that penalties are proportionate? I know that there is an appeals system and that the county court would be able to review these matters later, but my concern is that the poor old employer might become enmeshed in the need to appeal without a core obligation on the Secretary of State to impose proportionate penalties. It would be a misfortune if the employer had to appeal and persuade a county court judge that the penalty was disproportionate. That is an important question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60111-44_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Implicit in the code is exactly that expectation of the Secretary of State. The noble Lord will have a copy of the code in his hand. If he turns to page 5, he will see the framework for issuing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC122</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

penalties. It shows that the amount can be varied up to the maximum &#163;2,000. The code also outlines the kinds of circumstances and issues that might arise, not least when employers put their hands up and say, &quot;We&#039;ve got this wrong. We didn&#039;t do it properly, but we&#039;re co-operating&quot;. It is right and proper that there should be the ability to vary. Reasonableness is important; it is implicit in the code. Perhaps the noble Lord will get back to me if, having looked at the code, he is still not satisfied. I can also refer him to the ground for objection under Clause 16(1)(c) and the ground for appeal under Clause 17(1)(c).

<a name="60111-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I know about that, but is the appropriate information in the code of practice?
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60111-45_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am told that it is implicit in the code. If the noble Lord cannot find the information, I will be happy to ensure that it is made available in a way with which he is entirely satisfied. Although I may seem slightly frivolous in smiling at the noble Lord, I accept that the point is very important. I am sure that the noble Viscount will also be keen to see that we have covered the point. We want to ensure that the penalty will be proportionate. There will be a maximum figure and, if appropriate, the penalty could be zero, &#163;50, &#163;100 or whatever. That will enable the nature of the business to be recognised. All those questions will be covered.
</p>

<a name="60111-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>As we are going to ask people to look at the documentation, we think that it is right that there should be a penalty to ensure that people comply. The vast majority of employers will do that well and will already be working with people who are coming from overseas. However, we do not have 100 per cent coverage of good employers, if I may put it as simply as that.

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>On Amendment No. 37, I have a lot of sympathy with the idea of a yellow card. Again, the draft code of practice is set out in a way that allows a graded and lenient approach to first-time transgressors under the civil penalty arrangements&#151;for example, those who have carried out only partial checks on employers and are being co-operative. I do not want to turn that into, &quot;You get off the first time&quot;, because that would change the nature of our conversation with business. We recognise that people who are deliberately not doing what they should be doing should do so, but employers who do not have the right procedures in place, make mistakes and so on can also be recognised. That goes a long way to addressing the concerns raised by the CBI when I looked at the principle behind what is sought with the yellow card.

<a name="60111-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>I shall deal as well with the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about someone whose passport is at the Home Office&#151;the 28-day point. It is right that we have to ensure that the employer is able to get hold of the appropriate person. That has led to a review of the way in which the IND helpline will work, because it is obviously important that verification can take place as quickly as possible. It is a point well made and well taken. Those who apply in time for further leave <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60111-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>I turn to the point raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, about the position of children. All the issues to do with how children are employed come under the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act 1920 and, for example, the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. He will know that there are strict controls on what children can do. I understand that the legislative framework around children is suitably covered. He raises an important point about children and I shall come back to him if we feel that, having reflected on it, we need to do anything to ensure that they are captured appropriately.
</p>

<a name="60111-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The noble Viscount was worried; he thought that we had only 12 staff. Let me reassure him immediately that those 12 staff will handle litigation and objections, but there will be 1,200 enforcement officers capable of dealing with these matters. To put it in context again&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is very keen for me to provide statistics, so when I have a figure I shall give it to him if I can. In 2004, some 1,600 successful operations were carried out that resulted in over 3,000 illegal workers being arrested. That demonstrates that there is an issue which we need to address effectively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60111-45_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for that information. She says that during the most recent calendar year some 3,000 illegal workers were arrested, but what was the result of those arrests? How many of those people were prosecuted and how many convicted? Were they removed from the country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="60111-45_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I cannot say that offhand. I shall see what information we have.

<a name="60111-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I am always a bit apprehensive of getting a filthy look when I am taxing the Minister&#039;s patience, but I have looked at the draft code and am sorry to say that what we are talking about is not there. I am sure she agrees that nothing in the Bill says that the penalty must be proportionate. The only way in which it is dealt with is by saying that you can appeal&#151;you can make an objection that it is too high and make an appeal. That gets you into the toils of the system and is fine. But when you go back to the code, the governing guidance to immigration officers and the Minister, page 5&#151;the framework&#151;gives what I can only regard as characteristic Home Office rubbery and elusive language. It does not say anything about an overriding obligation not to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut&#151;not to be disproportionate. The framework states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;The reductions provide guidelines to Immigration Officers and are indicative only&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>whatever that means. It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;Immigration Officers retain discretion to adjust the amount of penalty according to the facts of each individual case. Where an objection is made to the Secretary of State, this framework will be considered, but the amount of penalty will be finally determined by issues raised and evidence provided&quot;.</p>

<a name="60111-45_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   The Minister was good enough to give the figures of 1,600 operations and 3,000 illegal immigrants. I would like to pose a different question to that put by my noble friend Lord Avebury. How many employers were prosecuted?
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60111-45_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   That is a very interesting point. I do not have the answer at my fingertips, but I will let the noble Lord have that information as soon as I have it. I hope that I have satisfied the noble Lord, Lord Lester, completely by saying that I will put it into the code.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60111-45_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I am very grateful indeed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60111-45_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   Will we get a draft code so that we will be able to see other points of this kind where we can get helpful dialogue?
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="60111-45_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The draft code is available to the noble Lord because that is the document which we hope to turn into a succinct and clear final version. I am always keen to make sure that anything employers receive is as short as possible. There will be other issues and amendments to be made to it. I undertake to make sure that the next draft of the code, including proportionality within it, is available to the Committee as soon as I have sight of it. I was not sure whether the noble Lord was implying that I would have a very thick document. I hope not&#151;for all the reasons indicated by the noble Viscount on making sure that employers are provided with useful, to the point and succinct documents. The answer to the question on convictions put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is that there were 17 convictions between 1997 and 2004 under Section 8 of the 1996 Act. I have already indicated that one of the issues of that Act is that it is weighty legislation. I hope that we now have a much broader and more flexible way of approaching those issues.
</p>

<a name="60111-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>If Members of the Committee are willing, I shall turn to Amendment No. 38. I completely understand the objectives behind the amendment. I confirm that we will issue guidance to employers, but we do not think that the amendment is necessary. The penalty notice will set out why the Secretary of State thinks that the employer is liable to a civil penalty, so that there is absolute clarity about the obligations that are needed to prevent illegal working that the Secretary of State thinks they have failed to meet.
</p>

<a name="60111-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Part of the enforcement officers&#039; responsibility will be to offer information and guidance to employers on illegal working legislation when they undertake visits. The draft code will direct immigration officers to do just that each time they serve a caution or a penalty. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC125"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC125</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We will also have comprehensive guidance for employers, the Home Office website and a helpline service. We do not think it necessary to include all of that in the penalty notice, but we think we have a robust system that will give employers the information to enable them to make sure that they are compliant in the future and that we have provided the necessary links to make that happen in a simple and easy manner, which, again, I appreciate is part of what the noble Viscount seeks to achieve.
</p>

<a name="60111-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Amendment No. 39 applies to the issue of employers having to continuously or continually look at the status of people working for them. As my honourable friend Mr McNulty said in another place, our current ambition is that about every 12 months employers will consider the status of those people who do not have indefinite leave to remain or who may have temporary status. I was asked this morning how that would operate. We want to work with employers to see what works best for them. In some industries, it might be that it would be more effective if on a specific day everyone brought their documents in&#151;for example, 1 April&#151;because that would suit those employers. Others may choose to do it differently. But we do not suggest that employers are required to look more often than that. Even if an employer takes on someone who has the ability to work for six months, we do not expect the employer to remember and go back after six months saying, &quot;Hang on, where are you in this?&quot;. Much as I might like that, I recognise that for many employers it might be quite impracticable.


</p>

<a name="60111-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>We acknowledge that this will not be done once in a lifetime, but on a basis that we think is reasonable, about once a year. Employees who have the status will have their documents looked at. On that basis, we do not think that we are putting an unnecessary burden on employers. How employers go about this is for them; they may do things differently for their own reasons. It may be that there is an obvious method, but we say that a check made around once a year would be appropriate. That is how this provision will be taken forward and we will pursue our discussions on that basis.
</p>

<a name="60111-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I hope that I have been able to address the concerns expressed by giving an assurance that we will have a simple process; that employers will know precisely what we are asking them to do; that we will work with them to support them, using the officers concerned to give advice, information and support; that we recognise that mistakes can be made; that we have in mind the necessary flexibility and proportionality to ensure that this civil process will work effectively; that we will ask employers to look again at the information, but on a basis that is proportionate, reasonable and not burdensome; and that with employers as our colleagues we will be able to address the particular concern we all share&#151;that of ensuring that we do not have illegal working this country. On that basis, I hope the noble Viscount will feel that I have responded to his concerns.

(   )   the amount of the penalty would threaten the future viability of the employer&#039;s business&quot;

<p><a name="st_89"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 40 I shall deal with the probing amendments in this group that address Clauses 16 and 17; namely, the process of objection and appeal with regard to the civil penalties we have just discussed in relation to Clause 15.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The civil penalties under Clause 15 will impose huge burdens on businesses, particularly small and medium sized enterprises. The CBI and ILPA have argued that they cannot and should not be the watchdogs for the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. The Minister has admitted that there is a likelihood that mistakes may be made. Does she not agree that the imposition of a penalty on businesses&#151;although I noted her sympathetic remarks about the yellow card scheme&#151;could potentially threaten the viability of those businesses? We have tabled Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 to ensure that a timetable is set out for payment after consultation with the employer in Clause 16(5), and that it is one which will take into account the viability of the employer&#039;s business in Clause 16(1). Similarly, Amendment No. 45 to Clause 17(2) would allow a timetable to be set up for the payment of the penalty, should an appeal be allowed.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The Minister in another place expressed sympathy for the amendments and their sentiments, and he stated that HMG can and will consider whether it is appropriate in some cases for an employer who has been served with a penalty to pay in instalments over a certain period. Can the Minister clarify how and in what circumstances the Government will do this? Who will consider whether it is appropriate and what criteria will they use? Is it possible to see a copy of those criteria?
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Amendment No. 42 would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to increase the penalty once he has considered an objection to one he has already served. I argue that it is hard to justify what seems to be an additional penalty on what could be a legitimate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC127"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC127</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

objection when the employer will have to pay the original fine should that objection not be upheld. Enforcing the letter of the law, as suggested by the Minister in Standing Committee in another place at col. 161 on 20 October, does not mean that the fine needs to be increased just because you disagree with the objection.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Amendment No. 43 aims to ensure that the Secretary of State must give reasons to an objecting employer for why the appeal has been declined. Surely this is a reasonable request, particularly as we are continually being reassured that there will be clear procedures in the code of practice and guidelines under which the Secretary of State can assess the objection and give his response. This will promote the transparency, good governance and accountability that the Government are keen to implement both here and internationally.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>While these are probing amendments, I do not doubt that the Minister will refer us to guidance that the Government intend to produce on this matter. The problem is that, as I understand it, the guidance will not be produced until after a detailed public consultation on the proposed requirements to be placed on employers after the Bill has received Royal Assent. So we cannot see a draft of the government proposals and we have no guarantee that they will in fact take account of the concerns expressed in our probing amendments. Increasingly the Government are asking us to rubber stamp skeleton, or as they call it, enabling legislation the details of which we have little control over. The same argument applies to the costs that the final point may incur. As ever, the devil is in the detail. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="60111-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   Am I right in thinking that the draft code just circulated by the noble Baroness is applicable to the clause we are now discussing? If it is, parts of it may assuage some of the anxieties just expressed by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman. I am thinking in particular of paragraph 8 on page 9, where the employer does have a right of objection because the level of the penalty is too high. The Secretary of State is obliged to consider evidence provided of the employer&#039;s financial circumstances in determining the objection. If that means that the fine imposed should not be such as to jeopardise the continuing existence of the business, perhaps it will achieve a part of what the noble Viscount seeks in some of his amendments. I hope that the noble Baroness can assure us that what is set out in the code will apply to the interpretation of Clause 16.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="60111-46_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Perhaps I may pick up that point because it might save a little time. The code is applicable at the point of imposition, of objection and of appeal, so it would be relevant. I am nervous of handing around documents in the middle of a debate, but in this case the noble Lord, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC128</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Avebury, has been extremely helpful in pointing this out. It is an important element which I shall deal with in my response.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="60111-46_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   When I first saw that this is described as a civil penalty, my suspicious mind caused me to wonder whether that was in order to erode due process in any way. But having studied the Bill carefully, I think that on the contrary the requirements of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, for example, are fully met.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>In the first place, I understand that the burden is upon the state to show that the penalty is justified, as provided in Clause 15. The burden is not on the employer; rather it is on the state. Secondly, the notice gives a fair warning of what is involved in Clause 15. Thirdly, the notice of objection is perfectly reasonable. Fourthly, when one comes to the appeal, it is not restricted in an unfair way because the employer can argue either that he is not liable and may therefore be excused or that the level of the penalty is too high. Lastly, Clause 17(3) is very welcome because it states that the appeal is to be a re-hearing, not just an appeal in the formal sense, but a re-hearing of the Secretary of State&#039;s decision to impose the penalty. In those circumstances, we have full natural justice embodied in the Bill and therefore I do not think that, in terms of due process, the scheme is objectionable&#151;provided that the code of practice itself emphasises fairness and proportionality.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60111-46_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   This group of amendments includes Amendment No. 43, which we support. The Government talk of a &quot;fairer, faster, firmer&quot; system for immigration. To avoid any delay, it seems that it is right to look briefly at the purpose of this amendment. It would make explicit in the statute that written reasons for a decision on a notice of objection. We see no reason why that could not be done.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>An employer can submit a notice of objection to a penalty. Under Clause 16(5)(b) the Secretary of State must inform the employer of the decision on the notice of objection and if the employer is not satisfied with it, he is likely to proceed to an appeal in accordance with the provisions set out in Clause 17. The employer will have set out his case in the notice of objection. To narrow and best define the issues at appeal, and in appropriate cases to avoid the employer going to appeal altogether, it is sensible that the Secretary of State should set out his case in the decision on the notice of objection. Therefore the amendment appears wholly unobjectionable. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60111-46_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am extraordinarily grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, for his comments, particularly on the way these provisions fit not only with European human rights legislation but also, as he pointed out, with natural justice. I am glad that he pointed that out to the Committee because it is important. The noble Viscount has rightly raised issues on which I suspect he seeks absolute clarity and reassurance on the way we will approach this. I hope that I shall be able to provide that clarity and reassurance in the appropriate manner.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC129"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC129</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60111-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I agree with the noble Viscount that we are concerned that an employer should not be driven out of business for making an honest mistake in checking an employee&#039;s entitlement to work. It is implicit in this part of the Bill that the Secretary of State can consider the impact of a penalty on the business if it forms part of the employer&#039;s objections, which surely it would. Furthermore, Clauses 16 and 17 provide that an employer may object at appeal on the grounds that the penalty is too high. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was kind enough to point out, the draft code of practice specifies that the Secretary of State must consider evidence provided of an employer&#039;s financial means in determining the objection. We believe that that is the appropriate way to deal with an important issue, one that we recognise and have sought to address fully. I hope that when the noble Viscount comes to reflect on the position, he will feel that we have achieved what is set out in his amendment.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I turn to the question of the timetable. Again we want to achieve this through administrative practice rather than through legislative provision. This should be more a dialogue between representatives of the Secretary of State and the recipients rather than a process taken through the courts. The court is the final recourse, and as the Minister responsible for mediation I am keen to resolve these matters away from the court. In appropriate circumstances, we have made it clear that we would enable payments to be made over a period of 12 months. That recognises the financial issues that would form part of the case. However, we are always mindful of ensuring that the deterrent effect we want to see is in place.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>I also understand the point about the Secretary of State being able to raise the level of a fine if it were appropriate to do so. I want to make it absolutely clear that that would not be done just because someone disputed the fine. They should not feel that such an objection would have any bearing on an increase in the penalty. We have modelled much of this provision on the scheme provided for road hauliers, which seems to be working extremely well. Only seven appeals have been brought forward out of 1,000 cases. That is a very low proportion. We want to retain the provision so that if the circumstances warranted it, the Secretary of State could say that the penalty was too lenient. But the decision would be made only on that basis; it would not be linked in any way to someone bringing forward an objection.
</p>

<a name="60111-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I can also confirm that we already intend to ensure that the Secretary of State&#039;s decision on an employer&#039;s objection would be given to the employer in question, along with the reason. However, again we do not feel that it is necessary to make it a legal requirement because it is a part of what we are proposing to do.

</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60111-47_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden </b>   moved Amendment No. 46:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>Page 10, line 11, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   The factors to be considered by the Secretary of State shall include the extent to which the employer has afforded the migrant worker treatment not less favourable than that which applies to national workers, by virtue of legislative or administrative provisions, collective labour agreement or custom, in respect of payment of earnings, deductions from earnings for the purposes of taxation and national insurance contributions, and the right to join, and organise in the workplace as part of, a trade union.&quot;

<p><a name="st_99"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 46 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 75 in the same group. When I spoke at Second Reading, I said that I wanted to concentrate on the employment issues in the Bill, and that is what this amendment is all about. It is fairly common knowledge that many migrant workers are exploited by unscrupulous employers, and I know that the Government are attempting to deal with this by imposing penalties on employers using illegal workers. We discussed the point earlier today. However, this approach may not have entirely the desired effect. My amendment seeks to set out the employment rights to which a migrant worker is entitled: the minimum wage, any provisions in collective agreements and the right to join a trade union; in other words, the right not to be treated as cheap labour.
</p>

<a name="60111-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Incidentally, I also believe that there should be a system whereby an illegal worker can become a legal and documented worker. That does not form part of the amendment but can perhaps be discussed somewhere else in the context of the Bill. I have received a letter from my noble friend at the Dispatch Box, for which I thank her, in which she has told me that this issue is not on the Government&#039;s agenda at the moment. She referred to the experience of other countries in running such programmes, which has not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC131"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC131</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been entirely favourable. On the other hand, it would be a good idea if the Government were to pay more attention to the whole matter.
</p>

<a name="60111-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>The use of migrant workers as cheap labour is unacceptable for a number of reasons. I was rather angered when I heard the chief executive of the CBI welcoming immigration on the ground that it dealt with what he referred to as &quot;wage inflation&quot;; in other words, desperate people willing to work hard for low pay to keep the level of wages down.


</p>

<a name="60111-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>It hardly needs saying that that kind of approach does little for race relations, although I am glad to say that most trade unions have decided that the answer is to recruit migrant workers and actively seek to improve their wages and conditions.
</p>

<a name="60111-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>My amendment therefore includes a reference to the right to join and organise in the workplace. I hope that that will be acceptable to the Government. I know that there is concern about the possibility of vulnerable people being exploited. There was an immediate outcry over the tragedy at Morecambe Bay. The Government took immediate action and supported the Private Member&#039;s Bill about gangmasters, which I am very glad is now on the statute book. I therefore hope that there will be a sympathetic response from the Government to my amendment. If accepted, it is likely to ensure that exploitive employers deliberately defrauding the system face higher fines and bigger penalties. We have to ensure that rights in relation to not being regarded as cheap labour should be included in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60111-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Amendment No. 75 deals with the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which came into effect on 1 July 2003. It has since been ratified by 33 states, but not so far by EU member states, despite some pressure from the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee. This issue was considered recently by the House of Lords committee on economic migration to the EU. The Government apparently feel that ratification would undermine the UK&#039;s system of frontier controls and is also likely to cost too much because of extending access to public funds and services to migrant workers and their families on a non-discriminatory basis as compared with British citizens. The committee, however, did not find those arguments convincing and has recommended research into the likely costs. It also thinks that the Government should seek to develop a political consensus towards the convention, both within the UK and across the EU.
</p>

<a name="60111-47_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The UK is already a party to ILO Convention No. 97 concerning migration for employment, which covers important rights for migrant workers in remuneration, trade union membership and social security. In the circumstances, therefore, there seems little reason to oppose the UN convention and a case for trying to ensure its application on an EU-wide basis. It could be that our new equality law, proposed by the Government, may cover those issues, although the problem may then be that the onus will be put on individual workers to take action to secure their rights. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC132"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC132</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Many migrant workers will be too scared or too vulnerable to take such action. I await with interest the Minister&#039;s response. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="60111-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I shall make two points. First, I have raised the issue about the convention on the legal status for migrant workers in the past. Having carefully studied the convention, I strongly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, that it gives necessary protection to one of the most vulnerable groups that lack protection in international law unless this convention is in force. I very much regret that it has not been ratified by the United Kingdom and I hope the Minister will spend the coming weekend reading the convention again so that she can reflect on the reasons why it is a great step forward.
</p>

<a name="60111-47_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Secondly, I want to apologise to the Grand Committee for having made an elementary mistake. It is always enjoyable when a senior QC grovels, which I am about to do. I am out of order in making the apology, but I hope that I may do so for your pleasure. When we were dealing with the points made by the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, I gave a clean bill of health on due process, but I forgot that there is a reverse burden of proof in respect of the excuse, the defence of the employer. I was wrong about that. It is dealt with by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in paragraph 2.30. Therefore, when we come back to this, perhaps I may suggest that we look again at that unfairness because it needs to be rectified. I apologise for being both out of order and for having made that stupid mistake.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60111-47_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I warmly welcome the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. I particularly endorse her remarks about the Select Committee&#039;s report on economic migration to the EU, which was submitted in early December, although the Government have not yet replied to it&#151;I make no complaint about that, as the Government are still within the normal timescale for doing so. However, I was somewhat disturbed by what the noble Baroness said about the Government&#039;s reluctance to sign the convention on the rights of migrant workers. As far as I understood her, she said that she had received a letter from the Government saying that that was not at present on their agenda.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="60111-47_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   Perhaps I could clarify that. I had sought a system of regularisation to enable illegal workers to become legal. The noble Baroness replied to me on behalf of the Government to say that that was not on the agenda for the moment. Having looked at the experience of other countries, the Government had found that the situation was not what they regarded as favourable and so were not proceeding on the matter. However, I still think that it should be considered.
</p>

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   The noble Baroness did not say that the Government had set their face against the United Nations convention on the rights of migrant workers, so we may still hope that, in response to the many representations that have been made, not least by the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column GC133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble Baroness&#151;as well as by the Select Committee and many others&#151;the UK will take the lead. I wish that the UK had done so during its presidency of the EU, because, as we heard, no other EU member state has yet signed up to the convention. If the UK had done so during its presidency, it would surely have given a tremendous impetus to the process.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The Select Committee heard that many of the conditions under the convention are already satisfied by the Government&#039;s existing obligations, including ILO convention No. 97, as the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, mentioned. If we are simply talking about small financial penalties that the Government might incur by signing up, I would hope that that obstacle can readily be overcome. It surely cannot be more important for the Treasury to save a little money than for us to enter into a most essential obligation to protect the rights of the most vulnerable section of our community. I sincerely hope that the Minister will give us some encouragement this afternoon, even if she is not yet in a position to say what the Government will do in response to the Select Committee&#039;s report.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   Does the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, agree that we are in fact talking about a Council of Europe convention rather than a United Nations convention?
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   We are talking about the United Nations convention on the protection of migrant workers. However, as the noble Lord rightly points out, there is also the 1977 Council of Europe convention on migrant workers which the United Kingdom has not signed either. The Select Committee recommended that the Government should accede to the Council of Europe convention, as the noble Lord suggests, but that is not to say that we should not do both.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to noble Lords for this important debate. My noble friend Lady Turner has sat through all our deliberations today and now, towards the end, she has raised an underlying principle. At the forefront of her mind is, as ever, her concern that we should protect and support our workers appropriately. I pay enormous tribute to her work in this area over many years. I was fortunate enough to be a member of the trade union that my noble friend was engaged with, so I can speak of it with first-hand experience as well.
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="60111-48_time0"></a><h5>7.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60111-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I hope that noble Lords will understand my concern not to allow employers mitigation because they have treated illegal workers well. An illegal worker is an illegal worker; in my mind it is a straight line. It would be inappropriate for employers to argue that because they were nice to their workers they have behaved better. It may be in our minds to consider that they have tried to treat them effectively but I do not want that to get mixed up with other factors. The reason is that the appropriate and proper treatment of people who come to our country and provide us with their <br>&nbsp;<br>

skills and expertise, enrich our daily lives and improve our economic growth and sustainability should in all circumstances be valued and recognised.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I know that my noble friend is using this part of the Bill as a device to raise an important issue, but I hope she will understand that I do not agree with the amendments because I do not want to distort the fact that an illegal worker is an illegal worker or to take away from the critical need to support legal workers in this country appropriately. The Government are looking at how best the public authorities responsible for enforcing workplace regulations can work together&#151;IND, the Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC, DTI, the Health and Safety Executive and so on&#151;to make improvements. For example, our pilot scheme in the West Midlands tests our departments&#039; ability to share intelligence on the suspected exploitation of illegal workers within the existing legal powers and establish how we work better together to support workers in all situations. That could be an important part of the work of the new Equality and Human Rights Commission that we are setting up. I acknowledge the role of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, in ensuring that we gave it flexibility of approach. The commission could be valuable in giving us information and looking into those issues. I cannot agree to my noble friend&#039;s amendment for the reasons I have given, but I accept absolutely that we must do as much as possible to support the position of legal workers in this country and to ensure that they get appropriate terms and conditions.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers was established in 1977. No one has ratified it and I do not think that there is any prospect that the Government will do so. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, suggested that I might spend my weekend looking at the convention. I return from a meeting of justices Ministers in Vienna on Saturday evening, so I think that the noble Lord will find that he is having lunch in my house on Sunday. If he wishes me to cook, I suggest that he withdraws the proposal that I look at the convention.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   Leaving aside domestic matters, I was actually thinking of the UN convention, which is now much more important and topical. I do not want to spoil either the noble Baroness&#039;s digestion or her domestic arrangements.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   Or, indeed, the noble Lord&#039;s digestion. The information that I have is about the European convention, as that was set out in the amendment. I cannot speak with any authority on the UN convention. As ever, I will look at it and come back to the Committee on those questions.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>We seek in our domestic legislation to support legal workers who come to this country appropriately and effectively. I do not believe that we will look to sign the convention as it stands because some of the issues in it are perhaps in a different place from where the UK Government are and previous governments have been. I would not want to pretend to my noble friend or the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that it is likely that we will <br>&nbsp;<br>

ratify it. That does not diminish our desire to deal appropriately with the issues raised in the amendment. I know that that response will disappoint my noble friend but the Government are committed to working with her and with the organisations and departments I have mentioned to ensure that our legal workforce is looked after appropriately and its valuable contribution recognised.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   Perhaps I may try to clear up some of the confusion I caused by saying that I would speak to Amendment No. 47. As I understand it, my amendment should be met effectively by the government amendments in the next group. If that is so, I do not intend to speak to it with this group and am happy to leave it for another occasion. If we have guarantees behind the scenes that our amendment is covered, we will be able to withdraw it before Report.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60111-48_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  The final stages of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 were implemented on 30 December 2005. This date saw the commencement of the core provisions for local authorities by the Department for Education and Skills and the National Assembly for Wales and rules of court from my department that underpin the new provisions. Subsection 1(a) of Section 122 provides for representation of children within placement proceedings and rules made to come into force on 30 December 2005.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>Subsection 1(b) and subsection (2) provide rule-making powers for the separate representation of children in Children Act cases generally and in particular in section 8 cases. Both provisions were commenced on 7 December 2004. To inform our consideration of what rules of court might be made, my department commissioned research by Cardiff University. We wanted to understand whether formal representation through a solicitor and guardian is meeting children&#039;s needs, or whether there are other ways in which their needs can be met. It also met our commitment to consult with children on this issue.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The Cardiff University research with children and families focused on their views on how they were heard/how involved when children were separately represented under the existing Rule 9.5 of the Family Proceedings Rules 1991. We have now received the first draft of that research which I hope to publish next month.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The views of children themselves were not conclusive due to the small sample size, but when added to other evidence the research does not indicate that separate representation would be right for all children in all cases. New rules of court will be developed in the light of this research evidence and CAFCASS&#039;s important proposals in <i>Every Day Matters</i>.
</p>

<a name="60111-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>Existing provisions for the representation of children remain unaffected and offer a range of ways in which a court making decisions about them may hear children&#039;s wishes and feelings. In the first year after the issue of the Rule 9.5 practice direction by the president of the Family Division in April 2004, CAFCASS figures indicate that courts made more than double the number of Rule 9.5 appointments by comparison with the previous year. An updated analysis of figures at the end of the current financial year will provide further information about the extent <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS12"></a>

<b>11 Jan 2006 : Column WS12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the courts&#039; use of CAFCASS officers to undertake Rule 9.5 work on behalf of children. The increased use of Rule 9.5 appointments following the issue of the practice direction appears to have refocused issues on the child at an earlier stage in the proceedings, alongside consideration of the protracted concerns of the parents.

<a name="60111-49_head0"></a><h3 align=center>List 99</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="60111-49_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60111-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The protection of children is a top priority for this Government. The case which has come to public attention this week raises very serious issues. I take full responsibility for all decisions taken in the department on whether individuals should be placed on List 99, the list covering those barred from working in schools. The List 99 barring scheme is a process that has operated for decades. In a number of specified serious offences an individual will automatically be included on List 99. Initial inquiries indicate that there have been a small number of cases where, on the basis of advice, in accordance with the process that has been in operation for many years, Ministers have made the decision not to include on List 99 an individual who is on the sex offenders register.
</p>

<a name="60111-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>It is of the utmost importance that the House and wider public are not misled by any information put into the public domain. I have therefore decided to commission as a matter of urgency an exhaustive review of all such cases since the introduction of the sex offenders register in 1997&#151;a register which provides an additional safeguard for prospective employers. I    will also review the decision-making process surrounding such cases and any immediate policy implications. For example, I will consider:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>How the closest possible alignment can be secured between List 99, the sex offenders register and other data sources.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>The role of Ministers in the decision-making process

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>How police advice can be more fully considered prior to decisions being made.

</p>
</ul>
<a name="60111-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>I will make a further Statement to the House shortly. The Government are already committed to implementing Sir Michael Bichard&#039;s recommendations to tighten the system for vetting and barring those who wish to work with children and vulnerable adults and to bringing forward legislation in this Session of Parliament. In the mean time, with immediate effect, I will personally consider any cases of individuals on the sex offenders register where a ministerial decision is required as to whether they should be placed on List 99.

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="60111w01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   When assessing an individual asylum claim we will take account of country information relevant to that claim. This would include information, if available, on the treatment of returned failed asylum seekers. Where we refuse a claim and the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal dismisses any appeal we therefore consider that it is safe for that individual to return. This is one of the reasons why the Home Office does not routinely monitor the treatment of individuals once removed from the UK. Another reason is that in some countries such monitoring could of itself place returnees at risk when otherwise they would not be. In addition, we cannot require such individuals to keep in touch with us. Therefore, we would consider some form of systematic monitoring only if particular circumstances made it appropriate for a given country. However, where specific allegations are made that any returnee, to any country, has experienced ill-treatment on return from the UK, these are followed up through the FCO and the relevant British Embassy as a matter of urgency.

the person on the grounds that their deportation from the UK would be conducive to the public good. The number of deportations, compared with the total number of removals, is small, and the number where we may feel it necessary to seek assurances is likely to be very small indeed. The purpose of the assurances in those particular cases is to enable the UK to satisfy itself that removal will be consistent with our international obligations.

If they wish, a local authority may specify in a remedial notice how such works might be phased. A sample form of words is included in the appendix to the guidance document <i>High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure</i>. Alternatively, a local authority might encourage the hedge owner to discuss and agree with them a suitable timetable for the phasing of the works.

<a name="60111w03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>Under the 2003 Act, if an owner fails to reduce a hedge to its final cutting height within the overall period set by a local authority, they commit an offence and could face prosecution and/or the authority could carry out the necessary works themselves and reclaim the costs from the hedge owner. No offence is committed if the hedge owner fails to carry out the cutting according to the phases set out in a remedial notice or agreed separately with a local authority. There is no means, therefore, of enforcing the timing of individual stages of phased reduction. It is, however, open to a local authority to send warning letters if a stage has passed without action being taken.

<a name="60111w03_spmin3"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  The Home Office-led evaluation of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on levels of crime and disorder will use a range of measures at both a national and local level. These include national crime surveys of victims and offenders supplemented with case studies involving five towns and cities in England. These local case studies, one of which is Croydon which is within the Metropolitan Police force area, will look at patterns of police recorded crime and disorder in relation to licensed premises and extended hours. Recorded crime data have been requested on the following crime types: violence against the person; sexual offences; and disorder and criminal damage. This work will also include, within the case study areas, surveys of local residents and interviews with the responsible authorities which have been designated under the Act as well as with local night-time economy businesses including licensees. Furthermore, the evaluation will also, where possible, draw upon data which details the number of patient attendances at accident and emergency and the number of calls for assistance from the ambulance service for each of the case study areas. The Home Office plans to publish the findings from the evaluation and once it has done so the report will be placed in the Library. In addition, the Home Office is conducting a monitoring exercise, which aims to provide a quicker and more limited assessment of the Act than the evaluation which is detailed above. Police forces have been asked to supply, on a voluntary basis, monthly returns on violent crime and criminal damage broken down by the hour of offences. If the findings are published then the report will be placed in the Library.

The police funding formula uses a range of socio-demographic factors to reasonably reflect the relative needs of each authority. Grant allocations also take into account a police authority&#039;s ability to raise revenue via the police precept.

The Chinooks provided an important heavy lift capacity for the period of their deployment and their work was praised by the United Nations and other humanitarian operations.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a>However, at the request of the United Nations, DfID agreed to take on contracts for four Mi8 helicopters for four months as replacements for the Chinooks, as they would be more adaptable to the changing weather conditions at the time and through the winter. This formed part of a package of further support to the United Nations helicopter operation of &#163;5.5 million. DfID has also provided support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which includes provision of helicopters and through the Ministry of Defence funded the delivery of two Puma helicopters from Spain for the use by the ICRC.
