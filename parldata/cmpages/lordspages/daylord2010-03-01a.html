In January 2010, 1,635,600 people were claiming jobseeker's allowance.</p>

Does he agree that those figures and the 23,500 rise in the number of claimants hardly suggest that we are well clear of the recession and in fact augur rather badly for economic growth and the Government's target of 1.25 per cent for this year, which is twice the EU forecast of 0.6 per cent?</p>

There are now clear signs that the position in the labour market is stabilising-redundancies have fallen back significantly since spring of last year, fewer people made new claims for jobseeker's allowance and the number of vacancies is also increasing. Indeed the number of people unemployed on the ILO definition is now close to flat and has, as the noble Lord identified, reduced a little. Although the claimant count rose in January, and there will always be variations from month to month, the number of people making a new claim-322,600-was the lowest figure for a year. There are still challenges ahead, which is why we must not hold back from the investment that the Government have put into a range of programmes. In particular, we must not divert resources from these programmes to inheritance tax cuts for the wealthy or, indeed, for the married couple's allowance.</p>

Before the recession we had the aspiration of an 80 per cent employment rate. As we have come through the recession, we have seen the first quarter of growth, at the end of last year, in a little while. We need to re-energise and refocus on making sure that we hit those employment targets, which is why I repeat that these things do not happen by chance; they happen because the Government have invested £5 billion in capacity for Jobcentre Plus for a range of measures to keep people in employment or to move them closer to the labour market.</p>

Can we also bear in mind that a 0.3 per cent growth rate is higher than even the best prediction, which was 0.2 per cent? Should we not be at least a little welcoming of the optimism that feeds and drives the British industry that keeps the jobs and investment going?</p>

It is not just the growth rate at the end of last quarter: a number of surveys are showing improved confidence. He is right that if you look at the UK's unemployment rate in comparison with the rest of the world, we have an unemployment rate that is lower than the G7, EU and OECD averages. We are at 7.8 per cent on the ILO measure. Canada is at 8.3 per cent, Italy at 8.5 per cent, the US at 9.7 per cent, France at 10 per cent and Spain at 19.5 per cent.</p>

He also talks of investment at a time when the car scrappage scheme is ending. How many jobs does he think have been saved by the car scrappage scheme, and how many will be lost by its abandonment?</p>

I do not have the data on the precise number of jobs attached to the scheme, but he is quite right that we need to be about sustaining jobs so that people have not only employment but jobs that are sustainable and in which they can grow and flourish. If he looks at the vacancies that came out in the recent report, he will also see that manufacturing showed an increase of something like 23 per cent on the quarter. That is a good sign as well.</p>

Regulation 19 requires the caller who leaves a recorded phone message to ensure that they have obtained prior consent.

In these circumstances, consumers are encouraged to report such calls for further investigation to the Information Commissioner's Office, as it has responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations.</p>

I, too, have had these calls, although I have not stayed on the line as long as she did-I have never got to the "press 2" bit. However, we share her concern about the situation. We realise that a significant number of people are struggling with their finances during the recession. Additional funds were poured into various funding activities: £10 million to support longer opening hours at 330 citizens advice bureaux; £5.8 million for the National Debtline to increase capacity levels on the helpline by 50 per cent, thereby enabling it to handle 220,000 calls a year; and £500,000 to develop a new self-help debt advice toolkit to empower people to negotiate with creditors and agree a repayment plan, thus freeing up more time for debt advisers to deal with people who are facing crisis debt problems.</p>

That is not necessary. We also know that Sure Start centres in more advantaged areas are used by children from disadvantaged areas, and that is why it is so important that we have a universal service.</p>

The Conservative Party supports Sure Start centres but it wants to ensure that they respond to the needs of the most vulnerable and poorest families in this country. Following on from the Question of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, what has happened to the extra £79 million for outreach workers? Has it been used and are there such workers in all Sure Start centres?</p>

We on this side of the House are saying that we have to invest in Sure Start and that it is not an either/or situation. We see the benefits of investing in Sure Start come through the system, with children who are more ready for school and who display better behaviour, and parents who are more equipped to cope with the challenges of a modern society. We see these benefits coming through the system and, in time, with another Labour Government we will see a much better outcome for 16 to 19 year-olds too.</p>

My main questions centre on the interface between personal care at home and NHS continuing care.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="1003011000071"></a>The number of people currently in receipt of continuing care from the NHS is roughly 45,000. It is likely, although I confess that I have no figures to support this, that a high proportion of those people will be assessed as being in critical need of personal care   


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1195"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under the FACS-fair access to care services-definition. The FACS guidelines, which are currently the subject of revision, set out the criteria for determining a person's level of need, the four categories being "low", "moderate", "substantial" and "critical". As we know, the Bill is designed to cover only those in critical need, and then only those who require substantial help with four or more activities of daily living.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="1003011000072"></a>The Minister will know that NHS continuing care has provided a field day for lawyers over the past 10 years. A senior lawyer described it to me the other day as a sub-specialisation in the field of litigation, such are the quantity of challenges brought by patients, and also very often the families of patients, against decisions taken by the NHS about eligibility. With this Bill, we have in prospect another dimension of this type of challenge, one in which the NHS itself is likely to argue that at least some of the burden of looking after people in their own homes should be borne by local authorities. The assessment process is set to become even more fraught than it has been up to now. We can envisage local authorities resisting the idea of providing someone with free personal care at home and directing them instead towards residential accommodation with additional nursing, while at the same time the PCT will resist that idea and argue in favour of personal care in the home with little or no nursing element. Somehow, there will have to be protocols to deal with this type of situation.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="1003011000073"></a>Of course, we all, I am sure, subscribe to the idea of pooled budgets, but that will not of itself get round the potential for disputes. If we look at the draft regulations and at the list of qualifying services that are to be the basis for determining whether someone's needs are critical, we see that they include,</p>
<ul><a name="1003011000216"></a>"eating or drinking (including the administration of parenteral nutrition)".</ul>
<p><a name="1003011000196"></a>I am surprised to see the administration of parenteral nutrition classified as personal care. In hospital, parenteral nutrition is almost invariably overseen by a qualified nurse as it is classed as a form of medical treatment. Similarly, the list includes washing and bathing. It would be helpful if the Minister could say whether this means we have finally overcome the arcane distinction between an NHS bath and a social services bath. If we have, I am quite surprised, because underneath that example of what sounds like a daft distinction lies a substantive issue in terms of the degree of care and skill required to give a bath to one patient as compared to another.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="1003011000074"></a>Similarly, oral care is included as a qualifying service for personal care. Certainly, some oral care will be quite straightforward and will not require a nurse, but will this always be the case where a person has some medical complication relating to their mouth, gums or teeth? Equally, in the list of so-called activities of daily living, we find management of treatment which consists of a prescription-only medicine. I agree that a care worker is perfectly capable of reminding a frail, elderly person that it is time to take their medicine. That is not a nursing task. But things become more difficult if we imagine a confused elderly person who takes a different combination of different pills at different times of the day. The level of responsibility required in a care

This is the kind of thing which, in hospital, only a qualified nurse would do. I worry that we may be creating a potential minefield here, in terms of where responsibilities will lie, as between the NHS and local authorities. In many ways, it is helpful to define in black and white what we mean by personal care, but the other side of the coin is the scope that is created for arguing over what is meant by the various terms listed in the regulations. It is on that point, in particular, that I should be glad of any reassurance from the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="1003011000076"></a>After I tabled it last week, some individuals in my other working life, who did not know who I was and did not know that I had anything to do with your Lordships' House, happened to have a conversation which I simply sat in on and observed. They were all workers for a voluntary organisation who have had experience of assisting older people with the process of assessment for continuing care. They were trying to establish between themselves-they came from three different areas-whether there was any consistency at all in the decision-making processes to which they had been party.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="1003011000077"></a>What set my mind particularly to this matter was the description of an elderly man who has multi-infarct dementia, is blind, cannot walk, is doubly incontinent, has lost the ability to swallow and therefore has to have all his food made for him and pureéd. He is not eligible for NHS continuing care. That sparked a discussion about what NHS continuing care is. I do not know whether this is right, but I am interested in the point made by the noble Earl and in these care workers' distinct impression that only when someone has to be peg-fed do they have a remote chance of being considered for NHS continuing care and that that must be but one of their conditions; there must be others, too. I, too, want to know how the criteria for this care, which will be the new revised version of FACS, will work alongside NHS continuing care. Will the Minister tell me for how long on average the 45,000 people who receive NHS continuing care have received it? I am trying to gauge how ill someone has to be to be eligible under the criteria.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="1003011000078"></a>The Bill is an amendment to the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act. So far as I can see in all the debates in another place and here, one issue has not been the subject of any discussion at all, which is rather surprising. When that Act was introduced back in 2003, it introduced intermediate care-an entitlement of six weeks' intensive care which elderly people are supposed to be given to enable them to be discharged from hospital when their medical needs have been attended to. The Bill was introduced with £900 million of funding behind it. I have a series of questions to ask the Minister today. I warned her that I would because it is quite important that we do so.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="1003011000079"></a>When the Act went through Parliament, I asked  a series of questions about how it would work.  The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, gave the  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1197"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assurance that there would be a target; by March 2002, at least 220,000 people would be in receipt of intermediate care, over and above the baseline for 1999. The figures that I have been able to find show that, by the end of 2003, 143,000 people were being given intermediate care. How many people-in the last year for which there are figures-are in receipt of intermediate care, and how many of them received it at home? I ask that for two reasons. First, the term "intermediate care" seems to have disappeared somewhat. I am beginning to pick up on cases in which carers are being told that their relatives are not eligible for intermediate care because they have dementia and so there is no possibility of them improving. There are specific criteria for eligibility for intermediate care, and the Bill proposes three different assessments of a person to determine what sort of care they are eligible for, where they should receive it and for how long. I really would like the Minister to answer this in some detail.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="1003011000080"></a>I am concerned that people are going to find themselves deemed to have met one of the FACS critical criteria, but are not deemed to need assistance with daily living because they have a carer to help them, and therefore they are going to be fobbed off. Is the decision support tool, about which the noble Baroness the Minister talked last week, going to have a consistency across all three of these assessments-NHS continuing care, intermediate care and personal care at home? Further to that, can she say when the fast-track process will be brought into play?</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="1003011000081"></a>Finally, to pick up on the point made by the noble Earl about the potential for local authorities to challenge NHS continuing care decisions that may force people back on to the personal care at home regime, for which the NHS will not be liable to pay, can the noble Baroness say how many PCTs and local authorities have a named lead officer for NHS continuing healthcare funding issues? Increasingly there is the potential for older people and their carers to be stuck between PCTs and local authorities which are in dispute about eligibility. If cases such as the one that I just mentioned are deemed to be ineligible for NHS continuing care, we are into an area of decision-making that is going to be so fine that it is going to take a fair amount of experience on somebody's part to make those judgments with any kind of consistency and lack of bias, so that people are not unfairly dealt with and so that we do not set up yet another lawyers' charter.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="1003011000082"></a>I am asking a very simple thing-how can the policy behind this Bill be implemented in such as way that it does not cause confusion times three, but instead provides clarity and consistency between three different instances of decision-making. I should very much welcome some guidance from the Minister on that.</p>

A serious issue for the Government, which is made worse by this Bill, is the way that at a time when we are saying we want to take down this Berlin Wall, we have created, with the best of intentions, a whole range of areas with scope for more disputes between health and social services. They all had a good reason at the time-intermediate care, continuing care, and now free personal care at home. I wonder whether the Government know how many people are now engaged in these various assessments, how those numbers will be increased by this Bill, and how many people are being diverted from providing care to patients and service users in the area of carrying out assessments and policing those assessments in order to see that their particular organisation is not disadvantaged financially.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="1003011000085"></a>If things have been bad at a time when finances are generous on both sides of the Berlin Wall, they are about to get much worse. There seems likely to be a climate where policing of people's responsibilities organisationally and financially will increase. I ask the Government to think through this much more carefully-I think that it has been considered-and to have a serious discussion with the directors of adult social services about the number of people now entrenched in this work, which is not of great use for the provision of services to people who need them.</p>

"Continuing care" is a term for care provided over an extended period to a person aged 18 or over to meet physical or mental health needs that have arisen as a result of disability, accident or illness. The term covers both NHS and social care services.</p>

<a name="100301-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="1003011000087"></a>"NHS continuing healthcare" means a package of continuing care arranged and funded solely by the NHS. A person is eligible for NHS continuing healthcare if their primary needs-their main needs-are health needs. All primary care trusts and local authorities in England follow a common process to determine eligibility set out in the <I>National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare</I>.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100301-0003.htm"/>


<a name="100301-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="1003011000088"></a>In the third quarter of 2009-10, 50,000 individuals across England were eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, and the number of eligible people continues to increase. However, it is important to recognise that if an individual needs continuing care where their primary needs are not health needs, this will be provided by the local authority, either alone or in partnership with the NHS where appropriate. It is right that, in those circumstances, they should be able to receive personal care free of charge from the local authority if they qualify for it. It is important that NHS continuing healthcare and free personal care are recognised as different ways of delivering health and social care where the balance between health and care may differ.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="1003011000089"></a>It is vital that people do not fall between the health and social care systems. We need to be very clear in guidance that those with continuing needs get the  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1199"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appropriate services, whether that is health or social care. While the number of people who receive NHS continuing healthcare at home is small compared to people receiving NHS continuing care in residential care homes, there are some people at home who meet the criteria.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="1003011000090"></a>We will ensure that the guidance we produce will address the need for primary care trusts and councils to work together to try to ensure a smooth interface between NHS continuing healthcare and free personal care, and that people's needs are identified appropriately.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="1003011000091"></a>Amendment 21 would appear to allow regulations made by the Secretary of State to make specific provision for people who have been deemed eligible for NHS continuing healthcare also to be considered for eligibility for free personal care. The amendment is unnecessary. Where people are deemed eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, the NHS is responsible for providing for all their assessed needs, including personal care if that is part of the overall need. As such, they would not require such free personal care from their local authority because they would already be receiving it for free.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="1003011000092"></a>Amendment 23 would exempt a local authority from providing personal care free of charge to a person who is eligible for or receiving continuing care. As I have explained, "continuing care" can refer to either health or social care services. If an individual needs continuing care, they may require services both from National Health Service bodies and from local authorities. Local authorities should be able also to provide free personal care to such people if they qualify for it.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="1003011000093"></a>However, if an individual is entitled to services as part of NHS continuing healthcare, the person's package of care to meet their assessed needs would be provided solely by the NHS and not the local authority, including any personal care that was required.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="1003011000094"></a>It is important that NHS continuing care and free personal care are recognised as different means of providing health and social care support across the NHS and social care systems. In all cases where it appears to a primary care trust that there may need to be NHS continuing healthcare, the PCT has a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that an assessment of eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare is carried out.</p>

What I believe the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and to some extent the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, were saying is that there may be problems at the interface. We recognise that, and we have already said with respect to the home care that is envisaged as a result of the Bill that we will be issuing very clear guidance. The whole issue of the guidance relative to intermediate care will be covered by my noble friend Lady Thornton as part of the next group.</p>

In October 2007, the Department of Health introduced a national framework for assessing individuals' eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare, replacing the 28 local frameworks previously used by the NHS. A revised version of the national framework was issued in July 2009 to further develop best practice.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1003011000097"></a>A key intention of the national framework was to reduce variations in eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare between PCTs. The data collected show that the variation has reduced significantly since the national framework was introduced.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1003011000098"></a>In addition, all strategic health authorities have developed benchmarking processes that give them detailed information on the numbers eligible in each of the primary care trusts in their area. They are using this to help identify the causes of any variations and the actions needed to address them.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="1003011000099"></a>It is a fair comment that we must get the guidance right in all three areas. We are committed to doing so, and we have shown action with regard to this particular area of NHS continuing care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="1003011000100"></a>I hope, on the basis of what I have said, that the noble Baroness and the noble Earl will not press their amendments.

I found his answer partly reassuring, but we should listen very carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, whose experience in these areas is probably unparalleled among those of us present. He is right. An awful lot of energy and effort are going to be devoted to shoring up a Berlin Wall, and that effort could more productively be devoted, as he rightly said, to looking after people.</p>

I think it is quite important that the guidance goes into some detail to remove some of the potential ambiguities in the terms that are to be used in the regulations. Even if the terms that I have seen in the draft regulations are tightened up, I am sure that there will still be scope for argument. The detail really does matter here.

<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1201"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a period of ill health or a stay in hospital. We know that the Department of Health will issue separate guidance to cover what a reablement package can include. The consultation suggests that this might be physiotherapy, occupational therapy or the installation of telecare or adaptations to the home. People with dementia are significant users of both health and social care. My amendment would encourage NHS and local authorities to have joint responsibility for delivering a health and social care package that could maximise the ability of a person to live independently after, for example, a stay in hospital. I am speaking briefly, as much has already been said on these issues.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="1003011000104"></a>Amendment 34 would ensure that the possibility of reablement is offered to people with dementia, who, as we know, are more likely to stay in hospital for longer than others who go in for the same procedures-the Alzheimer's Society report <I>Counting the Cost</I>, which was produced last year, revealed that people with dementia stay in hospital far longer than those who go in for exactly the same procedure. The longer people with dementia stay in hospital, the worse the effect of the symptoms of dementia and the individual's physical health. Discharge to a care home becomes more likely and anti-psychotic drugs, as we know, are more likely to be used to manage behavioural symptoms. I am concerned that people with dementia may be wrongly excluded from reablement because of the erroneous view that they might not benefit. The amendment would highlight the relevance of reablement whenever possible for people with dementia.</p>

Amendment 28 is simple: it would replace "maximise" with "improve". "Maximise" is the sort of word that should not appear in legislation; it suggests that we should do this whatever the cost, even if it is infinite, which in some cases it could be. "Improve" would be perfectly valid in this context and it would improve the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="1003011000106"></a>Amendment 26, which is the more important of the pair, is very much a probing amendment, as I want to explore the Government's thinking. Everybody is in favour of re-enablement. There is no question but that it is a good thing-the more it can be done successfully, the better. However, the Bill is drafted in such a way that, if an elderly person is not willing to accept a programme for re-enablement, their free personal care can be withdrawn. That kind of thing is quite common in social policy these days, in the same way that if an unemployed person refuses to take a job their allowance can be withdrawn. That is not always wrong, but I am a bit concerned about what this might mean in practice.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="1003011000107"></a>Re-enablement may not be an easy process for the person undergoing it. Physiotherapy can be painful to anybody of any age, but for someone in later life it may be difficult to tolerate. I do not like the idea that a local authority can say, "You get on and do your exercises, Mrs Jones, or we'll take away your free personal care". That is not the kind of relationship that should exist as a result of such legislation. What guidance will the Government offer to prevent this

It is important for us to explore this discretionary activity around reablement and how it will be implemented. This is also our opportunity to look at the Government's thinking on reablement. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, will not mind me teasing him for a moment, but I find it interesting that he called it "re-enablement". That is because he cannot find "reablement" in the dictionary either. It does not appear in any dictionary yet; the term has been developed within social services to talk about rehabilitation. I cannot think of a single way in which it is different, but I will come to the cultural aspects of why it is called something different, because that is important.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="1003011000109"></a>This is exactly what intermediate care was set up to do. Again, therefore, I am afraid that there is extraordinary confusion. It is a bit like the difference between a social care bath and an NHS bath. It is not just the bubble bath that goes in from social services; the question is who delivers it and what the philosophy is. That is also the issue with enablement-I am sorry, I mean "reablement", which is the word that will go into the dictionary eventually.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="1003011000110"></a>I know that the wording of Amendment 26 is probably the reverse of what is desirable, so I will save the Minister the effort of responding to the wording. I am as keen as anybody that there should be the opportunity for people to have a professional assessment to see whether there is room for improvement and  to provide interventions in the physical and social environment that will allow people to function as well as they possibly can. I am worried, however, about how this discretionary intervention will be exercised in practice, particularly in relation to the concerns that were expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, on the previous set of amendments. The opportunities for confusion, for swapping around and for the exercise of discretion as to who pays for what and who does what are really quite frightening. As the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, said, the problem arises in particular in relation to those with dementia, perhaps when they come out of hospital and are assessed for the first time, when there will be opportunities for toing and froing between authorities about who is going to do what.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="1003011000111"></a>The reablement approach is interesting, because it was developed with the sense of a restorative and capacity-building approach to improving the lives of disabled older people. It is as much a philosophical and cultural approach as a specific technique-not doing things for people, but assisting and doing alongside. However, one has to admit that there are at the moment no long-term studies that have demonstrated its efficacy over the longer term for people with a level of disability who will be the recipients of the free personal care. We are talking about a seriously disabled group of people. All successful studies have used very high levels of intervention. The Government's short-term studies are encouraging for people of all ages and show that one can achieve a small but significant reduction in

However, it is important to note that the studies in the care services delivery efficiency programme focused not only on those practical aspects of daily living that are the subject of this Bill but on much broader criteria of success. The interventions were often for longer than six weeks and for far more hours than is being proposed here. In fact, the cost of those successful schemes was more than what has been allocated for the reablement process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="1003011000112"></a>I suppose that a purist would point out that it is rather bizarre to implement reablement intervention as a prerequisite for receiving assistance, when the long-term studies currently in progress have not reported yet. We know that schemes are nearly always successful in their pilot phases, but long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness may be difficult to predict. Given how often I have personally pushed for things to be rolled out when there is some indication of support, I have some sympathy with the Government in wanting to do this. However, we should realise that reablement has so far been shown to be effective on, for example, mentally alert people who, after a short stay in hospital with a fractured femur, are coming out and need to get their confidence back. In that scenario, it can be quite successful. However, the Government's short-term studies, which are fine as far as they go, show that reablement is less effective for those with severe disabilities over a longer period. It can be effective, but there is a group of people for whom an intensive, much longer period of care will be required. I have great doubts about the amount that will be required to get the improvements needed within the proposed level of reablement input. That is the purpose of this probing amendment.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="1003011000113"></a>As for Amendment 28, one should bear in mind that, for example, following a stroke or a head injury, maximum performance will not be achieved for perhaps more than two years, which would be a long time after the reablement process had finished. Therefore, I wonder whether the word "maximise" is quite right. I suggest that "significantly improve" would be a more appropriate phrase, particularly for people with mental health problems.</p>

I want to probe some of the areas mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, again in the context of intermediate care provisions, about which I have previously spoken. Just as intermediate care provisions have an interplay with NHS continuing care, so they do with personal care at home.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="1003011000115"></a>I have a tremendous amount of sympathy with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. I am a fan of reablement. I was a big fan of it when it was called rehabilitation and I was just as big a fan when it was called good hospital discharge. It works tremendously well for a number of people. An older person who has had a stroke and has lost their confidence would value having someone to help them through the processes of returning home and learning to cope again. Sometimes it is a rather crude tool, while the strictures around it and the question of who pays for it have sometimes militated against the policy being as effective as it could be.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="1003011000116"></a>Some people come out of hospital and just want to go home. That is the most important thing to them. They do not want to go for weeks to a place where they do not know anyone to have an intensive period of what they consider to be treatment. They do not want that and they do not feel in charge of it. Some people want to stay with relatives for a while until they get themselves back together. If they choose to do that, sometimes they are deemed to be ineligible for intermediate care and they might be ineligible for personal care at home. However, some of them really need the services. What happens to people who need the services but who refuse to go through the particular pathway set out in this Bill?</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="1003011000117"></a>I concede that much good has been done with the £900 million of intermediate care services, but some of the times and ways in which that policy has been implemented have not been particularly effective. An older person with a broken arm or leg probably could do with a period of reablement or rehabilitation when their cast is removed, which may be more than six weeks after they come out of hospital. However, they are not allowed to have that because it does not fall within the timeframe. When the Minister talks about intermediate care, as I know she will, will she say whether this Bill is an admission that for quite a number of older people that arbitrary six-week time limit has been ineffective?</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="1003011000118"></a>Also, does the Minister share my concern that there has already been a considerable amount of rebadging-that is a new term, I think, but it has an awful lot of currency in the NHS these days-of intermediate care? I am thinking of things such as rapid response services, which now seem to be the flavour of the day. I do not have a problem with people choosing to call their services new things; I do not even have a problem with the services being given new and better purposes. However, I have a significant problem when money flows behind them in covert ways. That is what I am trying to get to the heart of: where does the money behind this system go? How is that tied to the assessment criteria and the eligibility criteria?</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="1003011000119"></a>Finally, health and social care professionals are increasingly having to deal with a particular group of people whose need for services has not changed but for whom the money has run out. These people have funded their care for so long that they have run out of capital and resources. They have very significant needs, so how and when will they move into eligibility either for NHS continuing care or for free personal care? Their needs are very high; it is just that their resources have run out. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, is right: soon we will be back to a time when the assessment of clinical and social care needs will be governed largely by money. In our debate we need to do our best to prevent that.</p>

I come at this from a rather different angle from the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, although I very much identified with all that she said.</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="1003011000121"></a>Reablement, as we have heard, is to be a precondition for receiving free personal care at home, but the way that reablement is offered and delivered to people will  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1205"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be very much a matter for local authorities to determine. Local authorities that are strapped for cash will be tempted to use reablement as a way of putting off the day when they have to decide one way or the other on a person's eligibility for free personal care. Therefore, in the first instance I am worried that the process of reablement could be delayed, whether deliberately or not, as a means of postponing the burden of costs arising from having to give free care. How will authorities be monitored and held to account for the way in which they deliver reablement? What will prevent them from using reablement as a tool for withholding free personal care from those who would otherwise be eligible for it?</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="1003011000122"></a>My second worry is very similar. There appears to be no limit to the number of times a local authority would be able to insist that someone went through  a reablement process. The Minister in another place said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="1003011000208"></a>"There are currently no proposals to restrict packages of re-ablement. It will be for councils to determine who might benefit from the intervention and whether it is appropriate to repeat this at a later date".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 8/12/09; col. 292W.]</p>

<p><a name="1003011000197"></a>In other words, people could be put through it at frequent intervals-not for their own benefit so much as for the local authority's benefit, in the hope that the obligation to deliver free personal care might be avoided following a further assessment of the person's ability to cope with the activities of daily living. Again, what is to stop this unreasonable use of reablement from happening?</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="1003011000123"></a>For some people, a process of reablement will do little or no good, and may even end up doing harm; those nearing the end of their lives are one example. In some of these cases it will be possible to predict that reablement will be burdensome and at best unlikely to be of more than temporary benefit. While I can readily accept that a refusal to undergo reablement will, in many cases, debar a person from an entitlement to free care-and rightly so-there will be other cases where a refusal is perfectly reasonable in the prevailing circumstances. The noble Baroness illustrated one or two of those examples. How will the system be able to distinguish between those two types of case and what safeguards will there be for service users in that context?</p>

<a name="100301-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="1003011000124"></a>The Equality and Human Rights Commission has developed that point further. It argues that some people may not want or may not be able to accept or understand that they need social care and support services because of impairment of their faculties, pride, their wish to remain independent or simply because they are in denial that they have become disabled and are in need of care services. In those circumstances, it cannot be right for free personal care to be refused on the grounds that someone had rejected a council's package of reablement.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="1003011000125"></a>Lastly, I am concerned that reablement should not be withheld from someone merely on the grounds that the person's carer has refused to take an active part in the process. The fact that someone has an unpaid carer may or may not provide a useful means of support for a local authority in the way that reablement is delivered to the person. But the active involvement of the carer should never be made a precondition of reablement if for any reason the carer does not want to

If the reablement is to be the subject of free support financially, does it have to take place at home or can it sometimes take place more satisfactorily in residential care on a short-term basis? In administering a retirement village outside York, we found that people leaving hospital often did not go straight home but spent time in the intermediate care phase in a residential setting. Would they then forfeit the opportunity to receive financial help with a reablement package that would be available only if they went straight home? Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.</p>

<a name="1003011000127"></a><b><a name="100301-0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1003011000600"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, I will be replying  to this group of amendments which involves a  substantial discussion on reablement, including Amendment 24 from the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, Amendment 25 from the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, Amendments 26 and 28 from the noble Lords, Lord Warner and Lord Lipsey, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, Amendment 30 from the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and Amendment 34 from the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross. The amendments deal with the Bill's provisions on reablement. As has been clear from the discussion, they deal with different aspects so it might be useful to touch on what reablement means to the individual and how it fits into the wider range of services on offer, and to explore the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about intermediate care. At its heart is the intention to help individuals to maximise their ability to look after themselves.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="1003011000128"></a>We have sometimes talked about intermediate care and reablement interchangeably. In essence, both reablement and intermediate care try to do the same thing. They have the same objective of helping to maximise a person's abilities and independence, but come at the problem from different angles. Intermediate care is often linked to people coming out of acute hospital care and returning to live in the community and there is often a health element to that care as well as social care. Reablement is a more preventive approach, identifying people at risk of having to go into hospital or residential care and putting in support to maintain people's independence to help them remain in the community. That might include specialist help to rebuild a person's physical skills and confidence. To answer the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Best, reablement can be offered in a residential care setting.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="1003011000129"></a>The aim is to maximise that person's independence. It means often looking at how the home environment can support independence. Indeed, at an earlier stage of the Committee, we looked at the range of aids and adaptations that might help people. Grab rails, telecare, adaptations of showers, stair lifts and disabled facilities grants transform the home environment. Regardless of the terminology, what is on offer is simple to understand-and it is widely supported and, indeed, it is already happening. The introduction of this Bill will enable us to provide further funding of £130 million to encourage more people to benefit. In  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1207"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>answer to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, this is not about substitution; this is about adding to it.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="1003011000130"></a>There is powerful evidence that reablement works. A research study by the University of York demonstrated that the benefits of reablement are not just immediate, but are long lasting. This is why we believe that it is such an important part of the Bill. Reablement and intermediate care services of various kinds have been developed in many parts of the country. We want to encourage councils to offer reablement to more people wherever that is appropriate and to make it a standard part of how they support people's needs, rather than assuming that care needs will stay the same or increase. This is not about forcing people to do things, but working with them and their carers and families to put them in the best possible shape. We recognise that there will be some people for whom reablement is not appropriate, and we believe it is right to let councils have the flexibility to make sensible judgments about the individual circumstances in which it is appropriate to offer it. Our guidance will address that issue.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="1003011000131"></a>I want to address the specific points that noble Lords have made about the cost of reablement-it is £130 million-and we believe that this will mean that 130,000 people could benefit from reablement as part of the Bill. There is already money in the system to meet some of these needs. What we are doing now through the Personal Care at Home Bill is making more money available to encourage councils to offer more support to more people. Current community care funding provides for aids and equipment. For example, last year we invested £80 million to encourage council investment in telecare and we allocated £168 million for adaptations through disabled facilities grants.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="1003011000132"></a>Amendment 24 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, seeks to enable the making of regulations to require local authorities and PCTs to work together to assess needs and deliver reablement. It is indeed important, of course, that local authorities and partners in health work together effectively to support people. I agree with the motives of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, in proposing this amendment. It is vital that local authorities and their partners work together effectively. For the person who has a wide range of health and social care needs, it really does not matter whether what they are receiving is a social care bath or a health bath. Indeed, that interface, as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Warner, is at the crux of much of the care that we want people to benefit from. We recognise that they have to work together effectively, and if they do not it creates anxiety and is very frustrating.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="1003011000133"></a>In <I>Putting People First</I>, we have set out the cross-government strategy to transform adult social care. We recognise how important integrated working is across these sectors, and, in fact, we gave £520 million to councils help them with that. We will be developing guidance which recommends that local authorities work with colleagues in NHS primary care trusts where it is appropriate. An acceptance of the noble Baroness's amendment, however, could force local authorities to consult a primary care trust where, in some cases, there may not be a need to do so.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="1003011000134"></a>I turn to Amendment 25 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. In its present form the Bill makes explicit reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="1003011000217"></a>"a process designed to maximise the person's ability to live independently".</ul>
<p><a name="1003011000198"></a>We are calling this process reablement. The Bill allows regulations to be made that will give local authorities the discretion to use a period of reablement as one of the criteria for determining eligibility for free personal care. This does not mean that local authorities should force everyone to undergo such a period of reablement. That is not our intention as in some cases reablement will be neither appropriate nor beneficial to the individual. However, many people can potentially benefit from reablement and we believe that local authorities should be encouraged to make greater use of these services where they are already available and established, and develop them further where provision is currently lacking.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="1003011000135"></a>New Subsection (4C) explicitly sets out the power that will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to achieve this, which will be accompanied by detailed guidance on how local authorities should decide whether or not reablement would be appropriate for the individual.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="1003011000136"></a>The noble Baroness asked about a person's means, what happens when their money runs out, and when they will become eligible for free personal care. Continuing care is never means-tested. The Bill is designed to support those people who might well have already used substantial personal means to support their care needs, so it will help to provide some relief for them. My noble friend Lord Lipsey, the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, all asked about a person who is not willing to accept reablement, and whether that person could have their free personal care withdrawn. That would be a very heavy-handed tool. It is proposed that free personal care could be refused only where the person had-I think that the noble Earl said this-unreasonably refused that reablement. That will be set out in regulations and is an issue that would have to be treated with great sensitivity. In choosing to refuse an offer that is reasonable, they could not be eligible for free care under the scheme and would have to make a contribution to the cost of their own care. However, it is a very sensitive issue. In an earlier debate, we covered the issue of carers and unpaid carers not being part of the assessment that would take place for free personal care.</p>

I noted the noble Baroness's distinction about intermediate care being provided to people who have been in hospital. How many people is it envisaged will meet the FACS criteria who will not have been in hospital? We are talking about people who will be very ill and very disabled even though they may not have had acute care. For very many older people who may or may not be eligible for care under this measure, simply maintaining their ability to live independently at a level of operation which is perhaps lower than it was before they were ill-for example, if they have had a stroke-will be a good result. It is not about improving their ability to live independently because, for some of them, it probably cannot be improved; it can only be maintained at a lower level. Is it the intention of this Bill, clumsily worded though it is, to reflect that-that some people will not improve as a result of reablement, but will simply continue to be able to cope and perhaps at a reduced level? That is an important point to make and make clear for people who may be doing assessments in the future.</p>

On the first, I can think of three people I know who are not in hospital, but who are definitely disabled. Whether they would qualify under this scheme, I do not know. It is very unlikely that they would be in hospital unless something acute happened, though there is no question that they are disabled. The point about reablement is that, if the reablement process-we will talk about "improvement" and "maximise" in a moment-actually enables that person to maintain the level of independence that they already have, it seems to me that that has also succeeded and would count. On the question about the number of FACS-critical people who have been in hospital, we have not collected that information in this form. However, the noble Baroness makes a valid point indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="1003011000142"></a>Amendment 26, in the names of the noble Lords, Lords Warner and Lord Lipsey, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, would seek to change new subsection (4C). It would mean that any regulations which the Secretary of State makes under subsection (4A) that give local authorities functions relating to eligibility for free provision of personal care must specifically allow them to use reablement as an eligibility criterion. I understand that this is a probing amendment, and I hope that I have answered some of the points, but we have been clear from the start that the Bill must enable a two-pronged approach: providing free personal care to those with the highest needs who are living at home, accompanied by a period of intensive support or reablement for all those who would benefit from such a package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="1003011000143"></a>We do not think that it is necessary to dictate the content of the regulations in the Bill.

<p><a name="1003011000199"></a>The noble Lords and the noble Baroness have suggested that we should replace "maximise" with the word "improve". We do not feel that this best defines reablement. Improvement could mean only a small change in what may already be very poor circumstances. In fact, our aspirations for reablement are that it should do better than this. We want to help individuals to become as well as possible, not only to improve their status, but to maximise their ability to live independently. Therefore, we think that "maximise" is a better fit than "improve" for what we understand reablement to mean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="1003011000145"></a>I think that I agree with the aim of Amendment 30, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. Although reablement will have many benefits for the majority of people, we recognise that in some cases it would have limited or no benefit and would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are very frail or who are receiving end-of-life care. We will place in statutory guidance advice around when reablement may or may not be appropriate, along with advice on how a suitable package should be developed with input from and consultation with the individual, their carers and any relevant health and social care professionals.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="1003011000146"></a>Amendment 34, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, would permit regulations to enable a local authority and primary care trust to offer a package of reablement and intermediate care to a person after they had stayed in hospital for more than one week.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="1003011000147"></a>All local authorities can already deliver packages of reablement, helping people to maximise their ability to live at home independently. These packages are most effective when they include a range of interventions to meet a person's range of needs. A package of reablement or intermediate care can, and should, involve a variety of health and social care professionals, along with other interventions, minor aids or adaptations.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="1003011000148"></a>We will be outlining in statutory guidance how we expect local authorities to develop a personalised package of reablement for individuals, and we will make it clear that the person receiving the package, along with their carers, GP and other professionals, should be involved as necessary. We think that this is more suitable for guidance than regulations but we accept the point made in the noble Baroness's amendment.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="1003011000150"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, commented on long-term studies. We think that the reablement component increases the amount available to all those presenting for social care, and that it will reduce levels of dependence and may well delay or prevent people needing intensive support. The intention is to focus not just on this group; we believe that reablement has a role to play for a range of groups, including those with dementia or a head injury. As I mentioned earlier, York University has already carried out some studies on this, and we will be assessing the situation in 12 to 18 months' time.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="1003011000151"></a>The Bill is about the free provision of personal care by local authorities and not the NHS. In any event, there will be some circumstances in which it will be more appropriate for the service to be offered solely by either the NHS or social care. We do not want to create fresh barriers, which some of these amendments would bring about, to the most effective delivery of services to individuals. The forthcoming White Paper will reaffirm our commitment to the health and social care systems working together much more effectively as part of a future reform of the care service. Therefore, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I asked a number of such questions of the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, and I quite understand why he did not answer them. However, in particular, I should like to have updated figures for the number of people in receipt of intermediate care and for the number of PCTs and local authorities that have a named lead officer. That would be extraordinarily helpful to Members of the Committee.</p>

I had marked up answers to a lot of her questions and I believe I have now found some of them. The latest figures show that 28,116 intermediate care places benefited 132,720 people between April and June 2008. Compared with 1999-2000, the number of intermediate care beds has doubled, and the number of intermediate care places in non-residential settings has trebled. Three times as many people are benefiting from intermediate care. The NHS Plan aimed for an extra 6,700 places for intermediate care by March 2005-5,000 residential and 1,700 non-residential-and today the NHS has delivered an extra 22,948 places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="1003011000154"></a>In her previous question, the noble Baroness raised the issue of the guidance. The original guidance has been strengthened to include flexibility over the period of an intermediate care episode-which I think is the point that she raised. That will ensure that people with dementia have access to intermediate care, with that care being commissioned across health and social care, and that reablement services are part of the commissioned service, widening access to intermediate care to include all adult age groups, not just older people.</p>

One of the most striking features of the Explanatory Notes is the length and complexity of the Government's defence of the legality of the Bill in relation to the convention. Of course it is very helpful to see that defence set out in clear terms, but I cannot remember another Bill where it has been necessary to do this to quite the same extent. The obvious conclusion from this is that, even though the Government's human rights justification may be correct in its bald terms, we are, nevertheless, on quite tricky legal ground. We have already considered the issue of discrimination against deafblind people arising from the Bill and its regulations, so I shall not dwell upon those arguments a second time.</p>

<a name="100301-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="1003011000158"></a>The other type of discrimination to which the Bill potentially gives rise relates to residents of care homes. It would be perfectly possible for those people to argue that their personal care needs are every bit as critical as those of someone who happens to be living at home and that this discrimination against them amounts to a breach of Article 14 of the convention, taken with Article 1 of Protocol 1, which covers the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Indeed, the department accepts that it is a prima facie breach of Article 14 to discriminate between one person and another on the basis of where each of them lives. Nevertheless, the Government maintain that the different treatment of people living at home is not discriminatory because the policy underlying the different treatment pursues,</p>
<ul><a name="1003011000219"></a>"a legitimate aim in a proportionate way".</ul>
<a name="100301-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="1003011000159"></a>As this is a framework Bill, an enabling Bill, it would be hard to argue that the Bill itself was incompatible with the convention. The issue, rather, is whether the policy to which the future regulations will give substance does indeed pursue a legitimate aim in a proportionate way. As regards the aim of the Bill, and the aim of the regulations, it would be difficult to show that these were in any way illegitimate. So I shall not spend time  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1213"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arguing that case. However, on the issue of proportionality, there is quite a lot that we can say. The Explanatory Notes say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="1003011000210"></a>"The key aim of the policy behind the Bill is to enable, support and encourage more people to avoid or delay entering residential accommodation ... It is considered that the proposals are proportionate as they are aimed at those people in highest need-the group of people who are most at risk of having to enter residential accommodation".</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100301-0005.htm"/>


<a name="100301-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="1003011000160"></a>The message that I take away from that is that, as long as the Government's assumptions prove to be correct as regards the number of people who are likely to benefit from the legislation, the policy is unlikely to breach the convention. The problem, it seems to me, arises if the Government's assumptions are not correct. As we have said a number of times, the figures quoted in the impact assessment come with a giant health warning. At best, they are an approximation; at worst, they bear little or no relation to reality. So we need to ask: what would happen if the numbers of those eligible for free care in the home turned out to be much larger than the numbers postulated in the impact assessment? What would happen if local authorities are unable to make efficiency savings sufficient to cover their share of the cost of delivering free care? What would happen if, as a number of councils are arguing, it proves impossible to deliver free care to a satisfactory standard within the assumed cash limits? The Government's assumption is that the time taken to deliver help with four activities of daily living is roughly one hour per service user per day, but some councils are saying that it would be double that. What if they are right?</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="1003011000161"></a>The money would have to be found from somewhere. It could be found from an increase in council tax. It could be found from cuts in other local authority budgets. It could be found from increased charges for personal care to those who are not receiving their care free. Or it could be found by reducing the amount of personal care being delivered to those same people. If it is the last of these, we are in dangerous territory as far as the European convention is concerned. If local authorities were to withhold personal care from people who are in critical need but who require help with fewer than four activities of daily living, or if they were to withhold it from people with substantial care needs or from people with care needs in a lower banding, it could well make those people decide to move into residential care rather than to be enabled to stay at home.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="1003011000162"></a>In that situation we could indeed see more people receiving free care in their homes, but possibly fewer people receiving care in their homes overall. Should that occur, then a breach of Article 14 is a real possibility, because the Bill would have failed to achieve its stated objective of enabling more people to avoid or delay entering residential accommodation. We would have spent a lot of money favouring one group of people at the expense of a larger group of people. It could be argued that the result would be a disproportionate way of pursuing the policy objective.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="1003011000163"></a>In other words, ECHR compliance will be a matter of fact rather than theory. With all the uncertainties over the costing of the policy and all the worries being expressed by local authorities about its affordability,  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1214"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we cannot know how things will pan out in practice. We therefore have to plan ahead on the basis that human rights compliance will need to be regularly monitored. This amendment is designed simply to ensure that that is done, and done in a way that is visible to Parliament. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="1003011000165"></a>The amendment focuses on the compatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights and the requirements of reporting on that. As noble Lords may be aware, the Equality and Human Rights Commission helpfully produced a briefing on the Bill. I shall highlight some key points. I am very pleased that the commission broadly welcomes the Government's commitment to provide personal care free of charge in certain circumstances to people with the highest needs and the additional investment in the wider social care system and acknowledges the importance of reablement.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="1003011000166"></a>In the commission's view, the Bill does not discriminate against those in residential care and the policy of providing free personal care at home is reasonably and objectively justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, and is thus compliant with obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. We recognise that the commission has some underlying concerns about implementation and the impact on others with social care needs should local authorities not realign their services as a result of the Bill. We are committed to addressing these concerns as part of supporting councils to prepare for implementation and we hope that some of the debate in Committee has gone some way to reassuring the commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="1003011000167"></a>Amendment 36 would require the Secretary of State to report annually to Parliament on the compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights of regulations relating to the provision of free personal care at home. As the Bill states, it has already been certified that in our view the Bill is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, and a detailed, well read and thorough memorandum setting out the reasons for this has been sent to the Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="1003011000168"></a>In addition, the committee requested further evidence in relation to specific questions relating to the European Convention on Human Rights issues around the Bill, which the Minister for Care Services responded to on 29 January. We will give careful consideration to any points raised by the Joint Committee in its final report. The Government already seek to ensure that any secondary legislation and guidance are compatible with the convention, as required by the Human Rights Act 1998. The regulations which the Secretary of State will be enabled to make by this Bill, and any related guidance, will be no different in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="1003011000169"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked why the note was so long. This is because of Article 14 of the convention. The words cannot simply be taken at face

Essentially, he is quite right to point out that this fails the first test of discrimination, but it is justified by the argument that the policy is a proportionate response to a need. To quote the memo:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="1003011000211"></a>"The Department's view is that the different treatment of people living at home is not discriminatory. This is because the policy underlying the different treatment pursues a legitimate aim in a proportionate way."</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="1003011000170"></a>It has been argued that this is okay, provided that we are actually delivering the policy. I would not like to give the sense that we will not deliver the policy, as we believe that we will and that none of the traps or problems that have been used to illustrate the case will occur. It is very important, on this legalistically technical point, to realise just how far the policy would have to go before it was in any way threatened by the Human Rights Act, because the Act is about protecting individuals from an overbearing state. The Court has been particularly concerned that social policy should be an area where a wide measure of appreciation is accorded to the state by the Court, and I am told that "appreciation" is code for "latitude". It was also noted that, where there is a general rule, a line must be drawn, and it is for Parliament to decide where to draw it.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="1003011000171"></a>The House of Lords noted that social policy is an area where the Court should be very slow to substitute its view for that of the Executive, especially where the discrimination is not on one of the express, or primary, grounds. Even under the most difficult circumstances, it is difficult to believe that the convention would be threatened. Nevertheless, we are concerned that this policy should be successful, and we have already said that there will be a review after 12 to 18 months. That review will need to assure itself that the policy is succeeding and is achieving proportionality. Through the process of looking at the Act and making sure all the orders and regulations are compatible, I believe there will be no risk that the Bill, its policy and its implementation will be incompatible with the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="1003011000172"></a>The amendment would impose an unnecessary requirement, particularly as the regulations are highly unlikely to change annually. Given the generality of the Human Rights Act, which I have tried to describe, together with the fact that we will have a review and that the Government are generally bound by the Human Rights Act to implement policy in a way that is compatible with that Act, I hope the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I will not go back over all our objections to Clause 1, which we laid out in Committee. I will instead restrict comments to this amendment. As was highlighted during the Committee's consideration of this clause, and as was hinted at earlier, Ofcom already has a duty to encourage efficient investment in infrastructure, so could the Minister explain why we need a new duty on top of the established one? What difference will this new duty make? Will it not, as my noble friend Lady Buscombe said, simply muddy the waters?</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="1003011000182"></a>There could well be duplication and confusion from Ofcom exercising its functions under the Communications Act 2003 and the duty that the Government have set out in this Bill. We asked similar questions in Committee, but the answers were not enlightening. The Minister argued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="1003011000213"></a>"It is right that the regulator should be responsible for this".</p>

<p><a name="1003011000200"></a>We agree but, as has been pointed out, under Section 3 of the Communications Act 2003 the regulator is already responsible for this issue, so I am not reassured by this argument. More significantly, when addressing the specific question of whether the duty was needed, and whether there would be any overlapping, the Minister argued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="1003011000214"></a>"It is necessary and there will be no duplication, because we are doing this only once".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/1/10; col. 155.]</p>

<p><a name="1003011000201"></a>I am not entirely certain what that means. The key concern with this clause is that it does not seem necessary. It will, we feel, simply create confusion and overlapping functions. Could the Minister explain more fully quite why he thinks that this will not be the case and what is so wrong with Ofcom's existing duties, which include encouraging investment in infrastructure, that it is necessary to repeat this part of their duties? If the purpose is to underline this part of those duties, could it not have been done in a way that made the point without resorting to legislation?</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="1003011000183"></a>The Government argued that the duty was needed because of,</p>
<ul><a name="1003011000220"></a>"the specific importance of investment in electronic networks at a time when many of our communication networks are being substantively upgraded".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/1/10; col. 163.]</ul>
<p><a name="1003011000202"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could explain why the existing duty cannot deliver these upgrades. For instance, digital television switchover is already happening. It is being funded by the licence fee and, as far as I am aware, Ofcom does not have much of a role in the process. I would imagine that radio switchover could happen in much the same way.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="1003011000184"></a>I do not doubt that the regulatory environment needs to change to help to speed up investment in next-generation broadband, but would it not have been better to identify which specific measures are needed? Instead, we have this broad yet unfocused power that the Government are not entirely sure will result in much change. I am afraid that it looks as if the Government are simply adding a duty to give the appearance of action. As with so many things, the Government's response to a problem seems to be more regulation. Unless the Minister can explain exactly what marks out the duty as necessary and distinct from an existing duty, there is no reason to include it in the Bill and there is certainly no reason for this part of the clause. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="1003011000221"></a>"to promote ... investment in electronic communications networks".</ul>
<p><a name="1003011000203"></a>There is a clear requirement on Ofcom to consider promotion of investment systematically. Currently, Ofcom is required simply to have regard to the desirability of encouraging investment when it appears to be relevant in the circumstances. It is therefore a significant change of emphasis and an important change in the way in which Ofcom carries out its duties. It would be incredibly short-sighted of us to miss this opportunity to ensure that the regulatory environment for these vital sectors encourages investment and growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="1003011000186"></a>Our policy objective as set out in the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper was clear that the general duties of Ofcom should be qualified by the need to promote investment. We concluded that the best way of achieving this was by the creation of a new Section 3(1A) (a), (b) and (c), which place a specific requirement on Ofcom to,</p>
<ul><a name="1003011000222"></a>"promote ... investment in electronic communications networks",</ul>

The result is a series of proposed amendments today-Amendments 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. The new wording clarifies how the clause will work in practice.</p>

<a name="100301-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="1003011000187"></a>As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn admirably said in Committee, maintaining the duty for Ofcom to promote investment in infrastructure and public service content so as to help to secure our economic and social prosperity in the future,</p>
<ul><a name="1003011000223"></a>"seems entirely sensible, even highly desirable".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/1/10; col. 161.]</ul>
<p><a name="1003011000205"></a>Removing that obligation on Ofcom to promote investment in our communications networks of the future would send an entirely wrong message about our commitment to such a programme of improvement. The duty will not cause confusion. It would not be right to state specific measures, but it is important to encourage investment when it appears to be relevant in the circumstances. It is an important change of emphasis; it is now a principal duty. I hope that in the light of that explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="1003011000190"></a>In Committee, a number of your Lordships questioned the meaning of "efficient" investment and the suitability of the phrase "appropriate levels of investment". Certain of your Lordships were also concerned that the clause, as written, failed to address what they saw as the failure of Ofcom to fulfil its duties to citizens. We have looked at whether changes to the wording of the subsection might be improved to reflect the Government's intention and we are, as a result, proposing a package of changes to new subsection (1A) that I trust will meet the concerns raised in Committee.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="1003011000191"></a>I want to make it clear that Ofcom's principal consideration when making any decision must be the interests of citizens and consumers. The new duty is an aspect of that obligation. We are not introducing a power for Ofcom to impact on individual companies' investment decisions. Instead, the provision is intended to ensure that, as many of your Lordships argued in Committee, when Ofcom is taking regulatory decisions  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1222"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it has in mind the need for investment in public service media content and networks fit for ever increasing demands and next-generation technologies, for the benefit of all and not just the companies involved.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="1003011000192"></a>The amendments in this group, I hope, make this clearer by setting out more clearly what is meant by the words "efficient investment". This is, in the broadest sense, what we generally refer to as economically efficient, taking into account the benefits to investors, consumers and wider society. This definition therefore now captures investment that is efficient in commercial or social terms. Investment in public service media content, for example, would be efficient if the social benefits to citizens outweighed the cost of providing the content.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="1003011000193"></a>A question was also raised as to whether the reference to "appropriate levels of investment" was appropriate. We have looked again at this. Consequently, we are proposing amendments to paragraphs (a) and (b), which will require Ofcom to consider whether it would be appropriate to promote investment per se, rather than require it to make a specific judgment on the level of investment that would be appropriate in a given instance.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="1003011000194"></a>Finally, there was uncertainty about how this new subsection relates to the existing provisions in Section 3(4) of the Communications Act. To put this beyond doubt, the intention is to require Ofcom to give precedence to the need to promote investment where there is a tension between this need and the subsection (4) matters.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="1003011000195"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that these amendments make the intention of the clause clearer and that they appropriately reflect the need for Ofcom to promote the interests of citizens and consumers. I therefore ask your Lordships to support these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

There are still issues with the clause, but I will save those worries for my amendments. For now,  I shall turn my attention to the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government. I am grateful for the explanation provided in correspondence by the Minister regarding the Government's thinking on these amendments. As he said, they have had to go back to the drawing board on the specific issue of efficient investment. I was slightly worried that by addressing one concern, the Government may have raised others, but I hope that this debate can lay those to rest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="1003014000002"></a>This clause now states that Ofcom will promote investment in "electronic communications networks" and "public service media content", where appropriate. That is an important distinction. However, it throws up a number of important questions about the meaning of the word "appropriate", which were not dealt with in Committee. For instance, who decides when an investment is appropriate? By what criteria will such an investment be judged? Will investment be considered appropriate if it leads to faster broadband speeds, greater profits for a company or greater competition in the market? Depending on what criteria are used to define "appropriate", the outcome could be markedly different.</p>

<p><a name="1003014000029"></a>I agree. There are always other considerations that will need to be taken into account in determining whether the investment is justifiable on public policy grounds. The Minister referred to those of those a few moments ago. Some clarity on the Government's definition of appropriateness would be helpful, not least for the regulator who will need to balance these new duties with existing ones.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="1003014000004"></a>The addition of the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="1003014000036"></a>"taking account of the interests of citizens and the interests of consumers in relevant markets",</ul>
<p><a name="1003014000030"></a>presumably ensures that the interests of consumers will be considered when determining the appropriateness of an investment. But what other factors should be considered? Perhaps I am in danger of reading too much into this, but I cannot help thinking that "where appropriate" could just be a generic phrase that gives the regulator enormous leeway in making its decisions. There is a danger that such leeway could create uncertainty for the industry, as businesses will find it difficult to know how the duty will be interpreted.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="1003014000005"></a>All organisations need certainty and a clear and level regulatory playing field. The telecommunications sector is no different, and given the amount of investment required to upgrade the country's communications networks and the length of time required for a return on such an investment, anything that muddies the waters or causes doubt should give pause for thought. Is the Minister confident that the addition of "where appropriate" will not lead to uncertainty-uncertainty that threatens the investment this duty is designed to promote? Finally, can he reassure those of us who remain unconvinced that this clause is needed at all that these amendments significantly enhance those duties that Ofcom already has?</p>

It is primarily lack of investment in much of the infrastructure, particularly in local and rural areas, that has given rise to Amendment 9A to which I will speak later. The amendment stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Laird, and I would have added my name to it if I had not been away. I am sorry about that.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="1003014000007"></a>I welcome Amendment 7 which will remind Ofcom of its duty to take into account the interests of citizens. It is all too easy to think of these things in terms of business and profitability, but there comes a point when we must invest in infrastructure. It will not necessarily be seen to be efficient in business terms to start with, but we will get huge rewards further down the line and in other areas of life which may not be strictly relevant to the communications market but will be relevant to many other markets.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="1003014000009"></a>I learnt something new this weekend. I came across a new word: exabyte. I have never heard that before. An exabyte is a billion gigabytes, or a billion billion bytes-it is a pretty big number. In 2005, mankind created 150 exabytes; in 2010, 1,200 were created. So, over five years the total amount of data created on earth went up by a factor of 10, and I suspect the rate of increase is going to continue on an exponential basis. If we were standing here in two or three years perhaps we would need another word for a thousand exabytes. I do not know whether there is such a word; maybe there is.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="1003014000010"></a>Even since the Digital Economy Bill was introduced in your Lordships' House three months ago there have been many changes. We have had two major exhibitions in the world: the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and a month later the GSM Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. At both those events, major new products were introduced which were dramatic and will change the face of the whole industry. There have been smart phones, tablets, and of course a month ago Apple announced its iPad tablet. On the subject of Apple, last week it recorded 10 billion downloads from iTunes-nearly two for every person living on this earth. As I mentioned once before, there have been 3 billion downloads of apps for the iPhone. Convergence, about which we have talked many times in this House, is now a factor of life; it is happening at a very dramatic rate. Also since the Bill was introduced, we have heard that in the United States, AT&amp;T's network has been struggling with the amount of data required, and O2 has reported problems coping with the amount of data on a broadband basis or mobile network basis.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="1003014000011"></a>To return to the word "appropriate", I want to make the point that I do not like the tone of the word. It does not feel right. It feels, as the Minister himself said in a meeting with me, as though the word is limp. It certainly does not capture the change that is taking place in this industry. It would be more appropriate if we were talking about agriculture or the steel industry, but the IT and mobile industry is changing so fast that we need something that recognises that change more, dare I say it, appropriately.</p>

I am pleased that we have made some progress in trying to address the problem. I would say to my noble friend that he should take the amendments as a whole. The previous amendment elevated the role of Ofcom to ensure that investment in electronic communication networks was one of its principal duties, which is an important change. I have been trying to get something helpful rather than a legal definition that might engender more of a collective groan than anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="1003014000013"></a>However, this is not about particular investment decisions but about the creation of a regulatory climate that encourages investment. I know that that is what

He seeks to encourage investment in an environment where, as he eloquently described to us, demand is exponential. What is interesting is that so far, and there is no room for complacency, we have managed to meet that demand. We know that there are other things we need to do in terms of the UK providing universal broadband and super broadband and we are focusing on those areas.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="1003014000014"></a>I also want to make it clear in relation to the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that Ofcom's principal consideration when making any decisions must be the interests of citizens and consumers, and the new duty is an aspect of that obligation. We are not introducing a power for Ofcom to impact on individual companies' investment decisions. Instead, the provision is intended to ensure that, as many of your Lordships argued in Committee, when Ofcom is taking regulatory decisions it has in mind the need for investment in public service media content and networks fit for ever-increasing demands and next-generation technologies-to take up the point made by my noble friend Lord Mitchell-for the benefit of all and not just the companies involved. I have endeavoured to address those concerns and, in the light of that, I hope that noble Lords will support the amendment.</p>

The Minister was kind enough to write to me following our debate on this topic in Committee. In his letter, he confirmed that the Government's new definition of public service media content could include blogs,</p>
<ul><a name="1003014000037"></a>"to the extent that these contribute to the public service objectives set out in section 264(6)",</ul>
<p><a name="1003014000031"></a>of the Communications Act.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="1003014000016"></a>As I pointed out in previous debates, these objectives include a wide variety of topics, ranging from religious and educational topics to entertainment and comedy. As such, it could be argued that almost any website where an individual has editorial control could fall under these objectives-anything from the obvious, such as newspaper sites and political blogs, to comedy, show reviews or even online video games.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="1003014000017"></a>Is it the Government's intention that Ofcom should promote investment into almost anything on the internet? It is hard to see how this will work in practice. I am  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1226"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sure that the aim is not intended to be so broad, but it is what the definition provided in this Bill could lead to.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="1003014000018"></a>The Minister argued in his letter that we need to give Ofcom sufficient flexibility to take into account new forms of public service media content. The need to allow public service broadcasters to invest in distributing public service content in new ways, notably through the internet, is understandable. However, surely what the internet shows is that public service content online is very much alive and well. The whole point of the internet is that services spring up where there is a demand for them. Excellent work is created without Ofcom promoting investment.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="1003014000019"></a>I therefore urge the Minister to think again about whether such a duty is necessary and, more importantly, whether such a broad definition of public service media content will not make the duty so unwieldy as to become meaningless. I beg to move.</p>

Exactly like him, I seek guidance on what this section means. As the noble Lord knows, I am a strong supporter  of public service broadcasting-not just the BBC  but Channel 4, ITV and the other public service broadcasters-so there is absolutely no question of my not supporting it. What I do not understand is the duty placed on Ofcom,</p>
<ul><a name="1003014000038"></a>"to promote appropriate levels of investment in public service media content".</ul>
<p><a name="1003014000032"></a>That is what I do not understand-the promotion.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="1003014000022"></a>For once we are not talking about what is "appropriate" but about what "promote" actually means. Does it mean that it is the duty-or that it is possible or conceivable-that Ofcom could push for more public spending, so that more money could be spent in this area? If it does mean that, does it not bring it smack up against the department that is responsible for spending? In other words, there would be a divided voice. You may well find the department takes one view and Ofcom takes another. Perhaps that is not the intention. However, it is such an extraordinarily wide definition that it seems that Ofcom would be entirely entitled to take whatever view it wanted as a result of this.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="1003014000023"></a>The most useful thing that the Minister could do is to give us examples of what this section means in practice. In other words, what does promoting appropriate levels of investment in public service media content actually mean when it comes down to it? That would be very much for the convenience of the House.</p>

It will already have been recognised in our debates on the two preceding groups of amendments that the Government have listened carefully to the anxieties that have been expressed in parts of the House about this issue. We have sought to respond as constructively as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="1003014000025"></a>When we spoke about the issue in Committee, we made clear the importance of placing consideration of the need to promote investment in public service media content as one of the most important qualifiers of Ofcom's principal duty. We made it clear that paragraph (b) places a clear requirement on Ofcom always to consider the impact of its decisions on the need to invest in public service media content.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="1003014000026"></a>Public service media content aims to fulfil the specific objectives set out in the Communications Act 2003 for the benefit of the public. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, is undoubtedly an authority on that Act, and I have no doubt the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, is becoming one. Certainly, I recall that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, spent a great deal of time debating these issues when the Communications Act was eventually passed in 2003. The specific objective set out in that Act is the benefit to the public. That objective is highly valued by viewers and listeners and has clear social and economic benefits for the UK. Plurality of public service media content drives healthy competition with the BBC-I am sure that that will commend itself to the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, and to his noble friend-and with purely commercial content.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="1003014000027"></a>I emphasise that, in fulfilling this obligation, Ofcom is not taking on new powers. This is a clarification of the powers that Ofcom has under the Communications Act in circumstances where, from time to time, the changing nature of media presents real and obvious anxieties. Changes to the market in recent years threaten aspects of public service media content. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and the House committee that he chairs have drawn attention to these matters when we have debated these points in the House on the broader issue of broadcasting policy.</p>

<a name="100301-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="1003014000028"></a>We consider that Ofcom's existing duty to consider, where relevant, the desirability of promoting the fulfilment of the purposes of public service broadcasting no longer goes far enough. We risk losing plurality in certain genres of public service content. We are not seeking to make Ofcom intrusive but to see that it is placed to evaluate where it can encourage investment and where loss of plurality would be a cost to society. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, sometimes needs persuading on this point, but we are concerned to emphasise that economic benefits must include social benefits for the community in terms of access to a plurality of sources of provision. It would be detrimental to society and to the industry if we saw erosion take place in that regard, and Ofcom would have no powers to respond to it. The House will appreciate that the Bill seeks to project the discussion and the necessary provisions into the immediately foreseeable future and the more distant future. We want to see Ofcom adequately equipped to fulfil its obligations in that context. Clause 1 therefore strengthens Ofcom's existing duty under the Communications Act and makes a firm commitment to the need to promote investment in our public service media content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10030130000001"></a>A few moments ago, we sought from the government side to clarify the meaning of this clause by additional amendments, which is a reflection of the debate that  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1228"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we had in Committee. I hope, therefore, that that is regarded as progress. I emphasise that we cannot predetermine the form and delivery of public service media content in every respect in the years to come. This is obvious from the rapid changes which have arisen from digitalisation over the past decade. It is important that Clause 1 gives Ofcom sufficient flexibility to take into account new forms of public service media content provided by means of the internet, where it is appropriate to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10030130000002"></a>I emphasise-at least to allay, if I can, the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Howard; and I think that I will probably be able take the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, with me on this point, though I may be presuming too much-that Ofcom will be required to consider the need to promote investment in public service media content only when performing its principal duty as identified in the 2003 Act-and nothing in this Bill detracts from it-to further the interests of citizens and consumers as it carries out its functions. That is the context in which Ofcom will continue to act. I hope that the noble Lord will therefore feel that the Government's case is made out, against the background of the emendations that we have made by the previous government amendments, and that he can safely withdraw his amendment.</p>

On the noble Lord's suggestion that this might give rise to tensions between the department and Ofcom, I have no doubt that in an extreme case, where the issue was of such substance that Ofcom was convinced of very substantial investment being necessary, it is inconceivable that the Secretary of State and his department would not be clearly aware of such issues and would not be very much part of the public debate which had identified the nature of the threat to the public of the loss of plurality of services. It is not as if, under this Bill, Ofcom is operating in a vacuum in which wider considerations are not taken into account. In fact, as we have indicated all along, Ofcom is to take firmly into account the interests of citizens and consumers. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, would be the first to identify the fact that when we ask Ofcom to do that, we expect it to be all too well aware of the points being made by Ministers, by informed opinion in the other place, and, dare I say it, by informed opinion in this place too, of which the noble Lord's committee might be an important part.</p>

If we take it that we accept the investment need and the desirability of the investment, as explained by the Minister, it seems that in seeking to improve the width and breadth of what Ofcom can do, the Government may have gone too far. I can understand the requirement to maintain plurality, but if the Minister reads through

<a name="10030130000006"></a><b><a name="100301-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10030130000104"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, this amendment brings forward some issues that we discussed at length in Committee. There are two quite separate issues. The first reflects a debate, which the Government have dealt quite well with in their Amendment 6, on the fact that we needed to remind Ofcom of its duty to citizens and customers.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10030130000007"></a>One particular illustration of that-which struck me as we were doing research for the Committee and which I would like the Government to take account of in the first part of this amendment-is the way in which Ofcom has chosen to deal with various electronic communications service monopolies or effective monopolies. One of the fundamental purposes of Ofcom ought to be to stand up for the consumer where we, as a Government, and it, as Ofcom, have allowed effective monopolies to be created. These are monopolies like Microsoft's operating systems. I see that the European Commission has had a hand in unlinking Microsoft from Internet Explorer and letting the other browser producers have wider access to Microsoft's customers. This sort of effective monopoly comes from having taken one decision and then being bound into others, which is current in bits of the communication market.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10030130000008"></a>I give two examples. If you are a subscriber to British Telecom's voice over internet services, you will find that you are excluded from all but their own directory enquiries. You actually cannot get through to their competitors at all-the numbers are blocked-whereas we have been to considerable lengths, in other spheres, to make sure that people had equal access to all the competitors on landlines. It is time that Ofcom  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1230"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>said something about the desirability of that practice. Locking customers in to essentially uncompetitive services is something which Ofcom ought to be taking into account. Instead, it seems to be totally focused on wanting British Telecom and other voice over internet providers to be able to make substantial profits because it sees it as a young industry. I do not think that it is a young industry; it is becoming a pretty old and universal industry now. Ofcom ought to be coming back to say, "Right, you've grown up, lads. Now there is a grown-up set of rules for you to obey".</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10030130000009"></a>Even in mobile telecoms, which is a pretty mature industry, you find some strange practices in this country. Several of the operators will charge you £1.50 to access a competitive directory enquiries service, whereas in France, where the authorities have taken action, the mobile telecom operators impose a mark-up of about 15 per cent on the price charged by the directory service provider. It is something like four times as high in this country, which is due entirely to the fact that Ofcom has refused to do anything about it. It seems to me that Ofcom should be reminded that it has a real duty to the customer and that there are real problems here which it ought to be moving gently and sensibly to sort out. It is a major force and has a lot of power. It does not need legislation or litigation to deal with these problems. All it needs to do is to come out and say that it finds these practices undesirable. Over time they will go because otherwise, as I am sure the industry realises, there will be legislation or litigation to make sure it happens. However, Ofcom absolutely has to stand up for the consumer in these sort of cases.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10030130000010"></a>The second part of the amendment deals with the provision of spectrum to the emergency services. I am afraid that I have had a very unsatisfactory letter from Ministers on this. My basic case is that we know that at some stage there will be a demand for additional spectrum for the emergency services. It is not there at the moment because they do not have the budget, and they do not have the budget because budgets are being squeezed everywhere. However, it is clear that the situation in which the emergency services operate on kit whose concept is 10 to 15 years old cannot last.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10030130000011"></a>The capacity and capability of mobile telecommuni- cations have vastly increased and look set to increase further. When we come to the point-perhaps five years in the future-when we feel prosperous again and decide that the provision we make for our emergency services should be stepped up, we should have the capacity to do so. In their letter to me, the Government recognise that this is likely to be around the 1-gigahertz point in the spectrum-the bit of the spectrum which has been freed up by the digital dividend and which is being looked at in a European context for harmonisation. It is the bit of the spectrum which Ofcom is determined to sell as quickly as possible to the highest bidder. Therefore, when we reach the point when we want to do something for our emergency services, we will have to put them in another bit of the spectrum, and the kit that we have to buy for them will be a great deal more expensive because it will have to be arranged specially. There will be no opportunity, as there has been with the current system, for our industries which supply the kit to market that kit world wide.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10030130000012"></a>The current system has been a tremendous success. Taking standardisation forward for the current emergency services spectrum, we have been able to sell the kit that we produced for ourselves to a very large number of other countries. That has been a great boon to British industry, which is very much in the lead in this sector. However, the Government are refusing to recognise that. They say that they want to sell the spectrum for which they can find a commercial demand now and set nothing aside for the future emergency services spectrum. That seems to be a dangerous and muddle-headed approach. I do not think that they will have time to do it before the election, so perhaps it will be their successor who has control over this. I believe that one function of government, and therefore one function of Ofcom, ought to be to have regard to our long-term requirements as a nation regarding the spectrum that we want to use for our national security and our emergency services. Subordinating that to short-term commercial interests seems extremely foolish. I beg to move.</p>

Sometimes we forget that the utilities such as electricity and water, on which we are totally dependent, rely on telecommunications for their infrastructure and that, as sophistication increases and control systems get better, they, too, will need a larger bandwidth. If we do not start reserving this at a strategic level, it will get sold.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10030130000014"></a>The big challenge at the moment concerns the huge shortfall in finance at government level. Whichever party, or perhaps coalition, is in power after the next election, one easy way to try to raise money will be to sell a full spectrum quickly. However, this is not a vote-catching issue. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, we will wake up at some point in the future to find that, instead, we are faced with a huge expense because this spectrum, under the guise of efficiency, market forces and so on, has been sold off.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10030130000015"></a>I, too, have received letters saying that the Government's approach to this at the moment is totally inadequate. I hope that the Government will listen and include something at Third Reading or when the Bill goes through the Commons in order to protect with absolute certainty the spectrum that will be needed for international co-operation, for our emergency services and for our critical national infrastructure; otherwise, one morning we may wake up to find that there is no electricity.</p>

The more I have heard the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, expand on this amendment and the more information I have received from other sources, the keener I am to support it. The example of Microsoft being "encouraged" by Europe to open up to competition is absolutely as it should be. Those of us who live in areas with very poor broadband provision are aware of just how much competition is needed to ensure that the latest methods gain ground to the benefit of us all. However, as has  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1232"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been said, the emergency services aspect of all this is absolutely crucial. During our mini crisis with the snow and so on, a number of areas were failed by a lack of resources and a lack of megabytes. Therefore, I am very much in favour of the amendment. Together with the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, I hope that the Government will take this matter equally seriously, realise how much support there is for it and perhaps bring back an amendment of their own.</p>

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="10030130000017"></a><b><a name="100301-0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10030130000107"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> My Lords, there is a lot of sympathy from these Benches for much of the amendment. A lot of the debate about how we best equip this country for the digital economy has been focused on investment in infrastructure. Although it is important that the necessary infrastructure is in place, particularly for the next generation of broadband, what will drive demand for increased broadband speeds are the services that can be delivered. There is therefore some sense in ensuring that Ofcom gives regard to the promotion of competition in electronic communications services. I am always reluctant to add to a regulator's duties unless there is a specific problem that needs addressing, and I should be interested in hearing the Minister's view on whether this is indeed the case.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10030130000018"></a>Finally, I want to deal with the second part of the amendment regarding the emergency services and critical national infrastructure. It seems obvious that our communication networks must be able to serve those two critical areas. We must be aware of any potential problems with either the emergency services or our national infrastructure. I only ask whether Ofcom is currently equipped to do such a job. As a largely economic regulator, I wonder whether it has the necessary skills for this particular role. I look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister says.</p>

<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="10030130000019"></a><b><a name="100301-0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="10030130000108"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, this amendment is in two parts, and the first part concerns the duties of Ofcom in relation to competition and the desirability of encouraging competition. I did not quite recognise the world that was being described. I see a world where there is a lot of competition in relation to broadband services and telecoms and mobile services. Should we be complacent? No, we should not, for some of the more complicated reasons addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10030130000020"></a>However, I stress that with respect to every decision it takes, Ofcom must, where it is the appropriate means of furthering the interests of consumers, promote competition in the markets that it regulates. Furthermore, Ofcom must, in any event, consider the desirability of promoting competition in those markets. Therefore, it has an emphatic duty in that regard. Again, if one looks at the range of service providers in internet services and telecoms, both fixed network and mobile, one sees-without suggesting that we should be complacent-a wealth of evidence of real competition. In addition, Ofcom addresses anti-competitive practices and agreements. Indeed, this underpins the majority of its work. Therefore, if we have the kind of scenarios that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, described, they clearly need to be referred to Ofcom.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1233"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10030130000021"></a>It is therefore not clear just what the proposed amendment would add, and, on that basis, the Government cannot agree with it. I tend to agree-I do not always-with the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that we would not want to extend Ofcom's powers if there were not the need for it. I absolutely agree that it is about driving demand for broadband services, and that is what it has been doing pretty well.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10030130000022"></a>On the second part of the amendment, my understanding is that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is concerned to ensure that Ofcom considers the spectrum needs of the emergency services and providers of critical national infrastructure. I stress that Ofcom already has a duty under Section 3(4)(f) of the Communications Act to consider,</p>
<ul><a name="10030130000093"></a>"the different needs and interests ... of all persons",</ul>
<p><a name="10030130000023"></a>when considering spectrum use. Importantly, this includes the needs and interests of the emergency services and providers of critical national infrastructure. I understand and take the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, about the way in which our infrastructures control their own networks, so that there will be more requirement for spectrum. However, Ofcom already has a duty to consider that. As I think we made clear in a previous debate, consultation is already taking place.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10030130000024"></a>The Secretary of State will, where he considers it appropriate, use the power given to him by the Wireless Telegraphy Act to require Ofcom to make spectrum available for certain uses or users. Therefore, we consider that no amendment is needed to give effect to the intentions of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. We do not see a scenario in which Ofcom blithely goes ahead and disposes of all the spectrum in a grand sale or auction. I do not think that we will ever see quite what we saw on third generation-but who knows? However, it certainly does not have the power to do that without considering the requirements of the emergency services and critical national infrastructure.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10030130000025"></a>I can offer the noble Lord an assurance that if the emergency services have a robust case for additional spectrum which they are unable to source from the market, a process exists to address that need. Ensuring public safety-to address the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe-would be a paramount consideration in that process.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10030130000026"></a>The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 contains emergency powers to allow the making of special temporary legislation to deal with the most serious of emergencies. Such legislation could cover the temporary allocation of spectrum to the emergency services and critical national infrastructure in the event of a national emergency. However, the emergency would have to be of sufficient magnitude that serious damage to human welfare, the environment or security were threatened, existing powers are insufficient and the measures being taken are proportionate.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10030130000027"></a>I therefore feel that Ofcom's existing powers can deal with the requirements of the emergency services. It has a duty to do so. I hope that in the light of the assurances that I have placed on the record, the noble Lord will feel capable of withdrawing his amendment.</p>

I think that he has convinced me that this amendment should not go into the Bill. On the first part, I am clear that the matter is already there to his satisfaction in the current legislation, and I think that we both agree that this is merely a question of Ofcom not performing as it should the duties that it already has. So I shall continue to badger Ofcom about that. When it comes to the allocation of spectrum, there is a substantial division between us; but it is not a division for this legislation but a matter of the policy to be pursued by the Government in the long-term interest of the nation. I do not see, for all his professing the supremacy of the requirements of national security and so on, that the actions he is allowing Ofcom to take fit in with that. For now, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

My interest relates wholly and directly to the crucial issue of self-regulation or, as I would prefer to call it, regulation that is entirely independent of the state.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10030130000030"></a>My concern is to ensure that the Bill does not diminish the freedom of the press and magazine industry to publish news online that may be partial, including news where there is a person exercising editorial control over that published material. I am grateful to the Minister for taking the time to discuss this matter with me between Committee and Report.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10030130000031"></a>The issue is a thorny one. I accept without reservation that, where news is disseminated by what can be clearly defined as public service broadcasting, the provision of that news must be subject to the usual rules of impartiality. What is not clear in the Bill is the situation with regard to newspaper and magazine websites, which are not regulated by Ofcom and are not subject to any rules or codes of impartiality. They are regulated by the Press Complaints Commission, which, of course, is a body that itself is not regulated by statute and is independent both of the newspaper industry and of the state. I am concerned that the proposed amendment to the Communications Act in Clause 1(5)(c) appears to give Ofcom new powers to regulate newspaper and magazine websites. I appreciate that Ofcom has given clarification and guidance notes that this will not be its intention, but clearly, if that is not incorporated into primary legislation, theoretically at least the power will exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10030130000032"></a>As I am sure the Minister is aware, the audiovisual media services directive recital states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="10030130000084"></a>"The scope of this directive should not cover electronic versions of newspapers and magazines".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10030130000033"></a>I am concerned that the exemption of newspaper and magazine websites, explicitly mentioned in the AVMS directive, has still not been incorporated into English law, either in the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2009 or, thus far, by the Bill as currently drafted, and that the audiovisual material on the websites of magazines and business publishers may be caught by the regulations despite this not being the intention of the directive. It is important to note that the Press Complaints Commission remit covers editorial material on newspaper and magazine websites where it meets two key requirements: that the editor of the newspaper or magazine is responsible for it and could reasonably have been expected both to exercise editorial control over it and apply the terms of the code; and that it was not pre-edited to conform to the online or offline standard of any other media regulatory body.</p>

<a name="100301-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10030130000034"></a>In effect, if the material is not sourced from broadcasters, such as the BBC or ITN, but is original to the paper, it is covered by the Press Complaints Commission, not by Ofcom. In moving this amendment, I am therefore respectfully asking the Government to make it clear that the Bill's extensions of Ofcom's general duties will not give Ofcom any new powers over any content, including audiovisual content, on newspaper and magazine websites. I beg to move.</p>

My noble friend Lady Buscombe has, with her usual laser-like precision, tackled one problematic aspect of the Bill's definition of public service media content-namely, that it will mean that Ofcom has a duty to promote investment in newspaper and magazine websites. At the moment the newspaper industry has its own regulator, the Press Complaints Commission, chaired so ably by the noble Baroness. It would not be wise to extend Ofcom's remit into this realm. I am not sure that the sector would appreciate Ofcom having a specific duty to promote investment into it. As the noble Baroness has made these points far better than I will be able to do, I will simply congratulate her on bringing forward the amendment and hope that the Minister listens carefully.</p>

Is the noble Baroness suggesting that, in the event that broadcast material that had been turned down or not used by the public service broadcasters because of its content became available, a newspaper or magazine could put it on its website as broadcast material, avoid any sanctions that Ofcom could bring and fall under the PCC only? If that is the case, the PCC is giving itself an enormous new problem. The other day, the noble Baroness was very eloquent about a particularly difficult situation that she felt did not quite cross the line. I suggest that a great deal of material will start crossing the line. I want to be clear about what is broadcast and what is material that would normally be expected to come from a newspaper or magazine.</p>

It is not clear to me where old terms such as "newspaper" and "magazine" belong in the modern world. Many of the magazines that I read have no physical existence. Page-turning technology means that you now get something that feels very like a magazine. You can browse it and enjoy it very much as you do a paper magazine. New sources are developing outside the newspaper industry and, the more the newspaper industry tries to make life difficult for its customers, the more these sources will flourish. Where do the Government see the boundary between the part of the media world that has to have balance and the rest of it that does not?

I think that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is asking me to define in a few succinct phrases over the course of an hour and half the purposes of this section of the Bill. I shall resist such blandishments and opportunities because noble Lords who contributed to this debate will recognise that I am concerned to allay the anxieties that the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, voiced when we discussed these issues in Committee. When we subsequently met to clarify them, she spoke on behalf of the Press Complaints Commission to express its anxieties. That is a significant enough body for me to address it formally to give the assurances that I can give. I hope that I will obtain the withdrawal of this amendment, despite the fact that my reply will fall somewhat short of the expectations, and even perhaps the hopes, of my noble friend Lord Puttnam. It will certainly fall short of the expectations of my noble friend Lord Maxton and, by a country mile, of the hopes of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I shall not go over this ground again, nor will I engage in the kind of debate where, if we were not careful, we could be here for many a long hour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10030130000040"></a>In her amendment, the noble Baroness makes it clear that she is concerned that Clause 1 grants Ofcom new powers to regulate newspaper websites. I reassure her that Clause 1 does not grant Ofcom any powers to regulate newspaper websites, including audiovisual content. I should also make it clear that the definition of "media services" in subsection (5) covers newspaper websites. As ever with government Bills, this is quite deliberate and constructive. It may benefit newspaper websites to the extent that, in carrying out its functions, Ofcom will be required under Clause 1 to have regard to the need to promote investment in content included in newspaper websites that contributes or may contribute to the public service objectives at the heart of the obligation on Ofcom. Ofcom has advised us that such

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10030130000041"></a>I want to emphasise an additional point. The AVMS regulations 2009 require Ofcom to regulate on-demand programme services. The regulations define an on-demand programme service as having as its principal purpose the provision of programmes of form and content comparable to programmes normally included in television programme services. The principal purpose of newspaper websites is not to provide on-demand programme services, even where they currently provide some audiovisual content. It is theoretically possible that newspaper websites could provide such on-demand programme services in future. In such a case, the regulations would not-I emphasise this again, as it is the main cause of the anxiety of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe-require Ofcom to regulate the entire newspaper website, just the on-demand service that it is obliged to regulate.</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10030130000042"></a>That is the response to the amendment. There may be-I hope not-occasions on later amendments when I can deliberate a little further as I have been invited to do on this amendment, but this amendment was tabled with the specific objective in mind that we should clarify the matter. I have sought to do so and I hope that noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

Perhaps I can remind noble Lords that, as this is Report, it was not within my power to respond to questions. The Minister responded in a way that is helpful to my amendment. We have to allow for some pragmatism because the focus of the amendment is the question mark over new forms of public service media content. There is a need to differentiate the regulation of the websites of the press and the magazine industry and the regulation of a situation where there is public service media content. As the Minister suggested, there may be rare instances where that may include content that originated from newspapers and is specifically aimed at or provided for public service broadcast. I thank the Minister for taking the time to cover this crucial issue and to give me a helpful reply. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The objective of this amendment is to try to strengthen the Government's hand in what they put through in Amendments 2 and 3, effectively, which is to put a duty on Ofcom to sort out a particular part of communications infrastructure which unfortunately has heavy underinvestment. The challenge that this amendment seeks to address is the lack of investment in maintaining the local loop, which is the part from the exchange to the customer, when it falls outside areas of high population density: in other words, rural areas and bits of towns which are not covered particularly well.</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10030130000045"></a>The problem arises because Openreach is a separate company but is also a subsidiary of BT, and it is responsible for the repairs and maintenance of this part of the infrastructure. Unfortunately, it suffers from severe financial constraints, not all of which are operational. For instance, there is a huge pension deficit in BT, which means that it has had to cut back on maintenance to a bare minimum. The trouble is that the average non-technical customer has real problems in continuing to receive the service for which they originally contracted their ISP. The ISPs have problems delivering it because they are finding that the lines are degrading. I have noticed that, the more I have said this in other fora, the more people join in and say, "Exactly; my line is getting worse and worse".</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10030130000046"></a>Let us say that you have got a fault on a line which has not been unbundled: in other words, it is still in BT's ownership. You are paying BT Retail for the line, and you are paying an ISP to provide you with broadband over that line. It gets a service from BT Wholesale, which runs what is called the backhaul from the exchange onto the main internet. Openreach is responsible for maintaining and fixing any faults on the line. There are four service entities involved, and there may be more. There are Chinese walls between these, and there is a lot of buck-passing. Let us say that your broadband is not working. You are meant to ring up  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1239"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1239</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>your ISP, and tell it so. It is then allowed to test the line, and it may well use BT Retail stuff to do that, or it may be Openreach. Do not hold me to the exact detail of who owns which bit. BT Retail's universal service obligation only covers voice over copper, not the maintenance of broadband connections. So it will probably pass that test, but it is still not adequate for broadband, so it comes back and reports that the line is not faulty, but you know, empirically, that it is.</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10030130000047"></a>What do you do next? This is a challenge, because you cannot talk to BT Wholesale. The other thing that could be happening is that either BT Wholesale, or your ISP, could be throttling back your internet connection and reducing the speed on it because it has a lot of traffic, or they could be doing what they call traffic shaping, which is allowing only certain types of traffic through at full speed. This is done through a digital line management unit, which is connected to your digital subscriber line access management unit in the exchange. These are technical things, but they will not tell you if they are doing them. There is no way of finding out, so you are stuck. I have discovered, because my line fell to under half its speed over a four-year period, that, when this sort of thing happens, if you can pester people persistently over a six-month period, and you know something about it, and eventually your line fails completely, there are some excellent engineers at Openreach who can and will come and sort it out. My line is now nearly treble the speed it was a couple of months ago, so they can do it. There is not a real problem with the lines. The trouble is the underinvestment.</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10030130000048"></a>Amendment 9A has a couple of main points. The proposed new subsections 2(a) and 2(b) are supposed to deal with the problem of buck-passing, so that somebody is responsible for sorting out your fault. The next bit addresses the part of the problem whereby, because of the underinvestment and the fact that they are kept on a very short rein, whenever they come to repair your line, they will do the minimum possible to get it working to the minimum standard possible, because there is not much money. Therefore, they could be upgrading these lines when they replace stretches of line. They could be putting in 0.9mm copper instead of 0.5mm: but no, it will go in at 0.5mm, which tends to be universal. With broadband, we want to get better stuff in there, but they will not do that because it costs more money. That is why, under proposed new subsections 2(c) and 2(d), repairs would not be done at the bare minimum. Where possible, they should try to increase the capacity of those lines and improve them, and use that opportunity to steadily improve the network in distant rural points. This is supposed to be positive, and it would give Ofcom powers to put something together that might manage some of the problem. This will also require some co-operation and some financial sorting out, and some other things, but maybe it is a start. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1240"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is exactly what Ofcom should be doing to allay the frustrations of consumers of broadband services, exactly in the way that the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, described. Many broadband users will have had exactly that experience, where you try to fix someone in this whole chain with responsibility, and wholly fail to do so. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic, but even if he is not, I hope that Ofcom, when it gets a chance to read this debate, will know and understand some of the frustrations. This is not exceptional. This kind of example is very much a day-to-day situation.</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10030130000051"></a>I will not reply to the technical nature of the contribution made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, because I do not think that would be an appropriate use of time. I understand the points that he made, having worked at some time in my life on some of that network. I want to address the underlying concern. Communications providers are required by Ofcom to establish procedures for handling complaints from consumers where they feel that they are not receiving adequate service. Failure to implement an adequate complaints procedure is actionable by Ofcom. I understand the point made by the noble Earl. It can be difficult for ordinary consumers to try to pinpoint where the blame lies and to get the appropriate action taken, but if it is not being handled correctly by the service providers, and if they have not got an adequate complaints procedure, that is actionable by Ofcom.</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10030130000052"></a>If the complaint cannot be resolved within the consumer complaint procedures, consumers are able to file an application with two independent alternative dispute resolution schemes. These are Otelo and CISAS, and do not ask me to explain those acronyms. These schemes can investigate the circumstances of a complaint and make a judgment that is binding on the provider, but not the consumer, who is always free to pursue separate legal action should satisfactory resolution not be possible.</p>

<a name="100301-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10030130000053"></a>Ofcom has also taken steps to promote competition and improve the incentives of providers to invest in and maintain broadband infrastructure, including by creating a competitive environment that allows investors who see a case for investing in networks to do so, and ensuring that consumers can make informed choices regarding services and providers, including publishing research on broadband speeds, which was one of the major concerns expressed by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll. The incentives provided by competition should help to eliminate poor service levels for consumers since they will be free, subject to any minimum  contract term, to move to another provider offering higher levels of service. The UK has a healthy market for broadband provision, with a wide range of providers offering retail services. Complaints about the absence of supply were the reason for the Government's universal service commitment, which aims to deliver a minimum level of service at 2 megabits per second to virtually every community in the UK by 2012, including rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10030130000054"></a>The amendment asks Ofcom to establish a scheme to deal with complaints, faults and requests regarding broadband and its associated data- and signal-carrying cables. Whatever the problems, getting Ofcom to handle this cannot be the right way. It would not even be the direct service provider. This would be a good example of extending the powers of Ofcom in a direction which would not solve the problem. There are some problems, and I understand the points which the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, are making, but this is not the right solution. As I say, there are already facilities for consumers who want to complain, and Ofcom already has the power to take action if the complaints procedure is not adequate. In the light of that explanation, I urge the noble Earl to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I just hope that the Government will think about this matter a little harder before it goes to another place, because something should be put into the Bill. Yes, you can complain to Otelo or CISAS about BT Retail or your ISP, who are your communication service providers, but the challenge is that you cannot talk to the very people who are responsible for doing something about it, who are Openreach or BT Wholesale. There is a complete disconnection between the two because of the Chinese walls that were set up for competitive reasons: to try to prevent BT from looking after its own. Unfortunately, the structure that has been set up does not work, and it will take someone else from outside-Ofcom is the only organisation that can do this-to realign the way in which the two work together. At that point, it should be able to stand back again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10030130000056"></a>What is happening at the moment is not working. It is too easy for people to pass the buck to each other. If you complain to Otelo or CISAS, BT Retail will say simply that it has done all that it can, and Otelo or CISAS will have to agree that it has. I am afraid that there is a problem here that needs to be addressed, and it would be nice if the Minister could think about this and if the Government could do something about it. My amendment in essence seeks to push things in the right direction. I probably should have tabled it at an earlier stage, but had not thought about the matter hard enough. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10030130000058"></a>I have no doubt that these reports will be vital in assisting the Secretary of State in determining priorities for communications policies. There is no doubt that Ofcom is the body that should carry out such an assessment at arm's length from Ministers. However, I do not understand why the Minister's hands need to be tied by stipulating how often these reports are produced. The Secretary of State is missing a trick  if he insists on defining the regularity of these reports so rigidly.</p>

The noble Lords, Lord Razzall and Lord Clement-Jones, suggested that four years would be more appropriate, and, during the robust debate that followed, the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, very helpfully suggested a compromise position of three years as being more "appropriate and reasonable".

If a Secretary of State gets to the point where he feels that he needs a report on the condition of the communications infrastructure because of particular concerns, presumably there is something to worry about and it is already too late to take action to head off that concern.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10030130000068"></a>Regular reports will ensure that Ministers have good, regular and consistent information that enables them to be well placed to take policy decisions that will place the UK at the top of the league table on communications infrastructure, instead of having to struggle to catch up, as we did with first-generation broadband and are in danger of having to do with high-speed broadband.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10030130000069"></a>Finally, I reassure your Lordships that Ofcom will still be required to alert the Secretary of State to any significant developments in the sector that are likely to have a significant adverse impact on businesses or on the general public in between reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10030130000070"></a>In Committee, the noble Lords, Lord Lucas and Lord Whitty, expressed a strong view, which was supported by others, that the reports that are prepared by Ofcom on the infrastructure and domain names and sent to the Secretary of State should be published. Our policy intention has always been that those reports will be published as soon as possible. Having considered the points that were made in Committee, we have concluded that for clarity it would be helpful to table a government amendment that requires the infrastructure reports in new Section 134A and the reports on internet domain names in new Section 134C of the Communications Act 2003 to be published by Ofcom.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10030130000071"></a>As noble Lords will no doubt understand, commercially confidential information or information that should not be disclosed for other legitimate reasons-for example, law enforcement or personal privacy-should not be published. We therefore propose that Ofcom should not have to publish any material that would justifiably be withheld under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

This part of the Bill deals with Ofcom's responsibility for spreading infrastructure, in the areas for which it is the regulator, across the whole of the nation. Whatever form of infrastructure we are talking about, it is common experience in rural areas of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that the consumers, citizens and businesses that are located there have worse access, lower speeds in relation  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1245"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to broadband, more intermittency and generally a worse service than in urban and suburban areas. This applies not just to the remotest areas of Scotland, but also-I declare an interest in terms of my home address-in the borders of Dorset and Wiltshire. It is clear that if we are requiring Ofcom to report on progress in installing infrastructure in general, as this clause does, then the way in which we judge whether Ofcom has been successful-or Ofcom has judged the industry to be successful-must pay particular attention to the effect in rural areas.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10030138000002"></a>In Committee, I was told that there was no need to spell out all the different potentially disadvantaged groups that Ofcom had to have regard to because that was written in Ofcom's basic constitution. I sort of accept that. I was also told there was no need to require Ofcom to report separately to the devolved Administrations, so that they can tackle problems that may arise in their particular areas, because Ofcom always does that. However, this is a specific and new reporting requirement. It is one required by this Bill and it is one to which reference was made in the first debate today on the new clause on Ofcom's responsibilities in relation to infrastructure. Whether you are talking about the changes in the effective operation of your mobile phone as you drive through the rural lanes of our country, whether you are talking about the speed of broadband or whether, equally importantly, you are talking about the ability to access public services and other information in rural areas digitally, then it is an important dimension of Ofcom fulfilling this responsibility that its reporting system should very specifically and very clearly cover the interests of rural consumers.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10030138000003"></a>I am perfectly prepared to concede that the Government might have a better form of wording here. If anything, there probably should be a stronger form of wording. However, specific reference in the Bill to the rural areas in respect of this reporting mechanism is important. As distinct from one or two of my amendments later on, it ought to be a relatively easy amendment for the Government to accept. I beg to move.</p>

I know the Minister addressed it briefly at the Committee stage so I went back and looked again at what has actually happened in a number of rural areas. People living in rural areas are not just another group. Because of the Government's quite correct drive to get more services online, it has become essential for those people to be able to access those online services, some of which time out if things take too long because they have only a dial-up mechanism. The same applies to online banking. With banks and other outlets such as post offices closing, online access becomes ever more important.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10030138000005"></a>The Minister may say that other agencies-for example, the regional development agencies-should have been responsible. Indeed, in many cases they did take forward investment effectively. However, that has been patchy. It has not been equal across the regions. Economic and social development are being very adversely affected  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1246"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and this is the least the Government can do to rectify the situation. A long time ago-in fact when the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was Defra Minister in this House-there was much talk of rural-proofing. This would be one of the main things the Government could do to rural-proof. Perhaps the Government still do a check on their Bills to make sure that they are rural-proofed. I should be interested to know whether this one has been. If it has, the Government should immediately accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="10030138000006"></a><b><a name="100301-0009.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10030138000041"></a>The Earl of Erroll:</b> My Lords, this is an opportunity for the Government to indulge in a bit of joined-up strategic thinking. The challenge comes because these universal service obligations, or measures of service, are always population-based, so that it skews it immediately towards the high density areas, such as cities with high-rise blocks. If we do not create the infrastructure out in remote areas, people will be forced to move. As happened in various other preceding great revolutions, such as the industrial revolution, you will see a steady migration of population to where they will have to move to in order to take part in modern society. What you could end up doing is creating more deprived areas. This sounds terrible, as if I am predicting apocalyptic things. I am not trying to do that. However, you will see a general deprivation starting to occur. People will then worry about that and want to address it, and suddenly you will have to put in much more investment and much more money. These things have a knock-on effect-once a few people start to migrate, there is less justification for the infrastructure; then more people migrate, and suddenly it becomes untenable to live there, except for very elderly or very young people who perhaps do not need access.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10030138000007"></a>It could also be used for positive moves, such as trying strategically to repopulate the Highlands. Farming was never going to repopulate the Highlands, and trying to keep a few people there crofting certainly never did. You could have viable communities up there, but there is no way you could justify putting the infrastructure in if it was on a population-based system. So it may be worth forcing Ofcom to report in a more strategic way, looking at how we use land and resources effectively in the UK.</p>

Let us be clear: there is a difference between a remote area, where only a handful of people may live, and a rural area, which could be a village in the middle of Oxfordshire, for example and have a population of 1,000 or 1,500. There may be sufficient demand in that area to ensure the exchange is upgraded to take broadband, even though it may still be down a copper wire. There is already a scheme in Scotland. It is having problems in extending out to the remoter areas of the Highlands and Islands, but it does go out to what one would term the "rural areas" of Scotland.</p>

However, as I said in Committee, the amendment is unnecessary because the Communications Act 2003, taken with the provisions in this Bill, already require Ofcom to do just that.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10030138000011"></a>In precise terms, the objective of the amendment is already achieved by Section 3(4)(l) of the Communications Act 2003, which requires Ofcom to have regard, when relevant, to the different interests of persons living in rural-I stress that-as well as in urban areas. When that is read together with new Clause 134B(1)(b), which requires the report to cover,</p>
<ul><a name="10030138000035"></a>"the geographic coverage of the different UK networks",</ul>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10030138000012"></a>The clause talks of "geographic coverage" because there are sometimes circumstances where coverage may be problematic even in more urban areas, but as I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, are well aware, the vast majority of areas where coverage of communications networks is an issue will be rural areas-or in some cases, as my noble friend Lord Maxton reminded us, it might be even more difficult for some of the more remote areas. That is precisely what paragraph (b) is intended to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10030138000013"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, I say that we should remember that we are talking not just about the reports of Ofcom. I remind noble Lords that our report on <I>Digital Britain</I> made a specific commitment to ensure that all areas, including rural areas, have access to broadband of at least of 2 megabytes per second by 2012. That is not the end of the problems of universal broadband service, but it is a commitment to ensure a basic standard for everybody. If only we could ensure that providers delivered that, it would please the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, if no one else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10030138000014"></a>In response to the concern expressed by my noble friend Lord Whitty and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I say that the commitment is already in existing legislation, coupled with the new requirements. It is amply demonstrated also in our commitment to ensuring a universal broadband service. In the light of that, I hope that my noble friend will feel capable of withdrawing his amendment.</p>

I should declare an interest as a member of the Climate Change Adaptation Sub-Committee. I apologise for raising this issue only on Report. Discussions with Ofcom and the department have been ongoing. I am grateful to the Minister's department for its engagement, but, having reached a point of impasse, I felt that I needed to bring forward the amendment.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10030138000019"></a>Climate change will have an increasing impact on essential services in this country. Communication networks and services such as telecoms, the internet and broadcast media will be no exception. Perhaps I may give some examples: heat, floods and storms can knock out services, as can interruptions to power supplies. Transmission equipment can be jeopardised by stormy weather. In emergencies, communication services are vital not only for emergency response but for the public to gain information about what is happening during an emergency, as well as for the public to communicate with one another to gain reassurance about the safety and welfare of family and friends. During the Carlisle floods in 2005, when storms had brought down telecommunications and floods were increasing, Environment Agency staff nobly waded in and out of the local police station, itself underwater, simply in order to keep communications open and the emergency response services in action.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10030142000001"></a>Just at the time when emergencies do arise, the public want to get more information about these emergencies in order to be able to respond to them. They also want to be able to communicate with their nearest and dearest, with their places of work and with emergency services. I believe that the public have a right to expect that the communications infrastructure and services will be planned to take proper account of the medium-term and longer-term implications of climate change and that communications companies should report from time to time on their preparedness for and resilience to climate change. My Amendments 14A and 14B seek to ensure that the communications companies do so.</p>

<a name="100301-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10030142000002"></a>This is not an off-the-wall, unusual request to the communications companies. Those of your Lordships who helped to steer through the Climate Change Act will recall that, under that Act, a variety of public and business bodies-for example, the water companies and the energy companies-are required to report on their preparedness and their adaptation to the impact of climate change. The communications companies

The water companies, the energy companies and others classed as statutory undertakers are required to report. Of course the communications companies do not fall into the category of statutory undertakers, but they are, as I am sure your Lordships would agree, just as important to this country's resilience to the impact of climate change.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10030142000003"></a>Amendment 14A tries to correct what I believe is the erroneous omission of the communications companies from the Climate Change Act reporting requirement by asking Ofcom to seek reports from such companies, whose resilience to floods, heatwaves and storms is important. The Secretary of State will prescribe what information he needs to know, so Ofcom is not required to become an expert in climate change impacts and their adaptation. The proposal would not cover all the companies regulated by Ofcom but would leave Ofcom to judge which companies are the most important in terms of resilience to climate change impact.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10030142000004"></a>Amendment 14B would enable Ofcom to use its existing information-gathering powers to require communications providers to supply the information required and would ensure that Ofcom could not just ask willy-nilly for excessive information. It makes it clear that the power would be subject to the restrictions in Section 132 of the Communications Act 2003, which says that demands for information must be proportionate.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10030142000005"></a>I am absolutely certain that the Minister will resist this amendment, although I do not believe that that is because the Government do not want communications companies to have to report on whether they are resilient in the face of climate change. I believe that the Government want that; indeed, in response to the consultation about Ofcom's powers, they confirmed that they believed that the industry should plan for the resilience challenges posed by climate change. The disagreement is really about how that can be achieved. In the discussions that have been taking place, the Government have proposed that these issues be addressed later, in the wider context of the new security and resilience requirements that arise as a result of the recent review of the EU telecoms framework legislation. The revision to this framework directive has only just been published. The timescale for transposition is unclear and, although I would hesitate to accuse the Government of fiddling while the UK floods, it feels a bit like that.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10030142000006"></a>The Minister has meanwhile proposed a voluntary arrangement of the key players in the sector, which might be in place by the autumn. I believe that this is too important an issue to be left to a voluntary agreement with the industry to provide some unspecified information from unknown companies at some possible future date. Wisely, the Government have not accepted a voluntary approach with other key industries, so I do not believe that they should accept it with the electronic communications industry, which is vital to emergency resilience and the work of other parts of the critical national infrastructure.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10030142000007"></a>This may be the wrong amendment. If it is, there are perhaps other ways in which the Government can give assurance on these points. Clause 2 of this Bill,  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1251"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which amends the Communications Act 2003, requires Ofcom to prepare reports on electronic communications networks and services matters, including preparations made by providers for responding to an emergency, the steps taken to assess the risks of different types of emergency and the steps taken to reduce those risks. Perhaps the Government might give guidance to Ofcom to ensure that the definition of an emergency includes not just immediate emergencies and resilience envisaged by the clause, but also the very likely medium-term causes of future emergencies such as the impacts of climate change. It should also include the risk assessment and resilience measures to be put in place by the communications networks and services to meet not just these immediate risks but the medium-term and longer-term climate change impacts. That piece of guidance to Ofcom might strengthen the position.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10030142000008"></a>The ideal situation would be if the Government were to ponder on this amendment and bring forward one of their own, either at a later stage in this House or in another place. At the very minimum I ask the Minister to give assurances to noble Lords, and indeed to the public, that these vital communications companies will ensure that they are resilient to the impacts of climate change and that they will be required to report on that resilience, as the majority of other organisations and companies important to national climate change adaptation and resilience already have to do by law. I beg to move.</p>

Indeed, it would be very strange if we did not support the amendments from these Benches. The noble Baroness has clearly spotted a gap in the Climate Change Act, which could be filled by this amendment. The Government are suggesting a voluntary agreement; I am not quite sure why-it is not entirely clear-but I urge them to take seriously what the noble Baroness, with all her experience in this area, is putting forward. These seem to be sensible suggestions and I very much hope that the Government will look seriously at either accepting the amendments or giving them further consideration as the Bill progresses.</p>

The report pointed out many of the gaps. The Minister said in his letter that those were largely organisational gaps, but when I went back to the report I saw that the issue is a bit more far-reaching than that. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, for raising this issue, because I am little bit shocked that, as we worked our way through the Climate Change Bill in this House, we did not question the role of communications networks. It seems that, of all the statutory undertakers, those in charge of communications are right at the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10030142000011"></a>I, too, hope that the Government will be able to do more than say that they will put this back until they have something to transpose from the directive, because between now and then there are likely to be, on the

Nobody has better experience of these things, I would suggest, than the noble Baroness, who was of course in charge of the Environment Agency as the water was rising up towards that electricity substation. She has particular experience of exactly how fast these things can happen.</p>

It was clearly a fault of those who were scrutinising the Climate Change Bill that this issue was not included. Communications are absolutely vital not only in responding to the acute situation of an emergency caused by changes in weather conditions but in future-proofing the systems in terms of expected changes in temperature, soil composition as a result and so on. I hope that, even if the Minister does not completely accept the amendment moved by the noble Baroness-I nearly said "noble friend", as she was once-the Government will accept that Ofcom should take on an equivalent function to the ones that Ofwat and Ofgem have in planning for resilience in the face of climate change. Whether or not that is done in this precise form, an indication from the Government tonight would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10030142000014"></a>I am grateful to other noble Lords who have participated in the debate for stressing the importance of resilience in the telecoms network. The Government regard resilience to the risks caused by climate change as being of the utmost importance. That is why the Bill introduces a requirement for Ofcom to provide a triennial report to the Secretary of State on electronic communication infrastructure and its resilience. That refers to overall resilience, but we are concerned about a high level of resilience for the UK telecoms networks. Climate change is, of course, significant, but we also need resilience to risks such as loss of infrastructure through malicious or terrorist attack, human error, accident, force majeure or whatever. By its very nature, that will include natural events or disasters, whether or not they are caused by climate change.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10030142000015"></a>The noble Baroness, with her vast experience in her role in the Environment Agency, will know only too well that the Government have already acted on the issue of resilience. Following the Pitt review on flooding, a voluntary industry work programme to enhance resilience was put in place. That work has been going on for a considerable time. As she also knows, we also have the Flood and Water Management Bill, which we will have the greatest pleasure in debating in Committee in a couple of weeks-indeed, I gave an assurance at Second Reading that we would be considering these matters in some detail.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1253"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10030142000016"></a>The necessary resilience of our telecoms network is of great importance. Far from the Government being obstructive, we are greatly exercised, not just through the promptings of the noble Baroness but because of the views of others who are concerned about climate change. We are concerned about resilience and we are taking action.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10030142000017"></a>It is important to consider resilience as widely as possible. I do not want to risk detracting from all the existing work to enhance resilience to other risks by introducing different sets of reporting requirements on different risks. At this late stage it would also be unwise to include further onerous blanket requirements across the entire sector when we have not consulted it on that. There is a requirement on Ofcom to report on and play its part in guaranteeing effective overall resilience to any threat to our system. In the report to Parliament, <I>Adapting to Climate Change: Ensuring Progress in Key Sectors-2009 Strategy for Exercising Adaptation Reporting Power and List of Priority Reporting Authorities</I>, published in November 2009, the Government committed themselves to engaging with industry on climate change adaptation. Discussions have been taking place with Ofcom on how to achieve a voluntary way forward on reporting on climate change adaptation matters.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10030142000018"></a>Once we have a clear view on the impacts of climate change on the telecoms sector, we can explore with Ofcom how this can be incorporated within its triennial reports on resilience, to which I referred a few moments ago. Ultimately, should the impacts of climate change present a risk to the telecoms networks, reporting requirements on overall resilience are bound to reflect this, alongside all other risks that are of great moment. Creating a separate reporting requirement is not the most effective way of getting the industry to play its full part in mitigating the risks and tackling the problems.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10030142000019"></a>We know that the telecoms sector takes resilience extremely seriously. After all, it is in its interests to ensure resilience to challenges that climate change may present in the same way as it does in relation to other risks. Providers voluntarily offer high levels of resilience through an all-hazards approach that is achieved through ongoing dialogue and close co-operation. This reporting requirement would undermine that overall approach that the House will appreciate we need. There are no data available demonstrating how the telecoms sector is at risk from climate change. To mitigate vulnerability we need further discussion and analysis with the industry, taking data into consideration. To create a new legislative reporting requirement would run counter to the light-touch legislation by which the sector is currently regulated. It would at the same time detract from the comprehensive approach to risk that it is in the industry's interests to address and which the Government are pursuing vigorously.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10030142000020"></a>I make the obvious point that, if the Committee on Climate Change wants to pursue these issues further in detail, of course the Government will respond constructively, but a comprehensive approach on resilience is necessary. I have said how the Government and the industry respond when a potential threat occurs. We have already seen that in the context of the response to the floods since 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10030142000021"></a>Although this Bill is largely the concern of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which has real concerns about how regulation is enforced and developed with the industry, and although the DCMS inevitably has a great interest in many aspects of the Bill, I emphasise to the noble Baroness-I speak as one of the team of Defra Ministers-that the Secretary of State has taken a particular interest in this issue. He is all too well seized of the importance of climate change in relation to the telecoms industry, but it is not his view, nor the view of Defra as a whole, that this amendment and this specific form of reporting is necessary or desirable.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10030142000022"></a>I therefore hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment. She has certainly presented an important case, but I hope that she will accept the assurances that the Government take the case seriously and are already addressing these issues, albeit in a different way from the one that the amendment enjoins. We believe that the amendment would somewhat frustrate the total picture that the Government are seeking to establish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10030142000024"></a>I am glad that the Minister has indicated that the Government are taking this issue seriously, because it is a serious issue. However, I am a bit bemused by the idea that somehow requiring the communications companies to report would undermine the general approach that the Government are taking. It may undermine the general approach that the Government are taking to the regulation of the communications sector, but it seems to me that it would bring the communications sector entirely into line with the requirement by law to report on climate change adaptation that has been laid on all the other sectors that are important in national resilience. That does not therefore seem to me to be a killer blow to the amendment. If it is sauce for all the other geese, why is it not sauce for this particular gander?</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10030142000025"></a>Waiting for a clearer view on what the climate change impacts on the communications industries might be before deciding what to include in the triennial reports is probably a longer process than is necessary. As I said, all other sectors are required to report without the work on impacts necessarily having been gone through in detail. The whole point is to get the sectors to think for themselves about the impact of climate change on the resilience of their businesses and their services to the public and to get them to report back on their risk assessments and what they are doing about them. Spoon-feeding the communications industry in this respect seems to be out of line with the requirements that are laid on all the other sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10030150000003"></a>Unfortunately, there have sprung up what I would describe as abuses. They may not technically be abuses, but they are certainly abuses of current practice so far as the citizens subject to them are concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10030150000004"></a>The game works roughly like this. You find an owner of an obscure bit of copyright that is available on the internet, preferably something pornographic and extremely nasty. You then employ a piece of software whose innards have never been exposed to the public, or tested in a court, to produce allegations that a particular set of IP addresses have made that copyright material available for upload over the internet. You then take tens of thousand of these cases to court and, using a Norwich Pharmacal order, obtain the details of the relevant subscribers from their internet service providers. You then write them a letter, which has basically three elements to it. First, it says: "You have committed this transgression of copyright". Secondly, it says: "If you force us to take you to court, we will pursue you for a very large sum of money". Thirdly, it says: "But we offer you this opportunity to settle for a mere £500 or £800"-or whatever the figure is-"and

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10030150000005"></a>This scam works because of the impossibility of producing proof against this allegation. How can you prove that you did not do this thing? You have an internet connection, and they say that it was done over that internet connection. It is no good producing your computer, because you committed the offence using a different computer. It is no good saying that you are a 97 year-old widow and that you hardly know how to use the telephone, let alone the internet, because, nevertheless, you have an internet connection and they say that it was abused. It is extremely difficult to produce evidence to gainsay this. All you can do is deny it, and one of the things that they say in the letter is, "Don't bother to deny this without producing evidence that you didn't do it".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10030150000006"></a>The result is that a very large people of number pay up, as a result either of the first letter or of the letters that follow. As far as I can discover, despite the tens of thousands of orders that have been granted, the solicitors involved have never taken a seriously contested case to court, because getting money out of people on the basis of the compromise offer is actually what is lucrative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10030150000007"></a>There may or may not be truth at the root of this, but this is a route for obtaining redress for copyright abuse which has been neglected, and with good reason, by the reputable end of the copyright industry. It produces a great deal of distress and indignation among many thousands of our citizens, and it ought not to be allowed to continue now that we are producing a better and proper route for redress for copyright owners, particularly where we are looking at volume cases-where we are looking at large volumes of infringement. That is exactly what the Bill aims to deal with.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10030150000008"></a>My Amendments 15 and 31 look at a couple of possible ways of dealing with this. We could act on the internet service providers and give them a defence against revealing the details of their subscribers-we could say that either they or a court must be satisfied that a fair and accurate process was being used-or we could give the court the power to say, "No, here is this Act which provides a proper remedy for copyright owners who are suffering from the sort of abuse which is alleged in these letters. Let them use that route because that is fairer for consumers and a fairer basis on which to operate, which is what Parliament has decided, and lay off the techniques which are being used to extract money at present".</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10030150000009"></a>Mostly, to date, one firm has been involved, but now a second firm is getting involved. The news of how lucrative this is has spread. If we do not do something about it, we will have more firms creeping into this business. There is plenty of copyright in unpleasant material. There are plenty of opportunities for these firms to make money. It is high time that we do something effective to put a stop to it. I do not mind which of the amendments the Government choose. I suspect that if I was forced to choose between them, I would choose the one put forward by the Liberal

There are many ways to skin a cat. Our amendment is aimed at solving the problem to which the noble Lord referred. In Committee, we discussed this matter. From the letters that noble Lords on all sides of the House have received, it is apparent that there is a problem with the activities of one particular law firm. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, we think that now two law firms are involved. I am very grateful to <I>Which?</I> for drawing to our attention, apart from the letters that we have received, the problems of which it is aware.</p>

<a name="100301-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10030150000011"></a>The Minister has been helpful in circulating to all of us the information that he has received from the Law Society's regulatory body. This information indicates that the society is very alert to the practices of the law firms in question, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. There is a debate as to which of the approaches-the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, or ours-is the correct way of dealing with this. He is right that this gives the Minister the opportunity to get into the Bill something that can deal with the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10030150000012"></a>Perhaps I may put into one sentence-when people say that, they usually go on to speak for five minutes-what I feel is the view on these Benches. As noble Lords will have realised, I have always been hugely sympathetic to the interests of the creative industries. I completely buy the argument that we cannot allow our creative industries to suffer from the illegal downloading of material. However, the creative industries have spent a large number of years trying to get their act together in relation to what they want the Government to do. They have eventually arrived at that point, and we now have the proposals for the code and the technical measures. However, the creative industries cannot have it both ways. They cannot have the huge amount of effort which Ofcom, the Government and everyone else will be putting into getting the technical measures into place-let alone the costs which will be incurred both by the ISPs and by themselves-while at the same time saying, "But we also want to reserve the right to send letters to people through our lawyers saying that if they do not pay their £500, there will be frightful consequences". Under this amendment, if the copyright owner believes that there is a breach, it will have to go through the technical measures rather than go to court.</p>

However, I wonder whether he does not feel that, on reflection, and on a close reading, government Amendment 100 largely deals with all the problems that he has raised, including the prospect of costs being awarded to the subscriber. That should be a sufficient deterrent to rogue firms of solicitors who try to make a quick buck by writing threatening letters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10030150000014"></a>The Government have given every evidence of having listened to everything that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said in Committee, and with which I largely agreed. The balance was too heavily tilted in favour of the copyright owners. However, that balance has been addressed by the Government's later amendments. I am not sure that I see the point of looking for something extra at this point.</p>

Although I take the noble Lord's point that Amendment 100 addresses this issue, it deals with it only in the context of a letter that has been raised within the confines of the Bill. The point being made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is that law firms and others could continue to send letters which are nowhere within the ambit of the Bill and which are not controlled under it. So they can put whatever they want into those letters. They could even refer to the letter in a way that would give the illusion that this legislation is involved.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10030150000016"></a>This may sound like a different point, but it is not. When we had the confusion over people asking for information about subscribers' telephone details, we ended up having the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to try to consolidate the position. People did not know whether requests were genuine. It would be a big loophole if we left in the Bill a system that could give rise to abuse. We now have a chance to knock this on the head once and for all. Then we can do everything in a proper and consolidated way, and we will know where we stand.</p>

We have concerning evidence, as we all said in Committee, that one and now apparently two so-called solicitors are behaving in this way. Clearly this has to cease. Equally, there has recently been legislation and the establishment of new bodies which are just coming into effect. I am less keen to put something into the Bill immediately, as it will not necessarily be the right answer to the problem. I am a little more cautious about it at this stage. It has to be dealt with and is disgraceful. If these firms really are law firms, they are bringing their whole profession into disrepute.</p>

As my noble friend the Minister knows, I am deeply sceptical about the approach of this Bill. One of the reasons for that scepticism-and one of the reasons detected by the rather small group of consumers who actually understand these things-is an awareness of these kinds of abuses being committed under the present system by the rights holders who to go to court and, even more diabolically, by some of their legal representatives. Acceptance of the future system proposed in the Bill would be aided if these abuses were cleared out of the existing system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10030150000020"></a>With due respect to my noble friend Lord Gordon, Amendment 100-with which there will be some difficulties anyway-does not address this issue because it is a post facto situation involving someone who has gone through the technical measures and procedures in the Bill. The abuse addressed in the amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, involves the present system of going through the courts. That has given some rights holders and their representatives a pretty poor reputation among those who ought to be enthusiastic consumers of their output. This has in part soured discussion about the objective the Government are trying to achieve in the Bill. I hope that one of these amendments appeals to the Government-it ought to. If not, the Government ought to come up with one that deals with this very serious abuse once and for all.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10030150000022"></a>On these Benches we are very pleased to see that the House is generally much more sympathetic to amendments of this nature. Obviously, they have been redrafted to be less exclusive in terms of ousting the courts, but as the Minister himself in his letter to us said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="10030150000106"></a>"There will be occasions where the notification system is not appropriate, and it is important that we allow rights holders some flexibility, rather than tie the hands of the entire creative industries due to the possible poor conduct of some isolated parties".</p>

<p><a name="10030150000095"></a>We took that on board in formulating these amendments. Clearly, we are very strong supporters of the system of graduated response, which as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said is being considerably improved as a result of amendments to the Bill. However, in the meantime we learn of new entrants to the hall of infamy, such as Tilly Bailey &amp; Irvine-the second law firm which I do not think anybody has mentioned in addition to ACS:Law. We also know more about the firm responsible for the investigations, Logistep. As my noble friend mentioned, the activities of these two law firms and Logistep are an embarrassment to the rest of the creative rights industry. We have seen more letters since Committee stage which demonstrate the methods being used by these law firms, which are of a threatening nature-some six or so pages as a first letter is grossly disproportionate.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10030150000023"></a>I am delighted to be able to quote for the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, the paragraph that the Solicitors Regulation Authority has sent to both me and the Minister in more or less identical terms:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="10030150000107"></a>"We appreciate the impact that receiving letters from ACS:Law is having on individuals, and the need to bring this matter to a conclusion as soon as we are able. However, we have to undertake a thorough investigation to ensure the right outcome in the public interest".</p>

<p><a name="10030150000096"></a>It has assured several noble Lords that it will keep us informed of progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10030150000024"></a>With respect, I mention to the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, that Amendment 100, which he talked about, is on a wholly separate issue-appeals against technical measures-and does not cover the matter in hand.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10030150000025"></a>We are pleased that the SRA has said that it will deal with this with dispatch. However, we feel something in the order of the amendments tabled by the noble

It is a considerable problem for many people up and down the country and will remain so unless we make sure that the code almost invariably applies in the first instance.</p>

<a name="10030150000026"></a><b><a name="100301-0011.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10030150000134"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> My Lords, I rise very briefly. We sympathise a great deal with much of what has been said, but it is an important point of principle that nothing that is put in the Bill prevents rights holders from using civil proceedings.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10030150000027"></a>The initial obligations procedure in this legislation is an additional remedy designed to tackle illegal peer-to-peer file-sharing. That point of principle is important when discussing and looking at these amendments. Amendments 16 and 31 would appear to limit the ability of a rights holder to use established remedies. If rights holders want to go to court to seek damages under existing copyright laws, then this Bill should not stop them from so doing.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10030150000028"></a>On these Benches we obviously agree with the aim of stopping unscrupulous law firms sending demanding letters to unknowing and innocent customers. However, I am not sure whether the way to stop these is to stop rights holders being able to exercise their legitimate claims in a timely manner.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10030150000029"></a>Finally on this issue, I thank the Minister for taking this matter up with the Secretary of State for Justice. While I appreciate that he will not wish to comment before the individual cases are resolved, can he give the House an update on discussion with his government colleagues about alternative means by which help can be given to protect consumers?</p>

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="10030150000030"></a><b><a name="100301-0011.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10030150000135"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, as I  have expressed on previous occasions, I sympathise with the concerns-there is nothing between us on  the problem. I understand the intent behind these amendments. Though I did not initially receive the letters I am sure I am being included in the loop; I get the letters now. I share the concern: I would liken them to rogue wheel-clampers, if I can use that analogy.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10030150000031"></a>There are certainly some law firms which appear to act in a way that some consider heavy-handed or unfair. However, the proper way to control the conduct of law firms is through the independent regulator, and that is what we are doing. Following discussion of this matter in Committee, we wrote to the Lord Chancellor, as has been heard, to bring this matter to his personal attention. As you know, we have received a reply from the Ministry of Justice, and a further letter from the Solicitors Regulation Authority. These letters explain that there have been complaints and a thorough investigation is under way. Like all noble Lords, I wish it could act more promptly and we could bring this to an end.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10030150000032"></a>It is fair to say that we expect that copyright owners will want to use this notification system to tackle appropriate cases. Indeed, should the Bill become an Act, the courts may choose to view the approach taken within it as an example of good practice for cases of this sort-although clearly this would be for the judiciary to decide.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1261"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10030150000033"></a>We believe that the notification system is fair and proportionate, and we hope that it will be effective. However, we do not believe it is right to remove flexibility from the courts and copyright owners in the way these amendments seek to. There will be occasions, as my noble-I nearly said friend-the noble Lord, Lord Howard, quite rightly pointed out, when the notification system is just not appropriate, and there is no justification for adding extra difficulty to those cases. I remind noble Lords that the graduated approach which we seem to accept as the right way forward was really designed to deal with the mass problems of peer-to-peer file-sharing. That is why we talked about behavioural change, and why that was appropriate. However, in certain cases this is not appropriate-for example, where people are stealing or infringing high-value copyright, or where there is a need for action to be taken more promptly-then, as the noble Lord, Lord Howard, said, we cannot deny copyright holders an alternative approach. This notification system will not be appropriate, and there is no justification for adding extra difficulty to those cases.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10030150000034"></a>The right to access the courts is a fundamental one, and to limit this in any way may infringe upon basic human rights, as well as on the free exercise of the property right in copyright itself. It is not that we do not want to be of assistance-we want to help. However, going down the route suggested in these amendments unfortunately will not solve the problem.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10030150000035"></a>I will rest on this final point, which is another reason why we cannot accept the amendments however much we sympathise with their aim. The right to take action against a person who has infringed your copyright is enshrined in international and European law. There is also a more fundamental question here: the right of access to the courts and access to redress for a civil wrong. Human rights are engaged, as well as matters of constitutional law. This is a matter that needs to be solved through regulation, not by interfering in these basic rights. It is not that we do not have a great deal of sympathy. In a way, we wish that we could do this. Unfortunately, however, the suggested remedies are not capable of being introduced, and they are not appropriate for the reasons that I have mentioned.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10030150000036"></a>I hope the noble Lord will recognise that we have treated this matter seriously and that we will continue to do so. We will continue to press the Ministry of Justice and the Solicitors Regulation Authority to act on this. In the light of the points I have made, I hope he will feel capable of withdrawing the amendment.</p>

Rogue wheel-clampers are merely enforcing their rights of private property. I suppose that bailiffs are doing an excellent job in retrieving lots of money for the public purse and for creditors. Here we have another case where many tens of thousands of people are subject to something that is not as we would wish it to be in a proper and perfect world.</p>

It would be immensely helpful to hear that from the Government and to know that this is not a permanent disfigurement on the face of copyright law and practice.

Perhaps it would be helpful to explain how this fits with the current core regime for jobseekers.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10030150000043"></a>The department is currently introducing a new jobseekers regime and implementing the Flexible New Deal, which builds on the successes of the outgoing new deals, to offer a much more personalised and responsive service to jobseeker's allowance customers. The new regime offers increasing support to people during the first 12 months of their jobseeker's allowance claim and expects individuals, in return, to undertake more activities to return to work the longer they   


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1263"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remain unemployed. This is particularly noticeable from the six-month stage in a claim, where jobseekers are required to undertake particular activities to improve their chances of finding work. After 12 months, individuals will join the Flexible New Deal which is provider-led and aims to deliver whatever support a person needs to move into work.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10030150000044"></a>Of course, the recession has made things tougher. But the Government have responded by making available up to £5 billion to provide significant extra assistance to help jobseekers find work. That means that more help is now available to everybody prior to redundancy and from the start of a claim. Those out of work for six months or more have access to new support, including retraining opportunities. Furthermore, all 18 to 24 year-olds are guaranteed an offer of a job, training or work experience through the young persons guarantee after six months on JSA.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10030150000045"></a>The Government are also introducing the new integrated employment and skills service in which early contact with Jobcentre Plus and a learning provider or adult careers services will provide the range of services to address the specific skills needs of customers and overcome employment-related barriers to work. In return for this support, the Government expect individuals to take increased responsibility and have committed to take the legislative powers necessary to pilot requiring jobseeker's allowance customers to address their skills needs as a condition for receipt of benefits. This pilot will run in 11 Jobcentre Plus districts that have already embedded both the Flexible New Deal and IES services.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10030150000046"></a>We know that skills and qualifications play a vital role in improving labour market outcomes, both for individuals and society. Those with higher qualifications are more likely to be employed and earn more than people with lower level or no qualifications. Around 4.6 million people possess no qualifications at all and 3.5 million of those fall into at least one other priority group-they are disabled, aged 50 or over, a lone parent or from an ethnic minority. The employment rate of those with level 2 qualifications or above is around 20 percentage points higher than those with qualifications below level 2 or with no qualifications.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10030150000047"></a>We want to make sure that jobseekers understand that it is not acceptable to refuse the help that could provide them with greater life chances. My noble friend Lord Leitch said in his final report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="10030150000108"></a>"Individuals must raise their sights, aspirations and motivation and invest in their own skills. Where skills were once <I>a </I>key lever for prosperity and fairness, they are now increasingly <I>the </I>key lever. The UK can only achieve world class prosperity and fairness if it achieves world class skills".</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10030150000048"></a>For those out of work, the skills that they have to offer employers are critical to their chances of finding a new job. There is a direct relationship between how good a person's skills are and what their prospects are for employment. The longer a jobseeker remains on benefit, the greater the levels of support. But in return for this support the Government rightly expect individuals to step up to those requirements. However, we know that even where a customer has identified a training  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1264"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>need, they do not always take up or complete provision to address that need. They often simply give up or lose interest.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10030150000049"></a>It is not acceptable that those who are disadvantaged fail to address the very issue that could prevent them from realising their potential. That is why we have designed the JSA skills conditionality pilots so that we can learn whether equipping people with the right training means that they can ultimately get sustainable jobs and move away from a life on benefit.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10030150000050"></a>The proposal to pilot skills conditionality was first announced in 2006 and details have been included in a series of Green Papers. Meanwhile, the Social Security Advisory Committee carried out a consultation on  the regulations. We are grateful to SSAC and to those who responded to it. We acknowledge the concerns of SSAC about why the department did not conduct a full consultation on these regulations, and as a department we will continually look at how we can improve in this area. DWP is not averse to consultation; indeed there were 26 separate consultations during 2009, and there have already been six consultations this year. We take the comments of the committee seriously and the Permanent Secretary has recently stressed the importance of consultation to senior officials.</p>

<a name="100301-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10030150000051"></a>In this particular instance, DWP quite rightly placed great emphasis on introducing the recession measures that were urgently needed to combat rising unemployment. The enormous amount of officials' time required for those measures unfortunately resulted in a wider consultation not taking place before SSAC was consulted. For this, I apologise. We do, however, consider that those who responded to the SSAC consultation would have raised similar questions to a DWP consultation.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10030150000052"></a>The Social Security Advisory Committee formally reported to the Secretary of State on 28 September 2009 and its advice was not to proceed with the pilots, as it had some concerns about the design of the pilot and the impact of sanctions. However, it made a series of recommendations, the majority of which have been accepted. These include delaying the start of the pilot to ensure resources are in place, producing a clear communication strategy for customers and putting necessary training in place for advisers.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10030150000053"></a>The recommendations that were not accepted included delaying the pilot until the IES service had been fully evaluated and reconsidering the design of the pilot. We rejected those recommendations because we believe that the evaluation approach is robust. It has a randomisation element to make sure that any differences between the test group and control group are not due to specific characteristics of the individual, such as motivation, preferences or background, but just simply due to the effects of mandation. Meanwhile, IES is fully operational in the pilot locations where skills mandation will apply. As such, we can find no reason to delay the pilot until IES is fully rolled out.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10030150000054"></a>Subject to approval of the regulations, these pilots will build on the existing IES service where jobseekers who have been unemployed for 26 weeks will have their needs assessed and if there are skills barriers they will be referred to training. In the pilots, customers will be randomly allocated to either the test mandatory training group or the control group, according to their  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1265"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>national insurance number. The regulations will empower Jobcentre Plus advisers to refer customers in the test group to training in the full knowledge that they could incur a sanction. All the pilot areas already have the Flexible New Deal in place and this sits well with skills conditionality as this regime requires that customers increase conditionality requirements the longer they claim benefits.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10030150000055"></a>This measure was also considered by the Merits Committee on 12 January, and I will touch now on just a couple of the comments made by the committee. It was noted that the two previous skills pilots were not successful in identifying positive outcomes for customers involved. Indeed the results were not encouraging. However, the conditions under which these new pilots will operate will be very different to those which prevailed in previous trials. These new trials will be offering a wider variety of training that may or may not lead to a formal qualification, for example pre-employment skills including CV writing and interview technique, IT skills or Construction Industry Training Board training.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10030150000056"></a>Another key difference to previous pilots is the integrated employment and skills service that is already running at a steady state in the 11 pilot districts with Jobcentre Plus and the Learning and Skills Council-soon to become the Skills Funding Agency-working together on the ground to make sure customers can access training that will help them move into jobs.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10030150000057"></a>The Merits Committee also raised an issue originally made by SSAC concerning our ability to produce robust evaluation when these pilots are running concurrently with the Flexible New Deal.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10030150000058"></a>We are confident that we will be able to distinguish the effects as they have been designed to deliver very different things. These pilots will specifically measure the impact that skills training has on employment outcomes. The objective of the randomisation process is to establish two groups-test and control-that are as identical as is practical in all their characteristics. The only difference is that one group may be mandated with the threat of sanctions, and the other not. This means that the effect of the Flexible New Deal should be similar in both groups. When we measure the different job outcomes between both groups, we are in fact looking at the effect of mandation, independently of the participation of individuals in the Flexible New Deal.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10030150000059"></a>Those in both the test group and control group will be identified by a pilot marker and the customers will be tracked over a longer period-up to 2013-to look at achievement of sustained employment outcomes.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10030150000060"></a>It is right and fair that the state continues to support people during times of unemployment. However, the right to support comes in exchange for taking clear steps to improve circumstances. To help customers achieve their aspirations, we will continue to work with employers who want to recruit people with the right skills. Improving the way we work with employers by understanding what skills they need and providing relevant training to jobseekers will be a key aspect of our approach. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="10030150000061"></a><b><a name="100301-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10030150000142"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> My Lords, at first glance this looks like an extraordinary Motion to move about something as welcome as a pilot scheme to improve skills training among those who are looking for jobs. I must say straight away that we on these Benches are as keen as anyone for those who are out of work and on jobseeker's allowance to be offered suitable training to enable them to learn new skills or hone existing skills in order to find a job. That is not the issue before the House this evening.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10030150000062"></a>The key to the reason I have moved the amendment to the Motion lies in the word "conditionality", which means that in the pilot areas certain jobseekers are going to be forced to take skills training on pain of losing a good part of their benefits if they default. My criticism of this order is based on two hazards: whether the pilots are being introduced prematurely and the nature of the pilots.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10030150000063"></a>At this point, I remind the House, as the Minister did, that the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee has drawn these regulations to the attention of the House on the grounds that they may imperfectly achieve their policy objective.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10030150000064"></a>First, I turn to the timing of the pilots and whether they are being introduced prematurely. We are told that this pilot is different from the other pilots held in 2001 and 2004, when skills training was sanctioned. Not surprisingly, the Government are keen to distance themselves from the results of both those pilots, which showed that sanctioning basic skills training actually had a long-term negative impact on the participants getting a job. We are now told that this training will be different because of the new one year-old integrated employment and skills service, but we do not know how different or exactly what is being developed. This integrated approach has been adopted, as the noble Lord said, following the Leitch report in 2006, which identified that current skills and employment services had different aims, which meant that delivery could  be complex, with an array of agencies trying to give help and advice to people. Although this integrated service is not fully operational until next year, we are told that it is far enough advanced in the new pilot areas for more satisfactory pilots than the earlier ones, which first sanctioned skills training for jobseekers, to take place.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10030150000065"></a>The Government have to their credit delayed the start of the pilots from January of this year to April, at the request of the Social Security Advisory Committee which, it must be stressed, said that this was the least that must be done if the Government were going to ignore its original advice not to proceed with the pilots at all.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10030150000066"></a>The SSAC is in no doubt, however, that this is a very risky venture and says:</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1267"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="10030150000109"></a>"The proposed Mandatory Training pilot is scheduled to start before the new services are fully up and running and we would question whether it is sensible to commence a complex, mandatory pilot before key services are in place and established".</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10030150000067"></a>During questioning of the Minister by the Merits Committee two months ago, we were told that work-focused training in the pilot areas is to be linked to vacancies in the area. If this provision is new-and it sounds like a welcome development-should not a voluntary system at least be trialled rather than having the threat of sanctions hanging over the whole procedure from the outset?</p>
<a name="time_27"></a>
<a name="100301-0012.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="10030150000120"></a>8 pm</h5>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10030150000068"></a>Is there not a danger that, with all the initiatives already being rolled out at Jobcentre Plus offices, the waters are in danger of being muddied with what is on offer and how it is being delivered? Are personal advisers in Jobcentre Plus offices in the pilot areas being sufficiently trained in how to manage this complex and expensive trial? Having read quite a bit of the recently published evaluations of the Jobseekers Regime and Flexible New Deal, the Six Month Offer and Support for the Newly Unemployed, I am not convinced that this is the case. For example, on page 162, in a paragraph about the design of the Flexible New Deal needing a more personalised approach by JCP advisers, there are some alarming findings. The document states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="10030150000110"></a>"In general, a lack of training and support for the new approach placed advisers at a disadvantage, particularly the new recruits and New Claim advisers. Such advisers often lacked awareness of the range of local provision available to which they could refer or signpost customers. Under time pressures, training was often not completed before new recruits were placed in posts and the electronic format of the training was often considered unsatisfactory. As a consequence, many advisers lacked the experience, confidence and sometimes motivation to exercise their discretion".</p>

<p><a name="10030150000097"></a>On page 28, we read:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="10030150000111"></a>"A recurring theme was that the time pressures imposed by the recession had curtailed the amount of training staff were able to undertake".</p>

<p><a name="10030150000098"></a>The document further states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="10030150000112"></a>"Generally, the speed of change and the volume of new material posed a challenge to staff who were implementing the new recessionary measures-Support for the Newly Unemployed and the Six Months Offer. The introduction of these services was considered to be 'rushed' in Phase 2 districts and 'too much, too quickly' when combined with the Jobseekers Regime Flexible New Deal".</p>

<p><a name="10030150000099"></a>These comments do not instil confidence that JCP staff are ready for yet another pilot. Is the Minister really certain that by April all will be well and all the personal advisers in the relevant districts will have received adequate training for this new and complex pilot?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="10030150000069"></a>While looking at the evaluations, I see that there are also some disturbing, although not surprising, findings about sanctioning that are relevant to this debate. On page 157 we read:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="10030150000113"></a>"The planned changes to the adviser service culture were seen to be developing but as yet not much adjustment had occurred. Alongside this, the expected changes in customer obligations"-</p>

<p><a name="10030150000100"></a>presumably, this means sanctions-</p>
<ul><a name="10030150000116"></a>"did not seem to be delivered to the extent planned. In this, the early signs indicated a perceived contradiction between the advisory service giving flexible, personalised delivery through their interactions   


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1268"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with customers, and the negative effects of enforcing obligations (via the threat of, or actual sanctioning) on the service relationship. This contradiction might prove complex to overcome".</ul>
<p><a name="10030150000101"></a>Later in the evaluations report, and more specifically, we are told that there is a perception that mandating activities and threats of sanctioning can be unconstructive to establishing a good adviser-customer relationship, and that some staff were reluctant to sanction. This may account for another finding, which is that claimants were often leaving interviews without fully understanding the sanctioning regime. This is certainly the experience of many CAB officers around the country.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="10030150000070"></a>This brings me to the design of the pilots, about which there is a lot of concern. There are to be two groups-the noble Lord told us how it would work-one is the treatment group, where non-attendance at training could risk benefit sanctions from Jobseeker's Regime Flexible New Deal stage 3; the other is the control group, who do not risk this sanction. The groups will be chosen by randomisation; that is to say, the personal adviser locally will use the final digit of the claimant's national insurance number. An even number means that the claimant will go into one group, an odd number and it will be the other group. We are told that claimants will be told exactly what is going on, but I wish that I could fully believe this. Where the complexity comes in is the assumption that the skills needs of claimants are evenly distributed across both groups, so that apples can be compared with apples and not with pears. This will again put a lot of responsibility on to JCP personal advisers. I hope that their training on this very specific activity is adequate.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="10030150000071"></a>There is to be full evaluation of this pilot. The Minister told the Merits Committee that it will tell us "once and for all" whether sanctions for training work, but I wonder whether the jobs market is stable enough for this really to be the case. We were told that pilots will not be held in areas of very high unemployment, but our chairman pointed out that one of the pilot areas was to be Lambeth, where TUC figures show that in January last year there were 29 claimants for every vacancy. I cannot believe that the figures are much better now. I should have said earlier that I am a member of the Merits Committee, which is why I talk about "our chairman".</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="10030150000072"></a>I note that the first of the four types of training the department is offering is literacy and English for speakers of other languages. Looking at ESOL first, if this training is to be mandated, I assume that it will be free and that there will be enough classes at various levels in all the pilot areas. Will the Minister confirm this? We know that the Government now charge for ESOL classes, so I would be interested to know whether all participants will be learning together, or whether those who are mandated will be taught separately from those who have to pay. I assume that literacy and ESOL are separate, with literacy being appropriate for native English speakers, so will there be two distinct classes, one for native English speakers perhaps to learn to read and write better and other classes for ESOL?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10030150000073"></a>Looking at training more generally on offer for these pilots, is the Minister convinced that all training providers will accept mandated claimants on to their courses? It is an absolutely vital point. The SSAC is  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1269"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerned that without guaranteed access, the situation could arise whereby a mandated claimant is turned away from a suitable course. I am sure the Minister's brief will make the point that the integrated employment skills service will ensure that this is not the case, but the SSAC report is not convinced and nor am I. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="10030150000114"></a>"If the training and support on offer are genuinely attractive and effective there would appear to be no need for a mandatory programme".</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10030150000074"></a>I make no apology for raising at this point a problem I asked the Minister, Helen Goodman, about during the Merits Committee cross-questioning in January. I was concerned about the high number of people "failing" the new work capability assessment, which has meant that more people are being put on JSA rather than ESA. This will mean that inevitably there will be some claimants who have mental health problems and some who are likely to be on the autistic spectrum. Although we know that claimants with disabilities are supposed to see a disability benefit adviser, I am not convinced that the people who fall into the categories I have mentioned will in all cases find their way to such a person.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10030150000075"></a>For example, I know of one case where a mother was not available to take her autistic son to attend an interview and was worried that his social worker was on holiday. She was told that only one change of appointment was allowed before sanctions would apply. I have just been told of another case where a claimant was on the highest rate of disability living allowance who failed his WCA with zero points. On appeal, he was awarded the necessary 15 points. Could the Minister tell us if it is really true that nine out of 10 applicants now fail the WCA? I am hearing about these cases all the time and I am sure that the Minister is too. There is a strong belief in the advice sector that the Government have given ATOS targets to fail people who go for a WCA. If this is bunkum, will the Minister refute it categorically?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10030150000076"></a>Finally, I must come back to where I started by emphasising that we on these Benches are very much in favour of skills training. We despair as much as anyone about the large number of NEETS-those young people not in education, employment or training-and believe that as much as possible should be done to try to upskill this group so that they can get good quality and sustainable jobs. However, we have grave misgivings about using the threat of sanctions to get these young people and, indeed, all relevant jobseekers, to engage with training. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="10030150000077"></a><b><a name="100301-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10030150000143"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches very much welcome the policy direction of these regulations. It is absolutely right that every effort should be made to ensure that the welfare state is not a something-for-nothing concept, that its resources are protected for those who truly need them and that they are not used up by those who can work and contribute to society and the economy, but who choose not to. However, like the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, I have reservations about these regulations and a number of questions I should like to ask the Minister.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10030150000078"></a>First, the monitoring and review process referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum is rather vague and  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1270"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1270</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>paragraphs 12.1 and 12.3 do not even mention job outcomes. In fact, job outcomes is the last of the four bullet points in paragraph 12.2. Can the Minister define what is meant by a successful job outcome? Are we talking about a permanent job or a temporary job? What exactly does it mean? Overall, does the Minister not agree that the evaluation should be clear and easy to understand?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10030150000079"></a>Paragraph 7.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum lists four bullet points on which training is to be modelled. They are</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="10030150000115"></a>"Basic Skills and English language for speakers of other languages; ... Employability skills; ... Short, job focused training of up to eight weeks; and ... Other job related provision".</p>

<p><a name="10030150000102"></a>This, too, is extraordinarily vague. I wonder how effective this will be as a direction; not very, I fear. Will the Minister give us a little more detail-I know he mentioned some on introducing the regulations in the first place-about the type of training that will be provided? How does he envisage that people will be in a better position to get jobs afterwards?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="10030150000080"></a>Given there is already strong criticism about the standard and content of training that is given by jobcentres, where it is often described as "one size fits all", can the Minister assure us that training will be more intelligently tailored to meet individual participants' needs? Like the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, I should like to ask about the qualifications of the people who assess the training needs. What qualifications or training do they have in personal development?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="10030150000081"></a>What further action are the Government taking to ensure that the record number of young people, the NEETs-those not in employment, education or training-are being quickly placed on suitable training courses? Can the Minister tell us how involved businesses and employers will be in identifying the skills needed in the pilot areas? Can he provide assurances that customers will receive skills appropriate for the job market?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="10030150000082"></a>However, where we are particularly worried is with regard to the time it will take to evaluate the pilot. We are in the middle of a severe recession. When do Her Majesty's Government anticipate publishing the results of this pilot? Given that the Government closed a jobcentre every week in 2008, while unemployment was rising, can the Minister assure the House that the jobcentres involved will have the appropriate resources to implement the pilot?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="10030150000083"></a>The UK still lags well behind most of our competitors regarding adult numeracy and literacy. The number of people who have taken up skills for life programmes is far less than the number of adults without basic literacy and numeracy skills and progress has been limited. Does the Minister accept that a new approach needs to be taken to ensure that we do not get left even further behind? What plans are in place to ensure that this does not happen?</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10030150000084"></a>Lastly, paragraph 4.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum mentions data sharing. Given the various recent blunders with data going into the public domain, when such details should not have been released, will the Minister please explain what protections on data sharing are in place?</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1271"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="10030150000085"></a>At a time when long-term unemployment is still rising, when more than 1 million people who are fortunate enough to be in part-time work want a full-time job and when employment continues to fall to the lowest rate for 13 years, we need bold action to get Britain back on its feet and on the way to work. That means we cannot continue with a top-down, unpersonalised approach to policy.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="10030150000086"></a>I repeat that we welcome the concept of these regulations, but we have concerns about the quality, the appropriateness and the lack of individualised and bespoke training that will lead to the outcomes we all want, which are sustainable jobs and progression in work. Frankly, I have to say that we do not believe that these regulations are up to the task, considering the scale of the problem this country faces. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>
<a name="time_28"></a>
<a name="100301-0012.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="10030150000121"></a>8.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="10030150000087"></a><b><a name="100301-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10030150000144"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment that has been so capably moved by my noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester. Before I do anything else, I should just remind the House that I am a non-executive, non-remunerated director of the Wise Group, a job-provider in Glasgow.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10030150000088"></a>I also start by saying that I think the work that has been done by the Social Security Advisory Committee and the Merits Committee on these regulations is, as ever, immensely helpful. My previous incarnation was in another place, where a merits committee just does not exist, and it should take a tip-it should take many tips-from what happens in this place. The Merits Committee is extremely important and particularly at this time because there are so many statutory instruments coming through. I do not need to tell the Treasury Bench that because it has to do them all. Trying to make sense of the volume of stuff that comes out, particularly from the Department for Work and Pensions, is very hard. I am deeply grateful for the work that the Merits Committee and the Social Security Advisory Committee do in trying to interpret the importance and significance of the content of the policy that they contain.</p>

<a name="100301-0012.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10030150000089"></a>I, together with colleagues who have already spoken, am very nervous about these regulations, and part of that nervousness derives from my experience in the Wise Group in Glasgow. One thing that training providers tell you is that they are loath to get involved in dealing with conscripts. My noble friend mentioned that. There could be a situation where people join training groups simply in order to shelter from the conditionality regime contained in these regulations. If you are to be successful in training, you need an engaged group of people who are willing not just to turn up but to switch on their brains and think carefully about what they are being told and to do the necessary follow-up homework, whether it is English classes or anything else. If two or three people in a small group of students or clients are there merely because they are sheltering from their benefit reductions, that will create a very unhappy situation because the training group will suffer as a result. I do not think that that has begun to be understood in these regulations.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="10030150000090"></a>However, I absolutely understand the need for conditionality. To use a very inelegant metaphor, it is a bit like manure. If you spread the conditionality at the appropriate dosage over the appropriate surface, it will work and be to everyone's benefit, but if you pile it on in a corner, then people will get hurt-the plants will be destroyed. I am sorry; I should have thought about that metaphor earlier.</p>

<a name="10030150000092"></a><b><a name="100301-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10030150000146"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I shall move on quickly but I have made the point. Conditionality is now an important part of the regime that we are working with and everyone understands that. My noble friend made that quite clear and I concur with that view. However, conditionality has to be applied very carefully if it is to work.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="10030150000093"></a>Against that background, my second point is that the balance of power-if I may put it in that rather dramatic way-that exists between the client and the personal adviser is crucial here as well. We have had many happy debates on this subject during the Committee and other stages of welfare-to-work Bills in the past, and if it is true in most other circumstances, it is absolutely true here. If this is to be a tailored, personalised service, which is what the Government lauds it and argues it to be, then at the point where the client comes into the integrated employment service, he or she needs to feel that there is an element of control-that they can make suggestions-in order to get to a better place. If that kind of approach is taken rather than telling them what they need to do, they start the journey back to work in a much better and more positive way. If we are to have a personalised system under these regulations, the personal advisers need  to be sympathetic to that question overall. I want to come back to the training points that my noble friend raised, but a key point for me is that, when clients have left the interview, they should feel that they have had some control over the training requirements being offered to them.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10030150000094"></a>Thirdly, this issue is often talked about in terms of an integrated employment service and a skill, but there are different changes in the different constituent parts of the United Kingdom. That is not an insignificant point because things are done differently in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. However, within the skills approach it must not be forgotten that a lot of clients need biopsychosocial support before they can be shown how to be a plumber. They come from very disadvantaged places and their psychological situation needs to be recognised holistically. You cannot simply sign them up to a further education college course and expect them to survive. Steps need to be taken before they reach the position where they can go into a further education college and survive. All that is important. I think that such progression is properly understood in most cases, but there will be people in this stage 3 Flexible New Deal client group who need holistic support before they go on to what everyone else would understand as proper skills training. If that is not properly observed by these regulations and by the personal advisers who implement them, the policy will not succeed.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1273"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10030162000001"></a>Distance travelled is just as important for those clients who are furthest away from the labour market as are job outcomes. In the evaluation-and I have some doubts about the suggestions for the evaluation of these pilot schemes-the distance travelled from where people are when they come into the integrated employment service towards a position where they have any hope of competing in the labour market is equally important. If we do not recognise that people need to make that journey and that those who make the transition get much closer to the labour market than they were when they started, we are not being fair to the efforts that they are making. The system needs to recognise that.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10030162000002"></a>Against that background, staff training is important, as my noble friend said, but the amount of time that clients have available with the staff after they have been properly trained is equally important. I am told various things about how often and how long clients get with personal advisers. I am assuming that the 3,000 new people whom we have taken on are all now properly trained. They have not been around for very long and I hear stories about the training being cut. However, if the training is inadequate and people are only getting 10 or 20 minutes at a time, the transformation that is necessary to get some of these clients in stage 3 of Flexible New Deal into anything approaching a trade or an apprenticeship scheme is a long, long journey and it will not start properly unless the personal advisers are both well trained and able to give the help when it is really needed.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="10030162000003"></a>In my experience-and any provider will tell you this-in a journey to work, people suddenly get it. Invariably, if the process works, a light bulb goes on in people's heads and they say, "Okay, if that is what I need to do, I understand that now and I am ready to really put myself into this". If they are not into it, if they are resistant or recalcitrant, or if they are conscripts, you are not engaging with them at all. However, when the light bulb goes on, the system needs to recognise that and move quickly so that support follows and there is a successful outcome. Personal advisers need to be alive to that moment happening and make sure that they do not miss it. Lack of staff training and lack of access by individuals to their personal advisers are a roadblock to that.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="10030162000004"></a>I want to make a point about baseline evaluations, which I just do not understand. I am reading from the fifth Merits Committee report, at page 9. There is a statement from the department, but it is not explained anywhere. I have never heard anything like it before. It claims that the,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="10030162000113"></a>"DWP anticipate a 'projected 5% increase in attendance rates' and assume that 'for every 10 additional individuals who complete provision because of conditionality, an additional year of employment will be generated'".</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="10030162000005"></a>Where does that come from? Is that a guess? Is there some research? Is there any international experience that justifies that? It seems to me to be completely unsubstantiated. It is an example of how the evaluation of these regulations and the basis on which they are set up leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="10030162000006"></a>I agree with my noble friend that the timing of these pilots is too soon. I would have been much happier if they had been at least later in the year. The  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1274"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>autumn would have been better, because, once we have the Comprehensive Spending Review, when the new Government are in place-whosoever they are-we will see some changes that will affect the public sector workforce substantially. That will dramatically affect, I fear, the number of cases that the integrated employment service will have to cope with. Who will be the people who suffer most? It will be the stage 3 Flexible New Deal people, because they are the most disadvantaged. Therefore, I think that these pilots are premature. They are not only premature, but I am not convinced that there are sufficient resources in play to be confident that they will do the job that they seek to do. As I said, it is hard to feel confident about the methodology.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="10030162000007"></a>I am in favour of trying this. As my noble friend said, upskilling people and getting them closer to the labour market is something that we all have an interest in. If my colleagues and I on this side sound critical, it is not because we do not will the end; it is because we just do not think that these regulations will do what they set out to do. If that is the case, it is matter of great concern and I hope that the Minister will respond as best he can to some of the legitimate complaints that people have made about these regulations.</p>

I can summarise the mood of the debate as being in general supportive of the direction of travel with some concerns about some of the detail-in some cases, quite a lot of the detail. Questions were asked and points were made and I shall deal with as many of them as I can.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="10030162000009"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, spoke about concerns about conditionality, although that is now well embedded in the system of our welfare reform programmes. The vast majority of JSA customers comply with the conditions imposed. Just one in 10 has their benefits sanctioned. Research has shown that sanctions influence the behaviour of claimants. A survey of around 3,000 JSA customers found that almost half said that they were more likely to look for work as a result of sanctions. We expect fewer than 400 sanctions to be applied during the pilot. Jobcentre Plus already has a robust sanctioning regime that ensures that customers are given an opportunity to claim good cause and thereby avoid a sanction. Vulnerable customers can claim hardship allowance and all customers have full rights of appeal against any sanction decision.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="10030162000010"></a>Guidance being developed for advisers will ensure that the risk of sanction is minimised by ensuring that customers' views and concerns are addressed and incorporated in the action plan, referring customers with motivational barriers to appropriate support before moving them on to the necessary skills training, and agreeing the type and duration of training suitable to address the individual customer's skills needs and to move that customer closer to the labour market. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that having willing people who want to undertake this is a key barrier. Customers will be given choice, wherever possible, over full-time or part-time training, the venue and the start date. However, where there is a skills need, doing nothing will not be an option. Explaining clearly to all  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1275"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1275</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>customers what the pilot is about, the importance of attending training and the impact of sanctions will be key.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="10030162000011"></a>Advisers will be fully trained to identify skills needs, to respond to them and to handle the randomisation of customers. An early evaluation of the IES shows that customers value adviser discussions. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, referred to adviser training and suggested that it was poor in the Flexible New Deal regime and the young person's guarantee. The early findings outlined will be taken into account as the JSA regime and the recession measures bed in. However, it is essential that we get recession-based support in place quickly.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="10030162000012"></a>Referrals for sanctions decisions are identified by Jobcentre Plus front-line staff and are referred to a Jobcentre Plus decision-maker to look at the facts, including the customer's side of the story. The decision-maker is impartial and will consider evidence from the adviser and the customer set against the regulations and case law. If the doubt is upheld, the claim is suspended and no payment is made for the time that the individual failed to meet the conditions. So far as someone being mandated to training and the training provider not taking him is concerned, if that is not a good cause, I do not know what would be one. It would be difficult to see that situation, if it came to pass, leading to sanctions.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="10030162000013"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said that there is a contradiction between mandation and flexibility. We do not accept that. The range of support on offer in the new JSA regime is flexible and tailored and offers a wide range of choice. It is only if a jobseeker refuses to take up any of this support that sanctions come into play. This in no way limits choice or flexibility.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="10030162000014"></a>The principal objectives of the evaluation of the JSA skills conditionality pilot are to determine: whether the new measures impact on short-term or long-term job outcomes; whether the new measures impact on sustainable employment; whether they impact on starting and completing training and the acquisition of qualifications; the impact that the threat of sanctions has on customers' social and psychological well-being; attitudes to training; attitudes to work; what is required to implement the new measures well; and how any economic benefits that are generated compare to the costs.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="10030162000015"></a>The evaluation of the pilot will begin soon after the pilot starts. There will be different interim reports during the life of the pilot, covering quantitative and qualitative elements, which will continue for up to two years after the end of the pilot. From previous experiences, we know that the effects of employment programmes are not immediate and that we need to observe them over a longer term to capture their effects. For that reason, the evaluation intends to cover short-term, medium-term and long-term effects. This requires more than one stage of the evaluation, some of which will happen even after the pilot has ended in October 2011.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="10030162000016"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, referred to concerns around randomisation. A randomised controlled trial is one of the most robust evaluation tools to effectively assess the policy being piloted. It  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1276"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allows us to isolate the impact of other factors that might also have an effect on employment outcomes. The aim of the random assignment is to split the customers eligible for skills training conditionality into two groups, as she identified. The randomisation will occur once a skills need has been identified and relevant training has been agreed and recorded on the customer action plans. The randomisation will be done locally by the personal adviser using the final digit of the customer's national insurance number. We have committed to a clear customer strategy in response to the concerns raised by SSAC. We will inform all customers about the pilot and ask for their consent for their data to be used for research and analytical purposes when training is agreed on the action plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="10030162000017"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, referred to people with health conditions, particularly mental health conditions. It is not our intention, and never would be, to bully people into training, as the Merits Committee might have suggested. Those with health conditions will be able to seek specialised support from the Jobcentre Plus disability employment adviser and will be able to place reasonable restrictions on their availability for work and for any training, due to their condition. We have discussed this on a number of occasions, so the noble Baroness will be aware of what happens in relation to sanctions for customers with mental health issues. We recognise that the customer's mental or physical condition may impact on their requirements while on JSA. If a customer has failed to attend an appointment or has committed another act or omission that warrants a sanction, the Jobcentre Plus decision-maker will consider all the available evidence before applying a sanction. This can include, but is not limited to, whether the failure was caused by a fluctuation in their health condition. Every effort will be made to contact vulnerable customers before applying sanctions, to make sure that they understand what is required of them. We would not sanction someone with mental health problems without contacting them or their carer or healthcare professional first.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="10030162000018"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked about the training courses, in particular ESOL, and mandation. We are confident that there will be a sufficient number of courses available and we are working closely with providers to ensure that good-quality courses will be available to these customers. ESOL and basic literacy courses will be separate and mandated customers will have a training allowance. The noble Baroness also referred to the WCA. The WCA is a more accurate assessment of limited capability for work, looking at what a person can do as well as what they cannot. On 19 January, there was an official publication of WCA national statistics. Figures showed that, for all ESA claims in the quarter from March 2009 to the end of May 2009, 38 per cent were assessed as fit for work, 5 per cent as suitable for the support group and 12 per cent as suitable for the work-related activity group. The remaining 45 per cent either left ESA before the completion of the assessment or their assessment is still in progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="10030162000021"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, talked about the training on offer in trial areas. To be clear, we want to maximise the take-up of the existing provision to ensure that there is a wide range of training for customers. No new training provision has been procured. The type of provision that is being offered to customers in the pilot encompasses employability skills, as we have discussed; work-focused training; short job-focused training for up to eight weeks; other job-related provision, which is available through further education and other LSC providers; ESF-funded provision; and DWP contract support.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="10030162000022"></a>Courses will be responsive to customers' individual needs, while suitability for those courses will be based on the training being appropriate to meet individuals' and employers' skills needs and being flexible enough to meet individuals' personal circumstances-it can be part time or full time. However, customers will not be required to attend training for more hours than they are available for employment or for more hours than the total number of hours for which they are available, as recorded in their jobseeker's agreement. The training must also be available within a reasonable period. Generally, part-time training can be completed before the customer is due to enter the next stage of the Flexible New Deal if they are still unemployed at the 12-month point in their claim.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="10030162000023"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Morris, talked about the quality of training on offer. The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for managing performance in the FE sector and works closely with Ofsted, which is responsible for inspecting and reporting on the quality of all adult education and training services.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="10030162000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, referred to past office closures and asked whether we were going to resource this properly. I smiled a little when that question came up, because we have debated on a number of occasions the support that the Government did not have from her Benches when we put £5 billion into capacity for Jobcentre Plus and into the programmes that have helped to address the challenges of the economic circumstances. I think that she said that we were in the midst of a recession, but she will be aware that some of the surveys out there show that there were signs of positive growth in the last quarter of last year.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="10030162000025"></a>Just to be clear, the programme of office closures has been suspended for the time being. Past closures of customer-facing Jobcentre Plus offices took into account a range of issues, such as the impact that the closure might have on customer service and whether the work and staff could be relocated. Our customers, partner organisations, trade union staff and local Members of Parliament are fully consulted when these things are under consideration.</p>

They will also refer customers to the adult advancement and careers service for more in-depth analysis.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="10030162000027"></a>The noble Baroness also talked about data sharing and data security. That is a very important point. Systems and processes are already in place to ensure that customers' personal information between Jobcentre Plus and providers is exchanged in a secure environment in accordance with the current information risk management guidance from the Cabinet Office.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="10030162000028"></a>I think that it was the noble Baroness who also asked about the definition of a job outcome. We are looking for sustainable job outcomes and will need to develop the evaluation strategy to reflect this.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="10030162000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, talked about the quality of training on offer. The LSC is responsible, as I said, for managing the FE sector. We will provide motivational courses to deal with customers who may be unwilling to co-operate before we move on to the main provisions. That is a route for helping people into the provision.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="10030162000030"></a>Early evaluation indicated that customers in the IES trial areas welcomed the intervention. Many said that they had a warm and supportive relationship with their next-step advisers and appreciated receiving independent, professional, one-to-one advice. Advisers encouraged customers to think about new ideas and helped to reignite their self-belief and motivation to progress. As the trials have been running for more than 12 months and processes are in place, we are confident that these skills pilots have a good foundation on which to develop-in fact, partnerships have continued to improve despite considerable pressure on services due to the recession.</p>

<a name="100301-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="10030162000031"></a>I want to make it clear that the skills support can be part of the jobseeker's agreement, but it is more likely to be included in the action plan, which I accept has an element that can be enforced, a point that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, was probing. He said that personal advisers need to spend time with jobseekers. We have implemented a new JSA regime, in which advisers have much greater flexibility to spend more time with jobseekers, dependent on need, from the six-month point.</p>

However, it goes to the heart of the Bill and my concerns about the Bill. I appreciate, as others have also said earlier in the debate, that the Government have come forward with a number of amendments that reflect the fact that they listened to what was said in Committee about the inadequacies of some of the procedure. They have particularly improved the early parts-stage 1 of the procedure-for which I am very grateful that. I declare my interest, if I have not already done so, as chair of Consumer Focus.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="10030162000035"></a>From the view of the subscribers and those who use digital access to copyrighted material of various forms, this appears to be a seriously draconian Bill. It seems to demonstrate a spirit that is very different from the general tone of <I>Digital Britain</I> and the Government's general approach to developing the digital economy. In those, the Government are in favour of accessibility, inclusion, innovation and competition. In the Bill-in Clauses 4 to 16 and perhaps in Clause 17 as well-we go straight into what is effectively a sanctions regime which is protectionist, which will lead to exclusion if it is successful, and which is likely to alienate a significant number of consumers, particularly young consumers, of digital services for music and for other forms of digitalised copyrighted material such as sport, drama and so on.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="10030162000036"></a>This is bad business for the rights holders and bad politics for the Government. It is not sensible to alienate a whole generation-unless you are giving an alternative. The Government have an alternative, and occasionally they talk about it. This apparently innocuous motherhood-and-apple-pie clause which I am proposing in Amendment 17 says that the Bill's objective is not to knock on the head as many unlawful file-sharers as you can find but to shift the burden of file-sharing transactions from the unlawful market in copyright  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1280"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>material to lawful means of access. There are lawful means of access. About half of those who admit to unlawful file-sharing also have some access to lawful forms of file-sharing. Quite well known, generalised new business models are coming on line: we have mentioned Spotify here before, but there are others. There are 20-odd quite general forms of relatively cheap, relatively accessible and relatively flexible ways of getting at most copyrighted material. It ought to be the Government's objective in their policy to move the bulk of this market to those lawful forms of access. Instead, propaganda on the Bill from the Government, and particularly from the music industry, is about clamping down, restricting and ultimately having sanctions that are disproportionate to the offence.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="10030162000037"></a>It would help to enhance the acceptability of this general approach among consumers and consumer organisations if the Government recognised that their objective is to move people to lawful forms of access. We would then be dealing with what should be a reducing problem. At the end of all that, there will of course still be some who engage in unlawful file-sharing. However, their number will probably be reduced provided that the lawful service is reasonably cheap and flexible. They will probably largely be people who are making significant money out of illegal file-sharing, or people who are manic, mega-serial infringers. We will still need measures to deal with them.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="10030162000038"></a>I would have preferred a strategy from the Government that recognises that it will take time to move the bulk of these transactions into a lawful market. This strategy would recognise that serious sanctions are still needed but that they do not necessarily have to involve going through the kind of procedures that we were talking about under the present system-the threats from lawyers and court action. It would, however, deal with the residual problem.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="10030162000039"></a>Perhaps I may underline the problem that one faces with consumers at the moment. Consumer Focus has recently conducted a small survey of people's understanding of these matters. Three-quarters of consumers know that they do not understand what is lawful and what is unlawful. We took three transactions which are actually unlawful, one of which is copying a CD or DVD which you have bought to another format so that you have a copy in more than one location. Three-quarters of people believe that that is legal. One-quarter recognises that it might be unlawful, and 86 per cent do not believe that it should be unlawful. You get similar results on similar format shifting.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="10030162000040"></a>With this level of ignorance of the law, and with consumers adapting to the new technology rather faster than institutions and businesses, it is not surprising that the threat of intervention-a temporary closing-down, throttling, suspension or reduction of internet connections in order to enforce that-meets with significant hostility. We should go back to a strategy that is aimed at moving everybody onto a lawful system, and which emphasises that, rather than the burden of this Bill, in which we now have 17 or 18 clauses on sanctions. It includes nothing about a lawful system, nothing about support for the creative industries and nothing about making access easier and more flexible.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1281"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="10030162000041"></a>The Government ought to think about re-presenting the Bill and their strategy in that regard. A small step in that direction at this stage in the Bill would be to put an objectives clause at the beginning of the Bill, before going into the sanctions sections. There may be better ways of drafting this clause, and I would be delighted if the Government came up with better ways of drafting it. However, it would be a small but significant step in making their whole approach rather more palatable than it is to me at the moment.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="10030162000042"></a>I therefore hope that the Government, if not immediately grabbing this opportunity tonight, will think that there is some merit in spelling it out here, and that there is some merit in re-presenting what they are doing. In the long run, it would be of benefit to the rights holders as well as to consumers and the Government. That is the intention of this clause, and it is pretty central to the strategy for the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I have been enormously influenced during the Bill's passage by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and by several things that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has said. I want to make a point that is, certainly to me, terribly important. I have learnt one thing during the Bill's passage-the absolute indispensability of pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill has suffered grievously from not having been scrutinised by a group of the entire Chamber.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="10030162000044"></a>I have been privileged to chair two pre-legislative scrutiny committees. What actually happens is that a relatively small group of people from all sides of the House sits down, goes through the evidence and interrogates it. It finds the areas on which it agrees and then offers solutions to the Government that we hope not only are palatable but move the process on. One of the more dispiriting features of the seven days that we spent in Committee was how much of the time was spent arguing over and discussing things that could so easily have been dealt with by a small group of peers from all parts of the House. If there is one great lesson to take away, it is that the House should not accept Bills like this without provision for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="10030162000045"></a>In that sense, I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. What will end up leaving this Chamber-probably lacking Clause 17, which in many respects is a pity, although I understand the objections to it-and going to the Commons is a Bill that none of us is particularly proud of. It will be a spatchcock that does part of the work it was intended to do but not all of it. I am absolutely convinced that, within the next two or three years, there will be another Bill before this House which will be created to deal with the deficiencies of the present Bill.</p>

Without having that objective clearly in the Bill, I am worried that some of the resources that should be going into educating the public will be lacking. The Minister will be well aware that the Government's rollout of their programme that now appears on the edge of our hotmail and other places -the zip it, block it, flag it-is exactly the sort of educational programme that should have preceded measures like this by a good year or 18 months. Only in that way can we start to get the message through to the generation that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, talked about. The Government have got it the wrong way round. They should have run the educational campaign, measured whether it had had sufficient impact, except against serial offenders who do it for commercial gain, and then introduced the sort of measures aimed exactly at them rather than the occasional downloader or the institutions that we shall no doubt be discussing later.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="10030162000048"></a>It is a pity that the Government did not commence their educational campaign well before bringing in these measures. I can understand why they have introduced this Bill now; they want to hurry it through before the election, which is understandable, but the necessity for the educational campaign has been known for a long time. It is a pity that they have not embarked on it. What resources will the Government be allocating now for an educational campaign based on what the public need to know about what is and what is not legal? I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, included the results of his survey because it highlights the need for the Government to have a quick and comprehensive campaign on the issue.</p>

For example, I get e-mails from a company called 3B Software which offers for a small annual sum of about £30 unlimited access to television stations round the world and to as many films as I want to watch. If I am paying, is it legal? I do not know. I do not know whether if I took the offer from that company it would be legal. I would be paying for it but I do not know whether the company has the copyright on the films or television programmes that it is offering.</p>

I was going to refer to the present but I am not sure whether the clauses are about the present; they are more about the past, and they certainly do not take account of the future. I have Virgin Media at my home in Hamilton in Scotland and I can get 50 megabytes broadband. By the end of this year I will be offered 100 megabytes broadband, which will allow me to stream-not download-HD quality television or film direct on to the computer. Noble Lords may ask who wants to watch a film on computer, but if I can wireless it to my television set I will be streaming. Again, I am not sure whether watching a streamed film is legal as opposed to downloading a film which is illegal. I hope that somebody can enlighten me on that.</p>

Some pop people have woken up to the fact that they cannot make money in that way, because of illegal downloading and the rest of it; they sell their music direct to customers on the internet. You download the piece of music and you pay them for it. You do not go through a music publisher or whatever. Pop stars now recognise that they no longer make their money from selling records; they make their money from the records publicising their concert tours and by appearing live in concert. That is the way in which it has gone. My noble friend is quite right. We have to look forward to see how on earth we can ensure-because I think quite rightly that those who produce artistic goods should be paid for them-that we can do that without penalising those who are not sure whether they are dealing with legal or illegal matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="10030162000053"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, hit the nail on the head-we should have done the educational campaign first. This amendment is about sending out a message, which is a good point. However, if you look at it, Clauses 4 to 9 are about sending out a message-sending out the letters. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, said, this is trying to do the education, but we are a bit late. Clauses 10 to 14 are the punitive bits-the cracking of the whip. Then we have the bit about how we divvy up the charges, and some administrative stuff. We are told by the Minister that all those clauses are about sending a message. That message is not a very kind message in the way that it has been phrased in this Bill, which we expect to become an Act.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="10030162000054"></a>It would be much nicer to put this up front, so that people realise that there is a desirable purpose in this and that it is not a hostile Act the entire way through. I refer to the discussion of the previous three amendments, which were all about using an existing system of remedy which exists for the rights holders, and which is not to be removed from them. This is a very effective way of dealing with serious offenders. Take them to court-why not? We do not want to remove that from them. We understand from both front benches that we need to leave this remedy in the Bill.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="10030162000055"></a>If we are going to leave this remedy for a crackdown on serious offenders through the civil courts, you start to wonder, "Why do we need this new method?".

This sounds a bit illogical, I am afraid, and it may sound slightly muddled, but it is not. What message are we are trying to get out? At the moment, it is very muddled. On the one hand, we are leaving in place all the existing remedies for serious offenders, which could be used right now, and now we are putting a whole lot of things in-to frighten minor offenders, I presume-because they are presumably not necessary for major offenders. I therefore think that this clause is essential to explain why we are doing it, and what we are really trying to do for the future. Without it, this Bill, to be honest, will be ridiculed.</p>

I listened carefully to my noble friend Lord Whitty. I can understand the use of a bit of hyperbole to make a case, but to say that we are moving straight into a protectionist regime and sanctions is a misconception and an unreasonable description of what we have spent many days discussing. We were adopting an educationist and gradualist approach. We are not doing anything threatening. We would send out a very modest advisory letter, which was exaggerated. As regards saying that we are moving into protectionist technical measures, we are not doing that. It would take a year before we would even consider them, which would be after an Ofcom report. As on many occasions, I plead for a more measured analysis of what we are trying to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="10030162000057"></a>To address the noble Baroness, those letters are part of the educational campaign. I am afraid that I cannot follow the logic or rationale of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, who wants to take everyone to court now. I thought that we were moving away from that. He said that we do not need this and that we could just use the measures. Millions of people are engaging in peer-to-peer file sharing, as we have discussed on numerous occasions. We know that in many cases these people do it because they think that that is what we do on the internet. We know that there is a need for an educational process for those people, which is why we have adopted this gradualist approach.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="10030162000058"></a>On several occasions, we have made it clear that the reason for this part of the Bill is to reduce significantly the level of online infringement of copyright, not just because widespread unlawful activity should not be condoned but, I should like to stress, because we see it as a vital ingredient in doing what my noble friend Lord Whitty wants; that is, to develop a flourishing and sustainable digital economy where people gain the fruits of their labours. My noble friend Lord Maxton also seemed to think that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="10030162000059"></a>As to whether streaming is legal, it depends on what it is used for. There can be legal and illegal examples of streaming. Where a streaming service is licensed by the rights owner, it is legal. Most iPlayer viewing is streaming. But unlicensed streaming will not be legal. I cannot pronounce on the services for which my noble friend is paying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="10030162000060"></a>Alongside enforcement, which properly remains at the heart of the responsibility of the owner of the copyright, has to be education, with which I agree, and

There are quite a few legal alternatives out there. It is not as though there are not any. We constantly talk about an environment in which there are no legal alternatives. It is just that the illegal alternative has become an attractive first option and changing that will take a bit of time and education. That is exactly why we will not move into sanctions early on.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="10030162000061"></a>However, while the Government's purpose is very clear, there is no need to include a new clause as proposed by the amendment. The clauses speak for themselves in terms of their effect, which includes elements within the progress reports produced by Ofcom that will track the efforts of copyright owners to ensure that they play their part in this. We are not expecting copyright owners to go down just one route, but also to develop the alternative. The proposed new clause would have no effect and we believe it to be unnecessary.</p>

<a name="100301-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="10030162000062"></a>As to the contribution from my noble friend Lord Puttnam, with whom I usually find myself in agreement, in an ideal world perhaps we would subject this Bill to pre-legislative scrutiny. But I can recall some of my noble friends and Ministers telling me that, even where we have had pre-legislative scrutiny, it has not stopped hundreds of amendments-as though there is a process of collective amnesia. I would not decry it because I can see the benefit of what my noble friend has suggested. Where perhaps I disagree slightly is the description that this process of scrutiny is a spatchcock. Of course, it will change. We have submitted dozens of our own amendments. Why? Because we are reflecting the genuine concerns of the House. However, that does not mean that the essential structure of the Bill and what it is trying to achieve will not emerge at the end of this process. With or without Clause 17, it still has a very important purpose. I see I have spurred my noble friend-</p>

My point is that as a House-and I certainly speak for myself-we have been subjected to an extraordinary degree of lobbying. The problem is that we have had no opportunity to look at that lobbying in a sensible and interrogative way and decide which of it is valid and reasonable and which is pure hyperbole. That is what has been missing. Many of us in this House have come in having just had our ears bashed-either by the record industry or some other aspect of special pleading. The House has not been protected with a proper interrogative process by which we, as Members of the House, can come to this Chamber fully cognisant of the things we have looked at and believe we can advance on. The lobbying process that has gone into this Bill has been quite destructive and has done none of us very much help at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="10030162000067"></a>My noble friend Lord Puttnam is very wise to say that this should have been subject to effective pre-legislative scrutiny. My noble friend the Minister is also very wise not to give my noble friend Lord Maxton any detailed legal advice-he might find himself in serious trouble if he did. That illustrates the problem: people do not understand it. As my noble friend Lord Maxton told us, he has been an aficionado of this area for at least two decades, possibly more, and he does not know whether he is operating legally or not.</p>

My noble friend the Minister says that education is the first part of this Bill. I have said the Government have made improvements to the first part of the Bill-roughly Clauses 4 to 7-but it is still the first stage of an enforcement process. The first letter a subscriber gets is, "It appears that an infringement has taken place". That is not education. It may turn out that he will learn something from it, but it is not education. It is a threat. The problem with this approach is that it is a serious threat. Part of the music industry and other industries have behaved in a gung-ho way: they have the Government and indeed the Opposition on side to wipe out this problem by getting the ISPs to do it for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="10030162000070"></a>It would have been far better for all concerned, including consumers, if we had had a proper education process up front, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has said. If we had explained the situation and given support and marketing to the lawful process, we might have persuaded some of the lawful processes to market themselves rather more effectively. I do not suggest that we go down the road that President Sarkozy now appears to be going down. Recognising that his approach, which is similar to this one, ain't going to work, he has now decided to subsidise the purchase of hardware in terms of CDs and DVDs at some expense to the French taxpayer. I am not suggesting we do the same here. But at least he has recognised that simply intervening on the sanctions side will not work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="10030162000071"></a>This is a graduated approach, but we should first inform and educate.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="10030162000118"></a>"This section applies if it appears to a copyright owner that ...a subscriber to an internet access service has infringed the owner's copyright by means of the service".</p>

<p><a name="10030162000109"></a>We had lengthy debates in Committee about the fact that the subscriber may well not be the perpetrator of the infringement and how you identify where the real issue lies. A more neutral approach to that in the text of the Bill which says that a subscriber has infringed would be to use my terminology and say that it appears that an,</p>
<ul><a name="10030162000127"></a>"infringement of the owner's copyright has taken place through a subscriber's IP address".</ul>
<p><a name="10030162000110"></a>That is actually a more accurate description of how it would be brought to the attention of the copyright holder and the ISP. It would be a rather softer approach by the Government and might help to turn those first notification letters into a slightly more educational and less threatening tool. I hope that the Government will accept that this is a sensible modification of the approach. It does nothing else to change the Government's intention. I hope that at least consideration will be given to this alternative wording. I beg to move.</p>

The hotel will presumably be subject to the proceedings established by the initial obligations code. Is it expected to communicate with former guests about these obligations?

All that the copyright owner will see is an apparent infringement taking place-I stress an apparent infringement taking place-at a particular date and time, via a specific IP address. They will not know the circumstances because they will not know who it is. In many ways the reason for this legislation is to allow the copyright holder to take action that connects information about the infringement to the subscriber responsible for the connection while maintaining anonymity.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="10030162000078"></a>However, while agreeing that this is what happens in practice, the text that the amendment proposes to delete is useful. It makes clear that it may not be the subscriber that is personally responsible for the infringement and as such also makes it plain that, in those circumstances, the provisions continue to apply-although of course we have listened to what noble Lords said in Committee and have made it much clearer how subscribers can deal with that. In fact, we have sent a lot of information out to that effect.</p>

<p><a name="10030162000111"></a>which is not an accurate description, as we have said on a number of occasions. The IP address is dynamic, generally speaking, changing each time a subscriber logs on, while the amendment implies a fixed point of contact.

No doubt his technical advisers can advise him on a more apposite wording to replace the subscriber's address. However, that is not the point of the amendment. The point is that it does not imply-the wording of the Bill does imply this-the clear guilt of the subscriber, either by perpetrating the infringement themselves or by giving permission-actively or passively-to somebody else to do it.

I will also respond to the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that cover the same ground.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="10030162000086"></a>There was some interesting debate in Committee around the extent to which we should leave the detail of the process to the code, which would have the benefit of direct stakeholder input and consultation, and how much should be included in the Bill to ensure a minimum level of protection for subscribers. While the Government continue to see merit in leaving much detail to the code, we listened to the arguments made and the amendments laid by the Government are the result.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="10030162000087"></a>The amendments we have put forward in the area of notifications and time limits do, I suggest, strike the right balance. They ensure that subscribers who receive a notification have the information that they need in order to appeal if necessary, that the first-level notification does not include information about potential technical measures, underlining the advisory nature of the letter-I hope that noble Lords found the illustrative letters helpful in that regard-and let the subscriber know what the position is generally as regards issues such as potential legal action by copyright owners.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="10030162000088"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will also have noted that we have adopted his proposal of including provision for the name of the copyright owner making the report to be included in the notification, and I hope that as a result he will agree to withdraw his own amendment in this area. However, we do not agree with his Amendment 28, which proposes that marketing information may also be sent with notifications, not because we do not agree with it but because in our view there is nothing to stop such information being sent as it is-and in practice we would be rather surprised if it was not. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, can agree to withdraw that amendment also. Certainly, we wholeheartedly agree with the underlying point that copyright owners must step up and play their part by ensuring that there is plenty of attractive legitimate content available.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="10030162000089"></a>These amendments also set limits on how long the process can take, with a maximum of a month allowed between the date evidence of the apparent infringement is gathered and the copyright infringement report being sent to the internet service provider, and the same period being set as the limit between a copyright infringement report being received and a notification being sent to a subscriber. That may be regarded by some in industry as challenging, but there is a balance to be struck here and we think this is only fair to subscribers-of course, we hope and expect the actual period to be considerably shorter than this.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="10030162000090"></a>I hope noble Lords agree that this moves this part of the Bill in the right direction and recognise that we took account of a number of serious points that were made in the previous debate. I beg to move.</p>

I am also grateful for the Minister's words on Amendment 28, which very much answer the case. I shall pick up his words at a later moment because it does seem to me very important that the industry offers ISPs something that they can sell to their customers. They must have a product to offer in substitute for what their customers are doing at the moment. This is an enormous marketing opportunity.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="10030162000092"></a>At the moment, the copyright owners are being extremely difficult, as I said at the last stage, about a test of this in one particular area, to see whether an ISP can successfully offer rights packages to its users-which has been successful in Denmark, for goodness sake, so why are they dragging their feet here? However, at least the Government say that they are expecting the industry to do this. I very much hope the industry is listening and that, when the time comes to send out these letters, there will not be an ISP in the land which is unable to offer a legitimate package to its subscribers, presumably for a cut of the take in doing so.</p>

I think the Minister has made significant progress and improvements to the Bill as a result of these amendments.</p>

The very language that the Minister uses is wrong, and I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, did not choose to call a vote; but I can understand why he did not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="10030162000095"></a>I rise to make a point that BT has made to us in its briefing. Quite clearly, it is still deeply unhappy, despite all of the government amendments. I wonder whether the Minister is aware of the depth of its unhappiness. I must say that I have never found it in the past to be an organisation that has been anything other than reasonable and logical. BT says that,</p>
<ul><a name="10030162000129"></a>"it is not clear which of the definitions of 'subscriber' or 'internet service provider' would apply to account holders such as businesses, organisations and householders whose internet connections are or can be used to provide internet access for many people".</ul>
<p><a name="10030162000112"></a>It feels that the new amendments that the Government are introducing at this stage are not much more than cosmetic. I wonder what consultations the Government have had with BT and whether it came up with some more substantial suggestions that the Government have chosen to ignore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="10030162000097"></a>We submitted the amendments in good faith in the light of the serious points that had been made in previous debates and, from other points that have been made around the House, it is obvious that they serve a purpose.

We are still talking about the initial letter of notification and the evidence that is required to issue such a notification. I know that the Minister was getting a bit irritated with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, but such a notice suggests that we are moving into sanctions, and for sanctions you need to differentiate motivation in the long run.</p>

<a name="100301-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="10030162000100"></a>This is the beginning of a process. It may be a light-touch beginning but, in the end, if compliance is not achieved, we are into sanctions in stage 2. Therefore, if evidence is being gathered at this early stage, it is useful to identify the motivation of the unlawful downloader or file-sharer. I simply suggest in the amendment that, if there is an allegation that the individual is making money out of this breach of copyright, that should be known at the earliest possible stage. That will then have consequences regarding the nature of any sanction if there is continuous non-compliance at a later stage. That seems to me very sensible and it is a way of sorting those who are currently engaged in unlawful file-sharing from the eventual hard core whom this regime will have to tackle.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100301-0016.htm"/>


<a name="100301-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="10030162000101"></a>The amendment may not be in quite the form that the Minister would like but it would provide a useful differentiation and would be a useful addition to the background evidence for the first intervention. It would imply that not everyone was as guilty as everyone else in this respect. In other words, if you were making money from unlawful file-sharing, ultimately you would expect a heavier sanction if you did not comply than if you were a casual user. It is sensible to establish that at the beginning and I hope that the Minister will at least have a look at the possibility of including such an amendment. I beg to move.</p>

Online infringement of copyright through the unlawful use of peer-to-peer file-sharing networks is a civil matter where there is widespread sharing of copyrighted material without any remuneration involved either to those sharing the files or, alas, to the owners and creators of the copyrighted material. As I have said before, moving towards any sanctions is quite a long process. They are taken only against serial infringers and therefore someone would have to have quite a track record before any sanctions were taken. It must be remembered that we were talking about not even introducing technical measures until at least a year after we had seen whether the gradualist, educated process had had any effect. I am going to keep returning to this so that we do not create the impression that sanctions are going be taken against people in a very short time-that is not the case.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="10030162000104"></a>On the substance of what my noble friend is trying to do-and I understand the direction of travel-it is extremely difficult for copyright owners to address such widespread activity, which is why we have introduced the provisions in this part of the Bill. In many ways, it  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1294"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is easier and simpler when there is money involved since, if somebody is making money from copyright infringement, it becomes a criminal offence and a different set of procedures comes into play. There is also a clear target and, as in the simple instruction to detectives, the same thing would apply to enforcement authorities-"follow the money". That is not what we are talking about here. Peer-to-peer file-sharing is not necessarily about people making money out of it; it just happens to be that what they are doing is illegal. So it would be pointless and even misleading to add this to the list of notifications information. I hope, in the light of that explanation, that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The consequences, for somebody who is doing it for money will, as the Minister rightly says, be potentially different. This does not say that you have to distinguish, for everybody, beyond doubt that money is involved, but if there is, as part of the knowledge of the copyright holder, an assertion that money is involved, we might as well get it on the record as early in the process as possible. That is all that Amendment 26 is doing.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="10030162000106"></a>When we come on to the next stages, it seems rather more necessary that we know before we engage in the technical measures sanctions, or indeed, put it into the criminal system, as my noble friend the Minister implied. While it may not be absolutely necessary to know at this point, it will be necessary and helpful to know at some point whether they are involved, not simply in depriving the copyright owner of money, but actually making money for themselves. That distinction will have to feed through to the sanctions regime, but for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I shall also speak to Amendments 36, 37 and 40, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Razzall, Lord Clement-Jones and Lord Whitty, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, which also address the thresholds that apply in Clause 6.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="1003023000002"></a>Perhaps the most important of the amendments laid by the Government in this group has the effect of removing the text that caused some concern to noble Lords during both Second Reading and Committee. The concern was about whether it was fair or reasonable to require internet service providers to process copyright infringement reports that accrued to them during the qualifying period-in other words, before they were formally subject to the obligations. Internet service providers put forward the scenario of being obliged to spend significant sums just in case, at some time, the obligations did apply to them. This would in many cases be likely to be wasted money. Clearly that is not in anyone's interests, and the amendments allow for the obligations to apply from when the qualifying threshold is reached, or from a later date.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="1003023000003"></a>The other amendments in this group are largely intended to clarify the position regarding thresholds, including how the thresholds for going on the copyright infringement list might be constructed-for example, allowing for time as well as simply the numbers of copyright infringement reports to be taken into account when looking at thresholds for adding subscribers to a copyright infringement list. These amendments are again in response to the concerns expressed during our deliberations in Committee, and I hope that noble Lords will agree that they address one unintended consequence and provide greater clarity elsewhere without hindering the important flexibility that the code provides in setting the thresholds themselves.</p>

It remains our view that the code is the right place for the threshold to be established. I believe that we can rely on the parties with the most interest in getting this right and on Ofcom, as an experienced regulator, to agree a suitable threshold.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="1003023000005"></a>That is also our view of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and my noble friend Lord Whitty. I do not think that we would be at all wise to include specific figures for any threshold in the Bill; that is for the code. In passing, I would say that if a threshold of 50 is included, there might be few internet service providers left outside the scope. Whether that is desirable and effective I am content to leave to the code.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="1003023000006"></a>Finally, the noble Lords, Lord Razzall and Lord Clement-Jones, suggested that once the threshold has been reached a reasonable time should be allowed for internet service providers to prepare. I agree that this needs to be part of the practical arrangements. Your Lordships will therefore not be completely surprised when I suggest that this sort of practical detail is best left to the code. The outline that we made available in Committee included that eventuality. In trying to put more flesh on the bones of what the code may look like, we think it important that, while not taking away flexibility, we provide a period of consultation for stakeholders to decide the make-up the code.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="1003023000007"></a>I am sure that noble Lords noted that Amendment 39 allows that internet service providers comply with the obligations once they have passed the threshold or at a later time. This was included specifically to cater for the likely but not certain need of many internet service providers to make the necessary preparations. We took into account many of the comments and concerns expressed in previous debates and they have been reflected in the government amendments. In the  light of those comments, I hope that noble Lords  will not press their amendments. In the mean time, I beg to move.</p>

However, he has saved me having to make a long speech, or indeed much of a speech at all. I thank him for responding to Amendments 36 and 40 essentially in the same terms. He said that rather keep it in the Bill, it should be in the code. One needs to consider the impact of that. It will not be quite as powerful, particularly in terms of Amendment 40, which gives internet service providers a reasonable time, because there are two ways in which these codes can be made. They are either made by consent or imposed by Ofcom. Perhaps the Minister is saying that if Amendment 40 is not included in the code by agreement between the parties, it will be imposed by Ofcom. That is the only way in which something that the Minister assures us will be in the code, but which is not specified in the Bill, is in the code. In a sense, one is taking it somewhat on trust. However, at this stage of the proceedings, and given the Minister's assurances, I shall take the matter away and consider his response to Amendments 36 and 40.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="1003023000013"></a>There are two aspects to this amendment. The first deals with the precautions that a customer will be asked to take. If the Minister has looked at the latest <I>Which? Computing</I>, he will see that domestic routers are reviewed-and, indeed, that the model that I have is found to be fundamentally insecure, as is the model that I had previously. I bought mine at PC World, as it was one of the nicest looking ones around and did everything that was required of it. The only one that came out as totally secure was the BT router, which you cannot buy unless you have a BT account-which I do not, at least not in the relevant place.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="1003023000014"></a>Being told that these particular brands of router will do what you want to do, and that this is what you do, is better than just being told, "Go and buy a router that complies", without leaving it absolutely clear which those are. Most people who are subject to these things will not feel technically confident and will need precise instructions. That especially applies to people who want to know how to defend themselves against an accusation. I have lived the past 40 years with computers of one form or another, and I would not know how to defend myself against an accusation that I had file-shared. How would I get proof? To give somebody a kit that they can use is going to be essential. I beg to move.</p>

However, it attempts to do so by placing new obligations on Ofcom in areas in which Ofcom does not have the necessary expertise or experience. In doing so, it would actually reduce the level of subscriber protection. I will say why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="1003023000019"></a>We agree that advice should be made available to subscribers on how to secure their networks, but the best people to give it are the ISPs, which can advise on what works best on their network, using their hardware, and on the type of service that they provide. I stress  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1299"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we are introducing an amendment to the Bill that requires that they do so under the code. Any advice from Ofcom would be second best. However, it will be up to the appeals body, the First-tier Tribunal, or indeed a court, to decide what precautions or evidence may or may not be appropriate. In a lot of the information that we have sent out, we have said what we think would be a reasonable defence for people adopting security measures. I will have to come back to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on the question of security on routers and so on; I do not feel capable of giving an answer here.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="1003023000020"></a>The danger in Ofcom setting out its views on what measures are "reasonable" or what evidence might be produced is that these could become the de facto minimum for subscribers, regardless of circumstance or effectiveness. The level of technical expertise that is required-for example, to demonstrate that at no time did the subscriber's computer have the necessary software to allow infringement-is fairly high and expensive, although it is easy to envisage circumstances in which this would be totally unnecessary. In such a fast-changing area, any centrally provided advice that tried to cover all eventualities could very quickly date. Conversely, a court or tribunal might simply take the view that the measures were unnecessary or inadequate and not take them into account.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="1003023000021"></a>We agree with the intent behind these amendments, but, as I have explained, we feel strongly that they are not necessary and that, for once, Ofcom is not best placed to provide the advice.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="1003023000022"></a>There are a number of reliable and credible sources of advice on protecting networks on computers outside the ISPs, such as www.getsafeonline.org, which provides independent advice on how to protect networks and is supported by government, Ofcom, the police and industry. Organisations such as <I>Which?</I> also review widely available security products. I will still take away the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, about routers, which apparently are not secure. He asked whether software programs could in any way be downloaded to make them secure. I do not know.</p>

<a name="100301-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="1003023000023"></a>We understand exactly and sympathise with where the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is coming from, but we do not believe that this is the right way to proceed.

Amendment 33 is pretty straightforward-it just requires the code to cover the subsequent stipulations, rather than have a form of words based on "may".

However, it also covers the wider issues that were raised during the Committee stage.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100301-0017.htm"/>


<a name="100301-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="1003023000028"></a>It seems that the code needs to specify a number of things in relation to those bodies and organisations that feel they have particular problems with the operation of the regime that this Bill requires. In particular, we have had very substantial representations from libraries and educational establishments. The Minister helpfully provided a factsheet on how this would impact on libraries in particular. The factsheet is helpful, but it indicates that there is a very wide range of issues, and clarity of advice is not very easily available, depending on the nature of the systems that are operating in the libraries and the protocols under which they operate, and the other public institutions with which they liaise and share information. It is not therefore that straightforward, even for libraries.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="1003023000029"></a>I suggest that those non-profit-making bodies and educational establishments ought not to be subject to the same sanctions, and therefore the same warning procedure, that is implied for other people. That does not mean that they are not covered, and that copyright is not protected in relation to such institutions, but it does mean that separate protocols will have to be developed, in order that those bodies that effectively exist in order to provide for multiple users, in educational establishments and elsewhere, at no profit to themselves, can have some separate arrangement. That will probably be negotiated with the rights holders and will protect their position, while at the same time giving some return to the rights holders. They are not in the same position as either individuals or commercial businesses who are engaged in unlawful file-sharing. They are in a position where they are trying to do what I was emphasising in an earlier stage in this debate; that is, to spread the availability of information and of creative works on the internet to a wider range of people. That is the function of educational establishments and libraries-that is their job-and we therefore need to make special provision for them.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="1003023000030"></a>At this stage in the evening, I will not say much about those other organisations that are commercial, but which also exist primarily to give access to other people: cybercafés and hotels-which the noble Lord,

Again, they are not in the same category as individual users or individual businesses.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="1003023000031"></a>The final phrase of Amendment 35 relates exactly to the territory that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, was referring to-namely that all users, all subscribers, need to have greater clarity about the precautions they are expected to take.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="1003023000032"></a>Amendment 76, which is also in this group, follows that through, so that where, in the later stages, under Clause 10 and onwards, a relevant subscriber has taken precautions, that shall be deemed "reasonable steps" under the formulation, and will provide the subscriber with a prima facie defence against sanctions at that later stage. I am not trying to do it in quite the same way as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and it may be that technically his way is better. However, the Government have already rejected that, so I am coming back to that fourth paragraph in Amendment 35, followed through in Amendment 76, to ensure that the code and the regulations under that code and the procedure will allow those who have taken reasonable precautions to escape the sanctions at the end of the day. That seems to me only sensible and equitable, and would of course apply in a court of law. Since at the moment this procedure is not going through a court of law-which I regret, but nevertheless it is not-then surely the same terms should apply.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="1003023000070"></a>This is a hotchpotch of amendments, and we have covered a number of different subjects all together, but I should like to hear the Government's position on making special provision for libraries and education establishments; on commercial operations which exist to share; and, if not tonight then at a later stage, on what precautions are "reasonable steps". I beg to move.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="1003023000034"></a>We had a good debate in Committee, but there was great sense of disappointment, I think, that libraries and universities were classified for the purposes of the code simply as subscribers. Such classification will make them migrate away from what might be thought as being their ordinary course of duty as a cultural or educational establishment towards becoming ISPs themselves. Ironically, they may have rather fewer duties as an ISP than as a subscriber. That would be a regrettable step, because one is forcing them into a situation which would not otherwise occur if there were satisfactory exemptions for them.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="1003023000035"></a>However, I accept that the Minister has within the constraints of the definitions that he has provided tried to be helpful. A paragraph in the note that he has sent noble Lords states:</p>

Nevertheless, the defences need to be set out very clearly in the codes, and we are not there yet.

Universities are relatively easy organisations to address, because they have a student body which can sign up to something. Similarly, in libraries, as you take out your library user card, you can be asked to sign up. However, we have not yet got to the bottom of what will happen to municipal places-the towns, for example-that choose to offer wi-fi. I am sad that the Government have not chosen to introduce a clause stating what category educational establishments or commercial establishments such as internet cafés, or indeed municipal facilities and wi-fi towns such as Swindon, would fall into. The vision set out by the Government in <I>Digital Britain</I> was of a place where local government provided wi-fi; it was creating opportunities for the citizen.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="1003023000037"></a>Not having a more enabling clause in this Bill that recognises how to get round some of the difficulties without making life difficult for those organisations and local governments who are being innovative seems to be a big loss. The Minister, I am sure, will be aware of the town in the USA-I believe in Ohio-which was offering wi-fi. It had a great difficulty because it was said that someone who had accessed the internet through the wi-fi had infringed copyright and the whole wi-fi network was threatened with closure. I do not know what happened in that case, but it would be a great shame if just at the point where we are getting more widespread opportunity to access wi-fi through municipal provision, it was caught by this Bill.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="1003023000038"></a>Establishments such as libraries and universities would benefit from a special clause, but I would be very grateful if the Minister could make a particular comment on municipal wi-fi.</p>

If for some reason-such as transport difficulties, heavy snow or a terrorist threat-you cannot get into work, you can work from some other access point that you happen to get to. You may get halfway there and then log in. That flexible, free and mobile future is, I think, where the world is going. I think it would be very sad if Britain, because of one particular challenge and problem which we need to solve, constrains itself in such a way that we lose that flexibility and end up with a whole lot of tied points, huge complexity and a lot of regulation preventing people doing anything. I envisage a nice, free world, not a world where we are heavily constrained, so therefore I very much support Amendment 35 and hope the Government will look at it very closely.</p>

As noble Lords will recall, the issue of libraries, universities and other establishments was the subject of much  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1303"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1303</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debate in Committee. We recognised the concerns raised and I wrote to the noble Lords who participated in last week's debate.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="1003023000041"></a>I therefore entirely appreciate the intention behind these amendments. No one wants to see libraries or universities the subject of court action or technical measures if-I stress this-they are ever introduced. There is no question of them being some sort of quick sanction which cuts off those services. No one wants to see legitimate businesses suffer as a consequence of the actions of their customers but, equally, it cannot be right that they are totally excluded from the provisions of the Bill. My noble friend Lord Puttnam, with his background in universities, recognised that essential point eloquently during our debate in Committee. It is better that the code recognises different circumstances; that is what the Government's amendments provide. Such an exclusion would, I believe, be counterproductive. It is important to remember that libraries and universities can and do ensure that their systems are used for the purposes for which they were already designed. After all, it does not help a university to have a lot of unlawful file-sharing going on when it needs the bandwidth for legitimate file-sharing of research data. They sit on infringement pretty hard when they detect it, and install systems to deter illegitimate use of what is, after all, a finite resource.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="1003023000042"></a>Libraries also take proportionate and reasonable measures on both fixed and wireless connections. All library services should have a conditions of use policy to which users have to agree before getting access to the network. For example, no unlawful activity, including copyright infringement, is permitted. The policy usually stipulates that legal liability for unlawful activities sits with the individual, not the library. There are measures that can be placed on wireless networks to either restrict access to sites or restrict use of certain technologies or protocols-for example, routing all traffic through a proxy server that did not support the use of particular technologies.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="1003023000044"></a>The Government recognised in Committee that more clarification on these issues was needed. We set out in the amendment that we discussed earlier today that more information should be made available to all types of subscribers on how to safeguard their connections. We proposed a new clause on subscriber appeals, which sets out that if the subscriber was not responsible for the infringement and-I stress-had taken reasonable steps to prevent others from infringing, the appeals body should rule in favour of the subscriber.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="1003023000045"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, would go further by requiring that steps that the subscriber could rely on taking should be set out in the initial obligations code. This is just not practicable. The code would be a relatively static document made by statutory instrument. The steps that might be appropriate to protect an internet connection could well change over time as new techniques are developed and may be different for different types of subscriber or different types of network.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="1003023000046"></a>We absolutely agree that subscribers should have some guidance on what steps can be taken, which is the reason for Amendments 25 and 27 in the name of  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1304"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my noble friend Lord Mandelson, which we have already discussed. These will require ISPs to provide such information as part of a notification and to take into account the suitability of different protection for subscribers in different circumstances. We do not think that it is possible to make following these steps a sufficient defence precisely because different steps may be appropriate for different subscribers. However, I would certainly expect the appeals body to regard evidence that the subscriber had followed steps recommended by their ISP as very strong evidence of having taken reasonable steps.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="1003023000047"></a>Finally, Amendment 33 would make the inclusion in the code of a provision for dealing with exceptional cases mandatory rather than something that, under the Bill, may be included. I do not think that making such a change is necessary. Of course it is important that the code should be flexible enough to deal with particular cases that do not necessarily conform to the usual pattern. That is why subsection (3) is there. It expressly recognises the need, and the actions that will be required of internet service suppliers and copyright owners, to ensure that any such conditions for dealing with cases of that sort are met. However, I see no reason for requiring such a provision before it is evident that there are such cases. Insisting on such a provision in these circumstances would be a complete waste of time. I suggest that the potential issue of dealing with particular cases effectively needs to be provided for; the current text does that. Making it a requirement for the code may be a wasted effort. In the light of that, I hope that the noble Lord can see his way to withdrawing the amendment.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="1003023000048"></a>I stress that it is our intention that the code should require ISPs to provide generic advice and information on how to tackle infringement as well as on how to protect a wireless connection/network and that such advice is appropriate for the type of establishment in question. We will add a requirement under Clause 8 that this is a provision that the code must include. I hope that that gives some reassurance.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="1003023000049"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, we gave an example of a case study on urban wi-fi-the Swindon example. I can tell the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that it is not our intention to stifle initiatives, but we believe that appropriate measures can be taken in all these circumstances. It is quite complicated but, given the time, I do not want to read out the Swindon case study, as it would not be appropriate. However, we believe that a type of free or coffee-shop access of a basic bandwidth service that offered users access to e-mail and web browsing would be unlikely to be the type of free broadband service that would be sufficient to support any file-sharing or that could be used for significant copyright infringement. The Swindon example is a two-tier service. One part of it is a restricted bandwidth, so it is unlikely that it could be used to engage in peer-to-peer activity. There is another paid-for subscription service where that might be possible, but I am sure that there will be conditions of use.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="1003023000050"></a>I commend the factsheet. I would not say that it answers every question but it goes a long way towards addressing these issues. We have tried to make sure that there will be some requirements-things that the

We believe that, in a situation where the technology changes frequently, we can meet the genuine concerns expressed. We have tried to strike a balance so that organisations such as universities, libraries and hotels have the ability to offer a service but are not exempt from taking the necessary measures and will not fall foul unreasonably, provided that they show that they have taken the necessary precautions. I hope that, in the light of the published information and my explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I accept that obviously you cannot cover every contingency. It is however important that the main classes of user understand what is required of them, and how the process will apply to them. This will be different, depending on the technology within those sub-classes. I was intending with Amendment 35 to go a little bit further than that; namely that the particular circumstances of libraries, and probably the particular circumstances of some hotels and cafes and so on, somehow need to be recognised as well.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="1003023000052"></a>Giving multiple access is part of their service. This goes to a rather more fundamental question of whether we should be legislating for fair use, but it seems to me that there could be particular provisions-deals done-with the ISP, or direct with the rights-holders, which recognise the particular circumstances of those who are providing multiple-use access. I will not pursue that any further tonight, but once this comes to be implemented, we will very rapidly see-as those industries themselves have warned us-that there will be impracticalities in their area if they are treated in the same way as any other subscriber. We have had approaches not only from libraries and colleges, but also from hotels and others who will need to be reassured on this point.</p>

The Minister has tried to reassure the House that ISPs and copyright owners will be expected to meet a high standard when setting up the databases and transferring information between them at the appropriate stage. As with so much in this Bill, however, it will not be possible to tell the value of these reassurances until the system has been established. It will provide considerable reassurances for subscribers, and indeed ISPs, which are likely to bear the brunt of consumer anger if these standards are not maintained, if the code were to be approved by the appropriate person-the Information Commissioner.

However, they are not necessary and would slow the adoption and approval of the code. A quick summary of the process that the code must go though will help to explain why. Ofcom will have either to develop or approve a code to underpin the initial obligations. It knows that any code must fully comply with existing legislation, including data protection and privacy, before it submits it to the Secretary of State. But before the code gets the Ofcom stamp of approval, it would have been developed with stakeholders and put out to consultation. The Information Commissioner's Office responded to our earlier consultations on online copyright infringement and I would expect it to be similarly involved in the code consultation, if not the code development process itself.</p>

<a name="100301-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="1003023000057"></a>The code then requires the approval of the Secretary of State before ultimately coming before Parliament for approval. As part of that process we must be sure that it complies with all legislation and not just that concerning data protection or privacy. Therefore, the code will have been developed with stakeholders, have gone through a consultation, had Ofcom approval, and had the Secretary's of State's approval and that of Cabinet colleagues before it reaches Parliament. It is hard to believe that in all that time the important issues of data protection and privacy would not have been fully investigated and checked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="1003023000058"></a>Finally, I have little doubt that before approving the code the Information Commissioner would want to consider or consult on it, thus elongating the approvals process further. Formally requiring the Information

Subsection (2)(b) of new Section 124D of the Communications Act 2003, "Initial obligations code by OFCOM in the absence of an approved code", refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="1003023000090"></a>"such longer period as the Secretary of State may specify by notice to OFCOM".</ul>
<p><a name="1003023000072"></a>The Minister was fairly cogent in terms of describing why a longer period was needed in terms of the standstill required by the technical standards directive and the standard Ofcom 12-week consultation period. It would appear that the whole process would take six months and, therefore, it was probably unreasonable to specify that the whole code could be produced within six months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="1003023000061"></a>However, what appears to be a good argument for having a longer deadline fails to justify what the Government's amendment in Committee did, which was potentially to remove the deadline altogether. That does not appear to be justified. There is considerable concern among some stakeholders involved that this process could be extended unreasonably and could prevent Ofcom getting code discussions moving on the ground that basically there is no longer a time limit. It seems sensible to reintroduce some form of deadline, which this amendment attempts to do. I beg to move.</p>

I am not in favour of unnecessary delays or time wasting; I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones.

This notification process requires that the member state submit the proposal in a near final form, and that the Commission and other member states have a three-month period to consider and comment if they wish. If issues are raised, then the Commission would look into the proposal in more detail. I hate to say the next bit, but this process can take up to 12 months. During that period the notifying member state cannot proceed with the regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="1003023000064"></a>We are certain that the code will need to be notified and we have built this into the eight-month period allowed to Ofcom. We are also fairly confident that after the three-month standstill we would be able to proceed. However, here's the rub: we cannot be sure that it would not be delayed further. It is only in this type of situation that we envisage that the Secretary of State would allow Ofcom an extension. I want to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that we share exactly his concern.

This was something the Committee wished.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="1003023000068"></a>The ability of the code to establish an independent person or body with the powers and duty to administer and enforce the code was considered at some length during Committee stage. The Government's view was that this was a pragmatic approach, giving the regulator the option to delegate the duties and work of ensuring the code worked properly to an independent body. However, a number of noble Lords took a different view, and regarded the possibility of such an independent body being set up as undesirable and lacking in proper accountability.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="1003023000069"></a>Having listened carefully to what was said, the Government have decided that the benefits of pragmatism are in this case outweighed by the assurance and benefits of ensuring that this code, and the technical obligations code, should one be needed, which are so essential to the effective functioning of these provisions, is administered and enforced by Ofcom as the regulator. This does not affect the requirement for an independent appeals body to be set up. I hope that noble Lords regard this as the right thing to do in the light of the debate we had on this matter. On that basis I beg  to move.</p>

<a name="1003025000001"></a><b><a name="100301-0018.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="1003025000023"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, I rise to move a supergroup of some 19 amendments. These amendments cover the very important area of subscriber appeals, and I am delighted to be able to introduce these proposed changes as a result of the debate that we had in Committee and the many concerns that your Lordships raised about the need for greater clarity and detail in the Bill. The amendments are somewhat complex, and I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if I seek to explain them at perhaps slightly more length than I would want on a single group.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="1003025000002"></a>The changes that we are making in this group do essentially three things. First, we have streamlined the process to ensure that any subscriber appeal should follow a single route to the appeals body and then on to a First-tier Tribunal should technical obligations have been introduced. That means that the dispute resolution mechanism for what is currently called a copyright infringement dispute will be restricted to disputes between copyright owners and ISPs about compliance with the code. We have also renamed these disputes "owner-provider" disputes, which adds clarity and should remove the concerns that many noble Lords expressed about the idea of a "copyright infringement" dispute resolution mechanism.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="1003025000003"></a>Secondly, the amendments provide explicitly that provisions on subscriber appeals should be set out, and complied with, in the code. Finally, and most importantly, the amendments introduce a new clause on subscriber appeals which brings all the provisions on appeals together and introduces a number of new provisions to give more clarity about the rights of subscribers. Specifically, the new clause gives subscribers an explicit right to appeal and requires the establishment of an independent appeals body to be paid for by copyright owners, ISPs and subscribers.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="1003025000004"></a>In response to concerns that your Lordships raised, the new clause provides for the grounds for appeal to include that there was no infringement of copyright, that the report does not relate to the subscriber's IP address and that the copyright owner or ISP contravened a requirement of the code. We listened to what noble Lords said about the burden of proof and this clause makes it clear that in all cases the infringement and the fact that it relates to the subscriber's IP address must be proved and that if that cannot be done to the appeal body's satisfaction then the appeal should succeed. Again, we listened to what noble Lords said about defences and this clause establishes that it will be a sufficient defence for the subscriber to show that they did not carry out the infringement and that they took reasonable steps to prevent other persons from infringing copyright using their internet account.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="1003025000005"></a>In response to a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the clause includes provision for the appeals body to award compensation to a subscriber and to require the subscriber's costs to be paid should an appeal be successful. I believe that this also meets the intention behind Amendment 53 in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Razzall and Lord Clement-Jones. The clause gives the appeals body the power to confirm or reject the application of a technical measure, or to substitute another measure that the ISP

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="1003025000006"></a>The clause includes the provision that was already in the Bill for an appeal against a decision of the appeals body to the first-tier tribunal when technical obligations are in force. Finally, in fulfilment of a commitment that we gave in Committee, it requires that no technical measure should be taken until the appeals process has been exhausted-that is another area of concern.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="1003025000007"></a>I apologise for speaking at some length, but I believe that this is an excellent package of measures, which is very much offered in response to the debates in Committee. I urge your Lordships to support these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

There are many aspects, particularly relating to subscriber appeals, which are very much to be welcomed and which the Minister is now proposing to or has already put on the face of the Bill. I think that we have every reason to thank the Minister for listening in Committee and for improving the Bill and its procedures.</p>

The Minister has clearly received some good tactical advice from his office or the business managers, in that Amendment 51 deals with Clause 8 but the group actually goes up to-we are just entering the second stage, but are not really there until Clause 10-Amendment 100, which relates to the clause after Clause 13. I was not wide awake enough to object to this in terms of the grouping. I would not like to accuse my noble friend of sharp practice, but this is quite clever, as it means that some of the central issues, which I was hoping to debate in relation to Clause 13, are now being dealt with tonight.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="1003025000010"></a>I am happy with a lot of the provisions, even in Amendment 100, which relates to the body dealing with appeals against the process that the notification has gone through. What I am not at all happy with is the whole provision post Clause 13, which allows the appeals body, rather than a court, to impose sanctions. I have a fundamental opposition to this and will have to return to it in some other way-I hope that I can get equally good tactical advice as to how to do it on this Bill. My fundamental opposition to this has perhaps made me sharper in my criticism of earlier parts of the Bill than the Minister thought appropriate.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="1003025000011"></a>At the end of the day, this is where we end up-with an administrative process that denies the subscriber who has been accused of an infringement the right to due process and the right to go to court. In all other cases where breach of copyright is alleged, access to the court on the part of the defendant is always available. This is a new move, which raises fundamental issues. I will not go on about it any further tonight, but I will return to the matter. I need not deal with the  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1312"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column 1312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendments that I have put down in detail tonight-they are intended to be helpful in the earlier part-but when we come to the latter stages and the imposition of the sanctions, I shall remain pretty implacably opposed to this. It will act to the detriment not only of consumers, but also ultimately of the rights-holder industry. We ought to find another way. My latter amendments would delete the reference to the appeals body having the ability to impose those sanctions.</p>

<a name="100301-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="1003025000012"></a>I regret that we are not going to get a sensible debate on this tonight-despite the quality of the personnel still here-but we may have to return to it. It will certainly be a matter of debate in another place.</p>

It is definitely an advance, although I share the fundamental feeling of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that I would rather see this done by due process. Perhaps he should follow the latest advice on how to work out one's frustration with the process of government, which apparently is to stab the upholstery with a felt-tip pen. I do not know how well that would go down here, but there is a lot of good upholstery.</p>

One of the reasons that we have managed not to challenge the Government more on this matter, and that the departments which have introduced the Bill remain rather implacable about it, is that they are not the Ministry of Justice. In an era when the Government claim to be joined up, it is astonishing that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are driving this through against the interests of the citizen and in the interests of industry. It is right that those departments should represent the interests of industry, but where is the representation from the other departments which are meant to be batting in the interests of the citizen?</p>

Should we reward creative rights in industry? I believe that we should and that that is in the interests of citizens overall. Is this flying in the face of justice, natural or otherwise? No, it is not because it is-as the House has agreed-a very gradual process which does not even introduce technical measures until we have had a year to assess the process and we decide that it is necessary to use them at all. If we get to the point where those sanctions are introduced, there is a First-tier Tribunal, which is a judicial process. We believe that is better than dragging people in front of the courts. I again remind noble Lords that nobody gets there unless they really are serial infringers. We have tried to respond to a number of very important and constructive comments that were made during debates on these issues. We have submitted a range of amendments that I believe  have in many cases met genuine concerns, although they may not please everybody.</p>

The regulations will enable us to commence the offences of stirring up hatred on grounds of sexual orientation. The offences themselves are found in the 1986 Act. They were inserted by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. I will not go into the details of the offences here; this is not the right place to have that debate. We want to commence those offences as soon as possible. The regulations also implement the e-commerce directive in respect of the offences of stirring up religious hatred. That also appears in Part 3A of the Public Order Act 1986.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000004"></a>The e-commerce directive plays a significant part in the way that Europe ensures free movement of services within the European economic area. Meeting our obligations under the directive is of importance and helps to ensure a level playing field for service providers.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000005"></a>The directive deals with providers of "information society services"-which are, broadly speaking, commercial activities that take place online. It covers a wide range of online activities, such as selling goods and services, as well as video on demand, hosting a website or providing web or e-mail access. As I said, the directive deals with commercial services provided online and how the providers of such services should  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC318"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be regulated by member states. Such regulation includes the criminal law, if that law affects providers of information society services.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000006"></a>The directive applies to the offences of stirring up hatred on religious grounds and on grounds of sexual orientation. Those offences can cover stirring up hatred through any medium, so it is possible to commit the offences by providing commercial services online.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000007"></a>Turning briefly to the detail of the regulations, I say that Regulations 3 and 4 implement the directive's "country of origin" rules. Those rules broadly say that a provider of information society services must be regulated by the law of the state in which the provider is established, not the law of the state in which the services are received. That is what Regulation 3 does.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000008"></a>Similarly, the "country of origin" principle has the effect that the UK must not restrict the freedom of service providers established in another European economic area state to provide their services in the UK unless certain conditions apply. Such providers will generally be regulated by the other state in which they are based. Therefore, Regulation 4 provides that proceedings for these offences may not be brought against a service provider from another European economic area state, unless specific conditions are satisfied relating to the public interest.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000009"></a>Of course, intentionally stirring up hatred on either ground is a serious offence. In practice, it is therefore likely that the public interest conditions would always be met in such cases.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000010"></a>Regulations 5 and 7 implement the requirements of the directive in relation to intermediary service providers. These are mere conduit providers that cache or host information. The directive requires us to limit the liability of such intermediary service providers.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000011"></a>I will briefly mention some of the history regarding implementation of the directive, which was originally implemented by regulations in 2002. Those regulations applied the directive to all legal requirements then existing, therefore including all offences that existed at that time. For offences passed after that date, we have to implement the directive on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000012"></a>I mentioned that the draft regulations cover the offences of stirring up hatred on the two grounds. The offences of stirring up religious hatred were created by the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, which added a new Part 3A into the Public Order Act 1986. The directive was implemented in respect of the religious hatred offences by regulations in 2007.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000013"></a>The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 extended the offences in Part 3A to include stirring up hatred on grounds of sexual orientation. These regulations are therefore necessary to implement the directive in relation to the extended offences in Part 3A. They will do so in a way which ensures that implementation will be consistent for all the offences in that part.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000014"></a>The regulations are made under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. That Act provides that regulations made under Section 2(2) cannot result in the imposition of a penalty of more than two years' imprisonment. That produces an unfortunate and undesirable anomaly. The offences in Part 3A of the 1986 Act carry a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment. If the two-year penalty limitation were  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC319"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be applied to the regulations, it would mean that offences committed by an England and Wales service provider elsewhere in the EEA would attract a maximum penalty of only two years, whereas the identical offence committed here would attract a seven-year maximum.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000015"></a>To resolve that anomaly, Section 143 of a Bill that noble Lords will well remember, the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, provides that the penalty limit will not apply to regulations made to implement the e-commerce directive. The same issue arises for the EU services directive, and Section 143 applies to both. That section came into force when the 2009 Act was given Royal Assent. The regulations make use of that section and will ensure that the penalties available for offences committed under Part 3A are always the same.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000016"></a>At the same time, to ensure a consistent approach, we are revoking and replacing the previous regulations that covered the religious hatred offence. Those were made in 2007, so the anomaly I have just mentioned applies to them. These regulations will correct that anomaly. There will be a single set of regulations covering all the offences in Part 3A of the Public Order Act 1986.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000017"></a>I began by saying that the regulations would enable us to bring into force the offences of stirring up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation. We intend to do that as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000018"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1003015000077"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the draft statutory instrument, which he described as a technical measure. I have to say that it is a very technical measure, which I had considerable problems trying to understand as I travelled down on the train this morning. I was of the view that this might be legislation by obfuscation, in that I found it difficult to understand what on earth it was getting at. I was grateful for the Explanatory Memorandum, which at least had-as always-something about what was being done and why, under paragraph 7 on the policy background. Even then I was still somewhat confused, and I have only one or two questions to put to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000019"></a>First, I noted the title, but could not work out why race and sex-for example-were not included in the list of things that discrimination might be applied to. They might be covered by other regulations that I have had the privilege of listening to the Minister describe on an earlier occasion.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000020"></a>My next point-again it is very minor, but perhaps the noble Lord will be able to help me-is that the Explanatory Note to the regulations explains, in the last paragraph, that a transposition note has been prepared. I understand that I can get that from the Criminal Law Policy Unit at the Ministry of Justice. No doubt I ought to have got hold of it before this debate. Perhaps the noble Lord can tell me what is in the transposition note, and in the regulatory impact assessment that was prepared by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. No doubt the noble Lord referred to that in his opening speech, but I missed it. I would be grateful for an assurance from him that there is no major regulatory impact, which is why the assessment was made.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000021"></a>I have no further points to make on the regulations.</p>

I decided that this was due to it being above my pay grade, rather than being unclear also to those who were slightly better versed in the measures. It is somewhat clearer to me now, after the Minister gave us such a clear explanation, for which I thank him.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000023"></a>As we understand it, the regulations on information society services are tweaked to fit in with the amended Part 3A of the Public Order Act 1986. They are narrow regulations, constrained in their scope. We hope that they will be applied proportionately. We are in broad agreement with them, but seek one or two clarifications. The first is on the "country of origin" rules. While I understand the way that they will work in England and Wales and in other EEA states, what is not immediately clear is what happens if an offence of stirring up religious hatred or hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation under UK law is committed when the commercial service provider is not based in either the UK or the EEA area-when it is based, for example, in the Middle East or another part of the world. Do we have any mechanisms to deal with that material? This is a wide question, and I will understand if the Minister cannot deal with it today.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000024"></a>My final question is: can the Minister give us an indication of when the regulations will come into effect? He said that he wanted them to come into effect as soon as possible; I wonder whether he has some dates in mind. Will he also clarify whether only England and Wales are covered by the regulations, or whether Scotland and Northern Ireland are also included?</p>

<p><a name="1003015000025"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="1003015000079"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords for their support and contributions. I am delighted that these technical regulations have become marginally clearer as a consequence of my describing them. I will attempt to answer the questions raised.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000026"></a>On the issue of racial and sexual equality, the Acts of Parliament that established offences in that area came before the 2002 directive, and existing regulations cover the position adequately at the moment. There is no major regulatory impact, I am glad to say. The transposition note simply states, in tabular form, how the regulations implement each requirement of the directive. With regard to the other matters, we hope to put this part of the Act into effect in weeks rather than months. That is the best I can do regarding that.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000027"></a>Could a provider based, for example, in the US or the Middle East commit an offence here? A person who commits the offence in England and Wales is liable, so if a service provider commits the offence in the course of providing their services in England and Wales they will be guilty like anyone else. The relevant material to meet the threshold of the offence would need to be threatening and intend to stir up hatred on the grounds of either religion or sexual orientation, but the regulations do not impact on non-EEA providers.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000028"></a>Like anyone else, Scottish service providers that commit the offence in the course of providing their services will be liable for the offence, but the offence extends only to England and Wales so Regulation 3, which extends the liability of service providers to acts

</ul>

<p><a name="1003015000030"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="1003015000081"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My Lords, this order relates to the power of the Information Commissioner to impose a civil monetary penalty on a data controller that seriously contravenes the data protection principles.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000031"></a>The order supplements the provisions of Sections 55A and 55E, which were inserted into the Data Protection Act 1998 by Section 144 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. These amendments provided the Information Commissioner with the power to impose civil monetary penalties.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000032"></a>This order, alongside the Data Protection (Monetary Penalties) (Maximum Penalty and Notices) Regulations 2010, which are subject to negative resolution, will bring the provisions on civil monetary penalties into force. The Government's proposal is for these provisions to commence on 6 April 2010, along with other amendments to the Data Protection Act. The order was debated and approved in the other place last month.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000033"></a>The order contains provisions on data controllers' written representations, cancellation, variation, enforcement and appeals against monetary penalty notices. The other statutory instrument provides details on the maximum penalty amount, which has been set at £500,000, and sets out information that a notice of intent and a monetary penalty notice must contain.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000034"></a>A civil monetary penalty may be served if the commissioner is satisfied that a data controller has committed a serious contravention of the data protection principles that is likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress, and which was either deliberate or committed by a data controller that knew or ought to have known that there was a risk of this type of contravention occurring, but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000035"></a>It is important to note that a number of conditions must be fulfilled before the commissioner can impose a civil monetary penalty. These conditions, which are explained in the guidance issued by the Information  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC322"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Commissioner, will ensure that only those contraventions that are sufficiently serious and deliberate or reckless warrant the issuing of a civil monetary penalty, and will ensure that the penalties are administered fairly.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000036"></a>The Government know how important it is to safeguard personal data. The ICO's Annual Track survey 2009, recently published, shows that protecting people's personal data is considered a top concern, only behind preventing crime. Only a small amount of data need to be misused for damage and distress to be caused.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000037"></a>There is widespread support for the introduction of this power. In particular, your Lordships will remember that the <I>Data Sharing Review</I><I> Report</I>, the Thomas-Walport report, published in July 2008, specifically called for stronger penalties and sanctions and that the Information Commissioner should be given increased powers and resources to carry out his duties more effectively.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000038"></a>More recently, in November and December last year, we held a public consultation on the Government's proposal to set the maximum amount for civil monetary penalties at £500,000. The large majority of respondents agreed that there was a need for such a power and supported its immediate introduction. In addition, there was cross-party support in another place for the introduction of this power.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000039"></a>Additionally, we have worked closely with the Information Commissioner's Office and involved other stakeholders in the development of this policy. We held two stakeholder events to discuss the new regulations and the commissioner's guidance on civil monetary penalties. The Information Commissioner's guidance was also available for comment on the ICO website.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000040"></a>I stress that the majority of data controllers of course comply with the data protection principles, but a small number do not, and it is the irresponsible actions of those organisations that we are trying to address. We believe that civil monetary penalties will act as an effective sanction and deterrent against serious and careless or deliberate non-compliance. We estimate that the likely number of cases in which the Information Commissioner will use this power will be around eight a year.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000041"></a>It is clear that appropriate action must be taken where a data controller deliberately or recklessly contravenes the data protection principles-for example, when a data breach occurred because the data controller processed personal data in a completely unsecure environment, and knew that there was a high risk of a data breach but did not act to address that risk, such as by using unencrypted laptops which contained personal data.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000042"></a>To ensure that the ICO has the resources necessary for this new power and other new responsibilities under the DPA, the Government in October 2009 introduced a new fee structure for notification purposes. It consists of two tiers and will lead to greater funding for the ICO's data protection work. The new fee structure reflects more accurately the costs to the ICO of regulating data controllers.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000043"></a>I will say a few words about how this power will operate. The commissioner will need to be satisfied that there has been a serious contravention of the data  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC323"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>protection principles of the kind liable to a civil monetary penalty. The commissioner will consider each possible contravention on a case-by-case basis. The commissioner laid statutory guidance before Parliament on 12 January this year which sets out his interpretation of the power and how his office will assess the meaning of "substantial", "serious contravention", and "damage and distress".</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000044"></a>A number of safeguards are in place to ensure the fairness of this power. First, once the Information Commissioner is satisfied that a serious contravention has been committed, he must issue a notice of intent setting out the details of the contravention, the proposed penalty, next steps and how the data controller can make representations to the Information Commissioner. Next, a penalty notice would be issued only after representations had been received and considered by the commissioner, or after the deadline for representations to be received had elapsed. In addition, data controllers have the right to appeal to the General Regulatory Chamber against any penalty notice received. On points of law, those appeals can reach the upper tribunal and, further, the Court of Appeal. Finally, the IC's guidance must set out how the power will be used. The Government therefore believe that sufficient safeguards are in place to ensure that the Information Commissioner is not the policeman, prosecutor, judge and jury, as was said in the other place.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000045"></a>As I have tried to explain, this order sets out some of the provisions required to ensure that the monetary penalty framework for serious contraventions of the data protection principles is robust and fair to data controllers and the Information Commissioner. Although the Data Protection Act already gives the Information Commissioner an effective framework with which to regulate the Act, the power to impose monetary penalties of up to £500,000 will provide the commissioner with an important additional tool. It will act as an effective sanction and a deterrent against non-compliance. The commissioner will have no financial incentive to issue monetary penalties because any money recovered as a result of the issue of these penalties will go to the Consolidated Fund, managed by the Treasury. The new powers will contribute to increase compliance with data protection principles and strengthen public confidence that data protection safeguards are observed. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000046"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="1003015000082"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I thank the noble Lord for his explanation of the order, which brings in a new and quite high monetary penalty of £500,000 for people in breach. I thought that it was the order itself that did this but, on going through it, I cannot see where the sum of £500,000 is mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000047"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="1003015000083"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I have the advantage of being briefed on this. The second, negative instrument that I referred to sets out the amount, and the two go together.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000048"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="1003015000084"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I had forgotten that there is a negative instrument as well as the affirmative one before us. As I said, it is quite a high figure and therefore it is only right to ask one or two questions. First, I am grateful to the noble Lord for reminding us that there has been consultation on this. As the Explanatory Memorandum makes clear, some 53 per cent of the respondents  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC324"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>supported the proposal, believing it to be a fair and proportionate approach. Some 32 per cent were against the maximum penalty, but they were not united because that percentage again split more or less half and half, some in favour and some against. Would the noble Lord expand a little on that?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000049"></a>Secondly, I should like to know more about appeals, dealt with in Article 7 of the order. We are told that Section 49 and Schedule 6 have effect in relation to appeals, but I think the noble Lord explained that we go through the whole tribunal process even though there will be only something in the order of around eight cases a year.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000050"></a>Thirdly, I have some concerns about the costs of implementing the civil monetary penalties, which are dealt with in paragraph 10.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum. It states that the costs,</p>
<ul><a name="1003015000066"></a>"will be met by the recent increase in the notification fee from £35 per year to £500 a year for those data controllers with either a turnover of £25.9M and 250 or more members of staff, or, public authorities with 250 or more members of staff".</ul>
<p><a name="1003015000065"></a>I am not clear from that whether those who do not meet the figures will pay just £35 a year, or will they not pay anything? Also, I do not see why we need quite such a large increase. A rise from £35 to £500 a year is quite a big percentage increase. The Minister is better at maths than I am, so he could tell me exactly what it is, or indeed he could look to his noble friend Lord McKenzie. I would guess that it is an increase of several hundred percentage points. I would be grateful to know why it was felt that such a large increase was necessary. No doubt the noble Lord will be given some advice on this before he comes to reply.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000051"></a>That deals with the various questions I have on the order. Again, we on this side do not object to the order, but we would be grateful for responses to our particular points.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000052"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="1003015000085"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> My Lords, we support the order. Indeed, the amendment to the Data Protection Act which made it possible was introduced to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill following amendments from the Liberal Democrats.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100301-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000053"></a>The Liberal Democrats calculate that in 2007 alone a record 37 million items of personal data were lost, including the notorious case where the details of 25 million child benefit claimants were lost in the post. I should declare that I was affected by that. Matters have not improved noticeably since then and there have been additional high-profile cases, including, in 2008, the loss by an external contractor of a memory stick containing sensitive information about thousands of persistent offenders and, in 2009, the case where an employee of T-Mobile sold customers' details to rival companies.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000054"></a>It is right that data controllers should be subject to sanctions when such breaches occur. However, the T-Mobile case raises a question about the operation of the new sanctions which I hope the Minister will be able to clarify. If a deliberate breach is committed by a junior employee and the organisation denies all knowledge of or responsibility for it, how will the Information Commissioner's Office determine whether the data controller took reasonable steps to prevent it and, therefore, whether the organisation is responsible for  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC325"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the breach? I am aware that, to some extent, this is probably dealt with in the draft guidance, but it would be helpful to have an example, if the Minister can think of one, of how these provisions might have applied in the T-Mobile case.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000055"></a>It is also right that the Thomas-Walport review highlighted that the Information Commissioner's Office should be given the powers and the resources to do its job properly. In conjunction with the new powers in the Coroners and Justice Act, we welcome this order's move to give the ICO real teeth in data protection.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000056"></a>I have two questions, the first of which concerns the public response. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, has already raised some issues on this subject but my question is quite simple. We notice that the Ministry of Justice press release states that, of the 52 responses received, 27 agreed that £500,000 was the correct maximum level. Fifty-two responses is a small sample and I wonder for how long the consultation was open. My second question looks forward. While these measures are extremely welcome and we hope that they will go some way towards making data controllers more responsible, will the Government consider improving the regulations earlier on in the system rather than simply imposing penalties?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000057"></a>I refer the Minister to an excellent series of articles in the <I>Economist</I> this week, one of which proposes that regulations could require companies or data controllers to provide annual security audits. These will be similar to financial audits as exist for listed companies, and could be used by companies not only to improve their performance but to assist the regulator by providing evidence should a problem come to light subsequently. So we would like a data information annual audit, please.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000058"></a>That is all I have to say, other than to congratulate the Government on bringing forward the order.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000059"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1003015000086"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful, again, to both noble Lords for their support and helpful questions. On the issue of why there is such a large increase in the tiered fees to the Information Commissioner, tier 2-the £500 tier-represents about 5 per cent of data controllers. For a data controller to be subject to a tier 2 penalty, it must have a turnover of more than £26.9 million and more than 250 staff. We believe that is an appropriate amount. Clearly the Information Commissioner's Office needed some extra resources and we thought that this was a fair way of obtaining them. Everyone will pay at least £35.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000060"></a>I shall deal with the appeal processes. Following the imposition of a monetary penalty, a data controller may appeal the imposition of the penalty and/or the specific amount imposed. Those appeals go then into the tribunal system. Most cases will be heard in the first tier, with the most complex going to the upper tier. Appeals from the first tier to the upper tier can only be on a point of law. Appeals from the upper tier lie on a point of law again to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000061"></a>As for the 32 per cent against the £500,000 maximum penalty, the respondents against the maximum figure were split between wanting a penalty of up to £1 billion and to a sum less than the £500,000. On balance, we felt that the penalty of £500,000 was proportionate. It will be reviewed in three years.</p>

<p><a name="1003015000062"></a>Of course the noble Baroness is absolutely right that the cases take place and the commissioner acts only after discussions have been had with the data controllers. The last resort is to use the law to get penalties so as to persuade against that data protection action. It is not to be used regularly-only about eight times a year, we hope-so she is right to mention the articles in the <I>Economist</I> this week. Any help that can be given to make sure that we do not get into this situation too often is very much to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000063"></a>The consultation period lasted six weeks.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="1003015000064"></a>There remains one outstanding matter: how the Information Commissioner will determine whether reasonable steps have been taken. The noble Baroness referred the Committee to the T-Mobile case and how provision might have applied to it. The Information Commissioner would need to investigate each case on its merits, of course. Each breach would be different and have its own character. Technical data security breaches will require different reasonable steps such as proper electronic data security, whereas a breach relating to an employee failure may require proper levels of staff training. I emphasise that the penalties available if the order is carried come after discussion and debate in an attempt to make sure that data protection really means what it says.</p>

<p><a name="10030121000002"></a>This House provides irrefutable evidence that we are all getting older. By that I mean, of course, that life expectancy is increasing and that more and more people are able to lead full lives and make an active contribution at an age when, not so very long ago, they might have expected to have been put out to pasture. But increasing longevity brings its own challenges; millions of people are not saving enough to generate the retirement income they either want or expect. Nearly half of working-age employees are not making

That is why the Government embarked on the workplace pension reform programme and why we are debating the secondary legislation that makes detailed provision in support of these landmark reforms.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000003"></a>It is some time since this House discussed the provisions now enshrined in the Pensions Act 2008. Over the past 18 months our policy has developed and been refined, in large part because of extensive engagement with stakeholders. We, alongside our delivery partners-PADA and the Pensions Regulator-have made significant progress and our programme of work has evolved as we focused more on the practicalities of implementation. We have already brought forward two sets of regulations that begin the process of making these reforms a reality: the Employers' Duties (Registration and Compliance) Regulations, which cover the compliance regime and the employers' registration obligations to the Pensions Regulator; and the Employers' Duties (Implementation) Regulations, which prescribe the arrangements for the staged implementation of the employer duty and the phasing of contributions. The latter regulations set the timeframe within which these reforms will be put into operation. We propose bringing employers into the duty by size from October 2012, beginning with the largest employers and ending with the smallest, with all employers brought in by September 2016. This is a longer period than originally envisaged.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000004"></a>We went out to consult on an approach whereby employers would be brought in over three years, reflecting the need to deliver the reforms in an operationally achievable and safe way. Following careful consideration, we made a further adjustment to the implementation plan to ensure support for individuals who are new to saving and provide support to the newest and smallest businesses in adjusting to the costs. That means that employers will now be brought in over four years.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000005"></a>Our implementation plan also phases in minimum contribution requirements over time to help employers and individuals gradually adjust to the additional costs. Employers using defined contribution schemes will be required to pay contributions of 1 per cent until staging is complete, 2 per cent for a further year and 3 per cent thereafter.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000006"></a>Increased access to workplace pension saving is crucial to tackling undersaving. By introducing a new duty on employers automatically to enrol their workers into a workplace pension scheme and to pay a minimum contribution towards their pension saving, we are extending access to workers in every employment sector.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000007"></a>The automatic enrolment regulations set out the practical detail that will make the reforms work. They specify what employers must do and prescribe the information flows between the employer, the pension scheme and the worker. We want these regulations to be as simple and flexible as possible and to minimise burdens on employers. That is why we have consulted extensively throughout the past year. Drawing widely on expertise from the pensions industry, employers, business and consumer representatives, and across the political spectrum, we have tested and refined our proposals. We have listened carefully and responded positively to concerns.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC328"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000008"></a>This useful engagement has resulted in a range of changes that will ensure that these regulations will work in practice. Joining arrangements are simpler and should minimise burdens on business, timescales have been extended and information requirements cut back, the refund process has been aligned with payroll cycles, and employers will be able to hold on to contributions until the end of the opt-out period. Stakeholders tell us that these draft regulations now reflect a more straightforward and common-sense approach, which is essential if the new rules are to operate in the real world of pension provision.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000009"></a>The Pensions Act 2008 established who should be automatically enrolled by setting age and earning thresholds. The regulations define pay reference periods. This is the device that will enable employers to identify jobholders with earnings above the threshold which trigger automatic enrolment, and then to calculate pension contributions. We have also provided mechanisms that will help employers manage the process more easily. The regulations enable employers to avoid accidentally enrolling jobholders with annual earnings under the threshold but who occasionally have pay spikes. They provide for the postponement of automatic enrolment, although to protect workers' interests, especially those on short-term contracts of three months or less, employers may only postpone automatically enrolling an individual once in any one year. Automatic enrolment is compulsory. Pension saving is not, so we have prescribed automatic enrolment joining and opt-out periods-now one month-and opt-out rights.</p>
<h5><a name="10030121000061"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000010"></a>Importantly, we have also defined the rules and time limits for refunds, so that any contributions paid by, or on behalf of, a jobholder who opts out, will be refunded. This process has been designed to align with payroll cycles and existing business practices. In particular, it ensures that money does not need to flow into a scheme only to flow back almost immediately. These processes address concerns expressed about cash flows, in particular by small businesses, and ensure that automatic enrolment works in even the most dynamic employment sectors.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000011"></a>An individual's decision to opt out may be the right one at that time but circumstances change. We want these reforms to change behaviours and attitudes towards saving for a pension, and to do this well beyond the initial automatic enrolment stages. For this reason, we require employers to run re-enrolment exercises every three years. Further, the regulations also prescribe what an individual must do, should they decide voluntarily to opt in, either because they are not eligible for automatic enrolment, or because they want to opt in before the employer's re-enrolment date. These arrangements mirror automatic enrolment to ensure a universal process. We have recognised that the employer is best placed to give key pieces of factual information about automatic enrolment to jobholders-for example, the date of enrolment, the details of the scheme, and the value of contributions to be paid to the scheme. The regulations set out the minimum information jobholders will need to reduce burdens on employers.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000012"></a>When the time comes for employers to start automatically enrolling their workers, they will need a  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC329"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scheme into which to do this. Employers may use only schemes which meet the qualifying criteria to comply with the duty. We have therefore defined the characteristics of a qualifying scheme, and set minimum quality standards for money purchase, defined benefit, hybrid and non-UK pension schemes. To make the joining arrangements simple, we have made them the same, whatever type of pension product the employer uses. However, many employers, particularly those with a smaller workforce, find it difficult to provide a workplace pension for their workers at a reasonable cost.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000013"></a>These reforms aim to correct that situation, and that is why the Government are creating the National Employment Saving Trust, previously known as personal accounts. NEST will be a new low-cost pension scheme which will form one of the options available to employers to enable them to meet their new duty. The scheme has been welcomed by the pension industry, which recognises that the existing market cannot meet the needs of all employers and all workers. The NEST order, which is broadly equivalent to a trust deed, establishes the NEST scheme as if it were set up under trust. This order is supported by the scheme rules. We consulted on the draft order and rules last year and responses were positive. There was broad agreement that the order and rules contain the right measures, and we responded to comments by developing the drafts to increase clarity and understanding.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000014"></a>NEST will be a defined contribution occupational pension scheme, and will be broadly subject to the same statutory and regulatory regime as any other scheme of its type. We have, however, included some specific features that recognise the unique role and scale of NEST. We want NEST to focus on those employers and workers not effectively provided for in the existing market. To achieve this, NEST will operate with an annual limit on contributions and a ban on transfers into the scheme. These measures, which will be subject to review in 2017, will ensure that NEST focuses on complementing existing pension provision.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000015"></a>To ensure that every employer and employee has access to an appropriate low-cost scheme, the NEST corporation will have a public service obligation to accept any employer that wishes to use it, and-once an employer is participating in NEST-to accept any worker enrolled by that employer. In addition, it will not be able to set different charge levels for providing the same service to different members. Workers who move jobs frequently can find it hard to keep up their pension savings. However, membership of NEST will be for the individual's working life. Members will still be able to save in the scheme if they move jobs, become self-employed or even move out of the labour market altogether.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000016"></a>Occupational pension schemes are normally required to have member-nominated trustees, and usually have trustees nominated by the sponsoring employer. However, NEST will have millions of members and hundreds of thousands of participating employers, making this approach unwieldy and unworkable. Instead, NEST will have two panels, one to represent members and one to represent employers. The job of the panels will be to ensure that the trustees take account of the views of members and their employers in the operation of  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC330"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the scheme. The members' panel will also allow members to have a say in selecting trustee members who will operate the scheme on their behalf once it is up and running.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000017"></a>All employers will be able to use NEST, and will need information to understand the nature of the scheme in order to decide whether it is right for them and their employees. The NEST corporation will therefore take steps to increase awareness and understanding of the scheme among employers and individuals who wish to use it.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000018"></a>The order gives the Secretary of State the power to set lower or upper limits on charges. This is to ensure that NEST strikes the right balance between the competing policy ambitions of being self-financing over the longer-term and delivering low charges for members. The order also specifies that the NEST corporation must provide information to the Secretary of State. This will enable the Government to assess whether the reform programme is meeting our objectives-for example, by assessing the contribution NEST has made to increasing pension savings among its target membership.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000019"></a>In addition, the order covers areas that you would expect to see in the trust deed of any pension scheme: it provides powers to allow the trustee to make investments on behalf of members, to make rules for the scheme and to charge members for the costs of running the scheme. It also includes provisions relating to the liabilities of the trustee, the payment of benefits to members and pension sharing on divorce. The features set out in the order are fundamental to our policy intentions for NEST. Therefore, the NEST corporation will not be able to change them: the order can be changed only by Parliament.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000020"></a>Setting up NEST is an unprecedented delivery challenge. We estimate that NEST will have between 3 million and 6 million members, and hundreds of thousands of participating employers. To ensure that we get the delivery right, NEST will be launched with a limited number of volunteer employers in spring 2011. This will provide an opportunity to test operations before the automatic enrolment duty comes into force, so that any initial teething problems can be resolved in a controlled environment. To meet this timetable, the NEST corporation will be established on 5 July. This will allow the trustee to finalise the design and operation of the scheme before it comes into being. In particular, only the trustee can decide the investment strategy and set the statement of investment principles. Noble Lords will be aware that we have appointed Lawrence Churchill as chair-designate of the corporation, and are running an exercise to recruit other trustee members. We expect them to be recruited by Easter, enabling them to take up their appointments in July.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000021"></a>With the NEST corporation established and in place, the right course of action is to hand over the remaining implementation and operation of the scheme to the new corporation, and to wind up PADA. The PADA winding-up order makes provision to dissolve PADA on 5 July 2010 and to transfer its property, rights and liabilities to the NEST corporation. This will enable a smooth handover between the two organisations and provide continuity, in order to minimise delivery risks.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000022"></a>Automatic enrolment will create a presumption to save, so that planning for retirement becomes the norm. NEST will ensure that those who do not currently have access to a suitable low-cost pension have the opportunity to save towards a decent income in retirement. These are ambitions, landmark reforms that will help to deal with the demographic change of an ageing society. I am grateful to noble Lords for their forbearance during what has been a lengthy introduction. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10030123000001"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10030123000031"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his thorough presentation of the three statutory instruments, two orders and important set of related regulations, and for his explanation of the background. They are derivative of the Pensions Act 2008, which the Minister steered through this House, and enable the implementation of the provisions of the Act.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000002"></a>Taken as a whole, I agree with him that they are not particularly contentious, although I suspect that were they subject to the forensic skills of my noble friend Lady Noakes, the Minister might find himself under some pressure to be light on his feet. As the Grand Committee will appreciate, there is a degree of consensus on the policy; indeed, my honourable friend Mrs Theresa May has today published a pamphlet entitled <I>Providing for Pensions: Principles and Practice for Success</I>. For my own part, I declare an interest as an employer in a family business and as chairman of the trustees of the Conservative Agents' Superannuation Fund.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000003"></a>We are initially invited to approve the winding up of one acronym, PADA, and the establishment, with its property rights and liability, of NEST. However fond any of us might have become of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority and its personal accounts, we cannot pretend to be greatly exercised by its passing and reincarnation as the National Employment Savings Trust. We should ensure, though, that the new body is constituted to reflect the concerns expressed during the consultation process. Not all the elements raised in the consultation are reflected in the order. Some will depend on the final version of the rules, which will be a matter for the NEST corporation. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that that is the case.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000004"></a>We agree with the National Association of Pension Funds that the new body needs to remain focused on employees without access to a workplace pension. We also think it is important that NEST is as free as possible from political interference. It would be useful to have the Minister's assurance that that is an objective. There has been some modest movement in this direction on the power to remove trustees and on the area covering workers without qualifying earnings. The role of NEST in awareness-raising could distract from its central purpose, which is to extend workplace pension savings to low-income groups that do not currently have access to them. Article 14 appears to tighten up the wording, although it would be useful if the Minister could elaborate on that.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000005"></a>I turn to the original proposal that gives the Secretary of State the power to remove trustees. The National Association of Pension Funds rightly argued that the  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC332"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Secretary of State should be able to use the power only in certain specified circumstances. It is encouraging to see that this power has been removed in the final version of the order.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000006"></a>I turn to the creation of the panels. The original proposal said that employers and members panels should be established within one year of the commencement of the scheme. The NAPF argued that they should be in place from the start. There is no change in the final version, so this remains a cause for concern. It is essential that strong governance is in place from scheme launch. Indeed, I would argue that it is perhaps the most critical time to have the panels up and running. I hope that the Minister can reassure the Committee on this point.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000007"></a>A further question concerns default funds and arises from Article 29(7). I note that the final version of the order gives NEST extra powers to limit the number of occasions on which a member may choose where his or her assets are to be invested and the number of investment funds to which the scheme's assets may be directed. This was not included at all in the original consultation draft. Will the Minister therefore explain the background to its inclusion in the final version?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000008"></a>Article 27 of the order, as the Association of British Insurers has said, provides that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10030123000027"></a>"The Trustee must make deductions from members' pension accounts to contribute to the general"-</p>

<p><a name="10030123000009"></a>a key word that does not appear in the original wording-</p>
<ul><a name="10030123000028"></a>"costs of the setting up, administration and management of the Scheme".</ul>
<p><a name="10030123000026"></a>What is the significance of the introduction of the word "general"-are there non-general costs that will not be so transferred?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100301-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000010"></a>The Minister will be aware of the widespread concern that NEST must not receive government funding that would distort competition. Given that the setup costs for NEST and, for that matter, PADA, are to be reclaimed through scheme charges, how long is the payback period projected to be, and at what point will NEST be self-funding? It would have helped all of us if the Government had published their decision on the charging level and the structure for the personal accounts scheme. Why have they failed to do so to date, and when can we expect it? It is the lack of transparency that disturbs the ABI.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000011"></a>The Minister would acknowledge that spiralling public expenditure on a new national pensions scheme presents a barrier to reinstating responsible fiscal control in the micro-economy. Secondly, a national scheme enjoying taxpayer subsidy and continued funding from the Government for a significant period distorts the market for existing pension provision, and could certainly breach competition law.</p>
<h5><a name="10030123000029"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000012"></a>I make one final comment on NEST. Its stated policy objective is to provide a scheme for the target market of moderate to low income earners. Accordingly, Article 22(1) of the order provides that the maximum contribution that may be made by, or on behalf of, a member of the scheme in tax is £3,600, to be adjusted by the trustee in accordance with changes in the average earnings index. However, Article 22(5) provides  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC333"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC333</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the trustee may determine that paragraph (1) does not apply to a member or a class of member in relation to a particular tax year. It is not clear to us why the trustees' discretion in the regulations is unfettered, although the draft scheme rules for NEST seem to indicate that that is possible only in a limited number of circumstances, notably in the year the member dies. However, there are as yet no final scheme rules. The unlimited discretion for the trustee to override the cap seems incompatible with the policy objective for NEST. Can the Minister clarify in exactly what circumstances the trustee can override the contribution? Why were those circumstances drafted in the NEST rules rather than in the regulations?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000013"></a>I turn to the regulations and the issue of auto-enrolment. Conservatives have long believed in auto-enrolment as a way of encouraging pensions savings. However, that does not mean that auto-enrolment is dependent on the launch of personal accounts or NEST. We have a number of concerns about the existing model, most notably the interaction with means-tested benefits. Moreover, given the lengthy delays in implementing NEST, a Conservative Government would bring forward auto-enrolment for existing company pension schemes.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000014"></a>Although the regulations are widely seen as an improvement on the draft regulations, there are still some areas of concern. For example, timescales may prove to be unfeasibly short in some cases-I instance information flows. I am pleased to note that the CBI is happy with the scheme quality requirements, but the success of the 2012 reforms can in part be judged by the rules which enable high-quality defined contribution schemes to continue to operate. Those have not yet been laid-rightly, because they are too complex-but when they are drafted after the election, they must avoid individualised testing at all costs.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000015"></a>The most important part of the regulations is the change to the 19-day rule, the amendment to the Personal Pension Schemes (Payments by Employers) Regulations 2000, and so on. The refunds procedure is now significantly simpler, but the success of the new process depends on the amendment of the 19-day rule. As the Government noted in their response to the first batch of regulations, the effect of this change is that money will not have to be paid by the employer to the scheme until after the opt-out period has passed, minimising the need for refunds. This will give employers and schemes greater flexibility and enable them to avoid some of the costs and red tape of making refunds, primarily by eliminating third parties from the procedure.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000016"></a>Amending the 19-day rule is a necessary adjunct to the extension of the joining-up and opt-out windows and does not undermine the initial policy intent of the current rule, which was introduced in 1993. For the 2012 reforms to be successful, existing rules should be modified in order to work in tandem with the new regulations. With a strong employer and compliance regime, the changes will not bring in any additional risk for employees in the payment of contributions to their pensions. It is this need to fit in comfortably with existing good-quality provision which presents the greatest challenge.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC334"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000017"></a>As the NAPF points out, more flexibility would protect employers offering good quality schemes from unnecessary costs and reduce the likelihood of employers levelling down. For example, the NAPF has repeatedly called for employers to be allowed more choice around staging dates. These changes are a considerable challenge to, and could place a burden on, employers. Whatever we require should be as straightforward as possible. For example, it is essential that employers can take a common-sense approach to opting out. These regulations set out a prescriptive framework that seeks to limit who can hold forms, when they can be given out and to whom they can be returned. The real world is complicated: things get lost, forgotten, filled in incorrectly and handed to the wrong person. Employers need to feel that they can deal with these situations in sensible ways.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000018"></a>This lies at the core of the anxiety expressed by the other consultees, the EEF and the ABI, who spoke of the need for the Government to continue to listen to stakeholders and not to overcomplicate matters by insisting on onerous calculations and individualised testing. I am reminded of the other activities that I undertake in your Lordships' House, and my view that all Ministers should have a sign above their desks saying, "Remember the Rural Payments Agency and the single farm payment scheme".</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000019"></a>In the most exposed position, of course, is the temporary work industry. It is not fashionable to speak in support of temporary and contract work but it has provided the UK economy with much-needed flexibility, and the job opportunities it offers will be very important in the recovery. It is essential that workers in this market are provided for properly but, as the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation points out, a common staging date would greatly reduce the bureaucracy and cost of their function and remove confusion from workers engaged in this form of employment. In these regulations there is an old-fashioned view of what constitutes a proper job. It is clear that future work patterns will be more flexible. The regulations, which are designed to give proper protection to all, need to reflect this flexibility and the reality of the modern economy.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000020"></a>I conclude with an observation. Few areas of government can produce more complex issues than those which these orders and regulations seek to address. Whatever the vision we may share on the challenge of providing adequate protection for all in their retirement, we would be wise to keep this provision as simple as possible. It needs to be straightforward for employers to administer if it is not to be a bar to employment. Complexity can confuse and confound the best of intentions and this is too important a development to end up bogged down in bureaucracy.</p>

He did at least as good a forensic job as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, would have done in his place and he should not be modest about it. We broadly support these orders.

In 1997, a third of private sector employees enjoyed a defined benefit-that is, final salary-public sector-style pension scheme. Today the figure is 12.3 per cent. That is a dramatic collapse by any standards. The latest figure for private sector employees who have no private pension provision at all is 64.6 per cent. We are starting from a desperate position.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000022"></a>On the detailed points, I do not propose to rehearse, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has, the now broadly sensible and supportive comments of the National Association of Pension Funds, the Association of British Insurers and the Confederation of British Industry. Having worked closely on the Bill and with these important interest groups over the last few years, I am pleased to see that the Association of British Insurers in particular is now taking less of what started as a rather "dog in the manger" attitude towards PADA and NEST. I think everyone is now working in the same way to try to make the scheme a success.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000023"></a>Having said that, the task is enormous and this will be a very modest and slow-moving contribution. We on these Benches are concerned about the slow staging of bringing this in. Does the Minister see and share those concerns? It seems that people believe that their pension is being covered when a total 8 per cent contribution to a DC scheme is very much on the fringe of whether, over a lifetime, it will provide a decent pension. Starting off at the lower levels risks sending the wrong message. If people think that a 1 or 2 per cent contribution will be enough, they are making a very big mistake.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000024"></a>The biggest concern is about the investment policy that NEST will now carry out. I should like to press the Minister on this, although he may not have the full answer today. I would be grateful if he could look into it because it is a serious concern on these Benches. I do not want to name the individual because I do not have any objection to him or even know him, but we are particularly concerned about the background of the investment director who has been appointed and comes from the hedge fund Thames River Capital. He has been quoted as saying that hedge funds must certainly be a part of the NEST investment policy. I was horrified to read that, given the tenor of our discussions on the Bill and the Minister's assurances that there would be a small number of low-cost, simple investment options-probably a bond fund, a mixed fund, a default fund and maybe an ethical fund. I was shocked by the idea that there could be hedge funds or private equity funds with their very high charging structures and costs. I do not know what the recruitment process was, and I wonder if, again, the Minister could look into that and come back. One would have thought that the investment policy and the people running this would come very much from the mainstream of the investment world, such as pension funds or big insurance companies. This causes us serious concerns and I would be grateful if it could be looked into so that we can be reassured about the options on that front. It will be difficult to persuade many people that part of their pension fund should be in even a mainstream equity index product-which, in my view if there is a long-term horizon, it should. I should have declared

I speak with some knowledge of these matters. They are very important, and I was concerned to see those remarks.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10030123000025"></a>The Minister will not be surprised to hear that the other key concern on these Benches is the gaping advice gap. It will not pay for people, particularly those aged over 50, to save a small amount in NEST when there is clearly a high risk that many of them will lose it in means-tested benefits and therefore not be any better off. Again, we are concerned that not enough serious attention is being paid to this worry. Having said all that, within the existing framework that the Government are working to, this is a sensible way forward, but we are very concerned about the individual points that I have raised.</p>

I took from each that they were supportive of the broad thrust of what we are trying to achieve, but they enunciated particular concerns, which I shall try to allay. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, should not feel outgunned by his noble friend Lady Noakes. I am sure that she would have given me a hard time. The noble Lord did equally well.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000049"></a>He also said that he would not be exercised by the passing of PADA because its activities would be inherited by NEST. That is not completely correct, because PADA's role was to advise the Government as well as to prepare for the setting up of the scheme. NEST's role is to run the scheme in the interests of members. That is why the PADA order pushes assets and obligations in two directions, one to NEST and the other to the Secretary of State. The noble Lord asked when the employers and member panels would be up and running. That will happen by the time auto-enrolment starts in October 2012.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000050"></a>The noble Lord said that, should he and his colleagues have the opportunity to implement such reforms, they would look to do so before 2012, with early enrolment into existing schemes to create greatest value-I think that that was the point made by the noble Lord. It is reassuring that others share our view on the critical importance of automatic enrolment; however, it is not possible automatically to enrol workers into personal pensions outside the employer duty, as it would not be consistent with European consumer directives, the distance marketing directive and the unfair commercial practices directive. Our work with our delivery partners confirms that implementation of the employer duty cannot be achieved safely or effectively before 2012. An integral part of the implementation process is the protection offered to individuals through the compliance regime, and we need to make sure that this protection is fully in place for individuals who automatically enrol. That simply will not be possible before 2012. Thereby there are practical difficulties, although the noble Lord would not in any event expect me to concede that he would have the opportunity to test those.</p>

<p><a name="10030121000055"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked who actually determines the rules. It is for the trustees to do that.

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10030121000056"></a>The noble Lord asked specifically whether it was intended that this would be free of political interference. Absolutely, yes-that is the cardinal principle that we are dealing with.</p>

Perhaps I may turn next to the inquiry from the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asking what Article 14 is about. It is important that employers have access to information about NEST so that they can make an active and informed choice about which pension scheme best meets their needs. The Government believe that the NEST corporation will be in the best position to provide information about the scheme. This sort of activity is not normally undertaken by occupational pension schemes, as they usually have close links to a specific employer, and therefore a group of companies. However, this is not the case for NEST as it has not been established by a particular employer for a particular group of employees. Instead, NEST will simply be one of the many pension schemes that employers can choose to use to enable them to fulfil their new duty. As a consequence, there is a clear need to create awareness of NEST and its features so that employers understand how it differs from other pension schemes available to them.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000002"></a>The noble Lord also asked about Article 27 and what the reference to general costs entails. These are the normal costs of a pension scheme, including the  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC338"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cost of collecting contributions, investing those contributions and managing members' accounts. The NEST corporation may cover other costs such as excessive fund switches or non-default investment choice through further charges. The NEST corporation will also have some minor costs associated with its role as an NDPB and in advising Government on pension reforms. These will be met through grant-in-aid rather than through members' charges. We therefore inserted the word "general" to draw an appropriate distinction between the general costs of running a scheme and specific costs where additional charges can be levied, which are set out in Article 27(7) and (8).</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000003"></a>The noble Lord went on to ask about the contribution cap: whether in any circumstances the trustee has wide powers to disapply the contribution cap and if this would go against the policy intent. It does not give the trustee a mandate to disapply the contribution limit as it sees fit. The circumstances in which the trustee can exercise discretion are set out in the rules, and if the trustee wished to change the circumstances, it would need to consult. The trustee needs a degree of operational flexibility so that it does not become unnecessarily restrictive to administer the limit, and the rules set out the precise circumstances in which the trustee may exercise this power; namely, where a member dies or the trustee's liability in respect of a member is discharged in a tax year.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000004"></a>The noble Lord asked about funding. My department continues to work closely with the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority to develop a funding strategy to establish the NEST scheme. However, it remains too early publicly to set out the cost of NEST or the detail of how it will be financed. We have always said that we can make final decisions only once procurement activity is complete-that is, when the "i"s are dotted and the "t"s are crossed-and we must avoid the risk that, by responding to understandable interest in the cost and financing of the scheme, we jeopardise PADA's commercial negotiations. It is vital that we do all that we can to support PADA in securing the best deal for NEST's members. We expect to be making announcements in this area shortly.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000005"></a>The noble Lord also referred to state aid. This was part of our debate during the passage of the Pensions Act. We have always been clear that we will not give NEST an unfair advantage compared to other schemes. The structure of NEST as set out in the legislation is explicitly designed to ensure that it complements the good quality provision that already exists. We need to ensure that all employers and employees have access to a low-cost scheme, even those that other providers do not want. That is why the regulations place a public service obligation on NEST to accept all employers and to charge all members on the same basis. Other providers would not do that.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000006"></a>Remember that automatic enrolment cannot operate unless all employers can access a suitable pension scheme, so NEST's public service obligation will benefit both those currently excluded from pensions saving and the broader pensions industry, because it is necessary to enable auto-enrolment to be introduced, with consequent benefits due to a subsequent expansion in the market. However, this public service obligation, as  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC339"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>well as the other limitations being placed on the scheme's operation, could place unique funding pressures on NEST, and this is something that we will better understand once PADA's procurement process is more advanced. It seems only right, however, that at this stage we do not rule out compensating the scheme in some way for the burdens being placed on it if the alternative is to undermine its low-cost aims. That concept is recognised in the European state-aid rules, whose purpose is to prevent anticompetitive behaviour.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000007"></a>The noble Lord referred to employment agencies and their significance in the current flexible labour market in the UK. Our estimates represent the aggregate costs of the reforms to business, and they factor in enrolment activity and job churn, and take employment agencies and temporary agency workers into account. The administrative costs are calculated separately by firm size, but cannot be separated into those businesses with high and those with low job churn.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000008"></a>The noble Lord referred to the length of the initial period in respect of the appointments of the NEST corporation. Prior to the corporation being established and during any initial period, all appointments to the corporation are made by the Secretary of State. At the end of the initial period, the corporation must have at least nine members in place. As I said, we have already recruited Lawrence Churchill as the NEST chair-designate, and we are currently focusing on a second recruitment exercise to appoint a deputy chair and about seven other members.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, referred to someone being appointed to deal with investment matters. I think that that was an appointment to PADA, not to the trustee corporation, but I will come to that point in a moment.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked about certification and avoiding individualised testing. We are committed to developing a user-friendly certification model for workplace money-purchase schemes. We understand that this is a particular concern for employers with existing pension schemes who calculate contributions based on basic pay. We decided to remove certification from the draft workplace pension reform regulations to allow us more time to work with stakeholders to develop a model that meets the needs of employers and ensures that individuals are protected. We have returned to first principles and are talking to employers, the pensions industry and consumer groups about what will work for them. My officials are already engaged in early discussions with stakeholders, including the ABI, the CBI and the NAPF to discuss possible options. The engagement to date has been very constructive.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000011"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, talked about restrictions on the times when members can change investment funds. As I say, this is simply a matter of good administration. It avoids the circumstances where a member makes unreasonable demands by changing funds with undue frequency. The trustee must be reasonable in setting the detail of this provision. We consulted on it, and for the sake of clarity it was included in the draft scheme rules to the order.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said that the staging was too slow and could have an adverse impact on individuals and their savings. The challenge of implementing these reforms is unprecedented, because they affect more than 1 million employers and more than 10 million people. We are committed to providing the right balance between getting people into pensions saving as quickly as possible, and delivering the reforms safely and fairly. We have done a lot of work with our delivery partners to understand how they will implement the reforms, and we have concluded that staging over four years strikes the right balance to ensure that the effective systems will be in place to support employers in their new duties.</p>

I am sorry if I did not make it clear what my reservation was. I appreciate that there is an enormous logistical problem with the system, and do not disagree with the timing. However, it is quite wrong and even dangerous to have a scheme come in whenever it can on the basis of much less than a final 8 per cent. That is a snare and a delusion. The systems are the same whether the contribution rate is 1 per cent or 3 per cent. I am sorry if I did not make it clear that my worry is about that and not about timing.</p>

It was always envisaged in the Act that there would be a phasing-in that would interrelate with the staging arrangements. That is partly to help individuals who have not saved in pensions schemes before to adjust to the costs and consequences of doing so; and similarly to help employers who have not previously engaged. On the issue of staging, we recognise that some people will have less time than others to build up savings. We estimate that somebody who enrolled last could have a pension fund 3 per cent lower than if they had enrolled first-but that is because of the staging rather than the phasing-in component.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000015"></a>The noble Lord asked about investment risk. These reforms are intended to enable individuals to make greater financial provision for their retirement by making contributions to a defined-contribution pension scheme that meets defined quality standards. Like any DC scheme-as the noble Lord is well aware, being an expert in these matters-NEST will aim to earn a return on contributions by making appropriate investments. Inevitably, this involves making a judgment on the balance between the anticipated return from investment and exposure to risk. PADA is carrying out the initial work on the investment approach for NEST. It will prepare recommendations for the NEST corporation which will, as the trustee of NEST, make all investment decisions. PADA has consulted extensively with the pension investments industry, unions, employer representatives, consumer groups and academics in order to develop recommendations that best meet the needs of NEST's likely membership of low to moderate earners. That consultation was widely praised for its analysis and thorough coverage.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000016"></a>PADA's emerging thinking, following consultation, suggests that the investment approach that many UK DC schemes take, whereby members' contributions

Certainly one would not imagine the involvement of hedge funds. PADA is likely to recommend to the NEST corporation a strategy that invests members' contributions in a range of asset classes such as government bonds, stocks and shares, cash and alternatives. Such an approach would be designed to reduce volatility, as sharp falls or rises in the fund value would create the risk that some individuals would get back less than their contributions. In any DC scheme there are no guarantees of what an individual's final pension will be. A variety of factors can influence pension income, such as future annuity rates, inflation and interest rates, as well as returns on investment. I hope that that has given the noble Lord a flavour of where the exercise is heading.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000017"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10030126000127"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> Is that the end of the Minister's answer? I raised a serious question about the appointment of Mark Fawcett, but the Minister does not seem to be aware that he was appointed. He appeared to say that that is for PADA and that he would deal with it later, but he has not dealt with it-so could he please answer the question? As I understand it, Fawcett will continue to be employed by NEST and lead the consultation and advisory processes for it. Can I have a substantive answer to the question? Why was someone appointed from that background in investment? What was the process? Why were mainstream people from pension funds and insurance companies not appointed? I am pleased to hear his assurance that it would not be investing in lots of hedge funds, but would hedge funds or private equity be appropriate at all for NEST? I cannot see how they would be.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000018"></a>I heard the word "alternatives" at the end of what the Minister was talking about. In the investment world, "alternatives" is shorthand for hedge funds, private equity and possibly currency speculation-I do not know. Can we face up to this issue? Will the Minister take this back and look at it seriously? I am horrified, and I believe that all the people who were involved in the discussions that we had on the Pensions Bill will be horrified, that even one penny of the pensions and savings of low-paid people, who are most at risk on a no-charging scheme, will be put into dangerous investments of this kind.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000019"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10030126000128"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, this was a public appointment and the noble Lord might be most helped if I write to him setting out the background of the process.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000020"></a>On the issue of assurances about the investment profile of NEST, this is a matter for the trust corporation and its members. It is not for the Government or PADA to dictate how it should proceed, although it is given and will give advice. I hope the noble Lord will have gleaned from what I have just said that it looks as though the thrust of that advice will be towards lower-risk operations. I do not want to say too much because it is not for the Government to determine these matters; it is for the trust corporation to do that.</p>

I am sure that the noble Lord will draw to the attention of PADA and NEST the detailed debates we have had about the investment policy and what the principle should be; I remember them well. I hope they are now drawn, fully and properly, to the attention of the people taking these decisions so that they are aware of what Parliament's intention was. If they look at those debates and the noble Lord revisits them, they will see that there is no way that investment in hedge funds or private equity is appropriate.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000022"></a>I recall that we had a discussion on the PPF with Lawrence Churchill, who initially did not seem to take much notice of what Parliament had said. I am pleased to say that he then very quickly took notice and behaved in a more proper way. I hope that the Minister will focus on this, take the matter away and draw it to the attention of these people, who do not seem to be aware of what was said in Parliament. I am sure that if he looks at what he said and what we said in Committee on the Pensions Bill, he will see why I am concerned.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000023"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10030126000130"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I am happy to take the matter away but the noble Lord should not deduce from anything I have said that the way forward is likely to be other than on the basis we discussed in Parliament. The debate on social and responsible investment did a couple of rounds through the various courses of the Bill and that matter will also be before the trust corporation and its members.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000024"></a>We are setting up the trust corporation as an independent body to run the pension scheme in the best interests of its members. The people appointed to the board of the trust corporation should be experts and have knowledge in these fields. The direction of travel of investment policy that the noble Lord infers is probably wide of the mark. However, I will take the matter away. I am sure that those involved will take the opportunity to read what has been said in these debates and the debates in the other place around this issue so that the noble Lord's position, and the position we discussed as the Bill was going through Parliament, are clearly understood.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, also raised the issue of information and advice for individuals. Again, that was a significant issue that, reasonably, preoccupied us for much of our time when we were discussing the Bill in Parliament. We are developing an information service as part of the Planning and Saving for Later Life campaign. People will be able to access the information they need via the "better future" pages on direct.gov or via a dedicated telephone helpline.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000026"></a>We have already launched phase one of the service covering state pensions. We are working closely with other expert organisations and carrying out research to develop the content on auto-enrolment. We will be providing information so that people can identify what options they have. Some individuals may wish to seek further information-for example, those considering paying off large, high-interest debt first. That is the case for any financial decision. We are working with other expert organisations, including TPAS and the FSA, to ensure that people with more complex financial circumstances are provided with the information that they need.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000027"></a>I remind the noble Lord that the analysis done at the time, which I think is the most up-to-date analysis that we have, could not identify any one group of people who would likely to be worse off from saving in personal accounts-or NEST, as it now is. Sorry, that covered auto-enrolment, not just NEST. The analysis showed that 70 per cent were likely to get back twice what they put in and 95 per cent would get back at least what they put in. That was the analysis done at the time, and I believe that it still holds good.</p>

The independent PPI identified that women aged over 50 were definitely a high-risk group. That remains our most serious concern. I am sure that the Minister will accept that they are at higher risk of it not paying to save than other groups</p>

<p><a name="10030126000029"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="10030126000132"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Again, I am speaking from memory, but I believe that that question was considered in the analysis at the time. It did not conclude that we could assume that women aged over 50 were in large measure likely to lose out from the arrangements. I know that we had that debate at the time. Clearly, no one can be certain of an individual's passage through life and what may beset or become of them and therefore, from day one, what their pension profile will mean, but the analysis that we did in aggregate could not identify a particular group of people who would be missing out.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000030"></a>I hope that I have dealt with all the questions raised. If I have not, I would be happy to have another go, but I think that that has covered everything that was raised. If there are no further points, I commend the orders.</p>

This was signed on 16 June 2008. This treaty has not yet entered into force, but will do so once all 27 countries have ratified it. This order is a necessary step towards the UK's ratification. The principal effect of the draft order is to ensure that the powers under Section 2 of the European Community Act  1972 would be available to give effect to any provisions of the agreement, and permit any expenditure arising from the SAA to be from the consolidated fund.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000032"></a>Like many other countries in the region, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a troubled past and experienced terrible suffering during the conflict of the 1990s. Since then, Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress. However, much more remains to be done to embed long-term stability and prosperity. We believe that the draw of EU integration will continue to be a crucial factor in motivating and enabling BiH political leaders to agree and implement the necessary reforms. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is support from all three constituent peoples and the main political parties for the objective of EU membership. Our task today is to debate how this reform process can move forward.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000033"></a>I should underline that the UK remains a strong supporter of the principle of EU enlargement, including the countries of the western Balkans. Enlargement has been one of the European Union's biggest success stories, creating stability, security and prosperity across our continent. The prospect of EU membership was an important factor in supporting the peaceful transition to democracy in Greece, Spain, Portugal and central and eastern Europe. It is a vital tool in helping us to spread our values and freedoms across the continent. A larger EU gives us stronger influence in shaping global action to meet today's challenges and helps business and our economy by providing access to a bigger market. Nevertheless, it is important that enlargement is based on conditionality-that a country may only join the EU once it has met all the criteria for membership and has undertaken the necessary

The implementation of the stabilisation and association agreement is an important step in the fulfilment of that conditionality.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000034"></a>The SAA recognises Bosnia and Herzegovina as a potential candidate for the EU. It is not a reward; instead, it is an instrument to enable BiH to move forward. It sets out stages for Bosnia and Herzegovina's progress towards eventual EU membership via a closer partnership with the EU, under the EU's stabilisation and association process. A track record of SAA implementation is required before Bosnia and Herzegovina can achieve candidate status. Bosnia and Herzegovina's SAA has now been ratified by 18 EU member states, as well as by the Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliament and the European Parliament<I>.</I> The order is important and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000035"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="10030126000137"></a>Baroness Rawlings:</b> My Lords, as we have heard, the purpose of the order is formally to give parliamentary approval to an EU stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The order that ratifies the SSA will provide enhanced co-operation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU. The agreement was signed on 16 June 2008. It covers a wide range of agreements, including accession to the WTO, promoting further regional co-operation and fostering fair trade between Bosnia and Herzegovina and its neighbours, some of which are already undertaking similar processes. There are additional measures on co-operation to combat terrorism; on border and visa controls; on assistance to support democratic, economic and institutional reform; and generally to help the country to conform to EU standards. This country has declared its interest in joining the European Union and is now recognised by the EU as a potential candidate for membership.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000036"></a>We on these Benches agree that the SAA offers a powerful incentive for change. We hope that it will build towards peace and stability in the area. Bosnia has made remarkable progress since the end of the war. However, although it is no longer on the verge of armed conflict, it remains deeply divided, especially politically. There is still serious conflict over the nature of the state and the role of the international community. Bosnia has a significant way to go to provide better governance and services to its citizens. The SAA is not the most controversial treaty on European matters. I doubt that the order will face much, if any, strong opposition. However, if the order is passed, it will represent an agreement to which the United Kingdom will be party. Bearing this in mind, I have a few probing questions for the Minister.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000037"></a>Last month, Republika Srpska passed legislation to enable it to hold a referendum on secession. It has also attacked the work of impartial international judges and prosecutors in Bosnia. Undoubtedly, one factor that would most help the political stabilisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be the full co-operation of its neighbours, both Serbia and Croatia. What more could Her Majesty's Government do to demonstrate to Republika Srpska that secession will not be tolerated by the international community? What are Her Majesty's Government doing to improve the authority of the international judges and of the Office of the High Representative? Does the Minister support the view  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC346"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that, although Bosnia and Herzegovina still has much work to do, it should be supported in its desire to join NATO? If so, what are HMG doing to encourage EU members to work with them on their NATO membership conditions?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000038"></a>Given Bosnia's background, the positive measures contained in this SAA will unfortunately be in danger of being held hostage in a fragile political environment. These difficulties could increase in the run-up to the elections planned for October this year. Will the Minister say what plans are in place to make certain that the elections in October operate fairly and peacefully? Will he assure us that there are no plans to remove EUFOR at least until the next Bosnian elections in October 2010?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000039"></a>The agreement aims to encourage free trade between the EU and Bosnia, and between Bosnia and its neighbours. Will the Minister tell the Committee what progress has been made in facilitating this, in the context of moving towards an overall free-trade area? Finally, will the Minister tell us why the SAA is being ratified only now, when the agreement was signed in 2008? What implications will this agreement have for visa and immigration arrangements?</p>

<p><a name="10030126000040"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="10030126000138"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for presenting these orders to the Grand Committee for approval. I also thank the opposition spokesman for her remarks and questions. I will support the questions that she asked, and look forward to positive answers from the Minister.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000041"></a>We considered a stabilisation and association agreement for Montenegro on 2 December. There are similarities here: we are dealing with the same geographical area. Anxieties were expressed, not least by my noble friend Lord Ashdown, about the breakaway tendencies that were referred to by the opposition spokesman today, and about the disturbing signs in the area and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are anxious that there should be no encouragement from neighbouring states for these tendencies, which would make it more difficult for Bosnia and Herzegovina not only to make internal geopolitical progress but also to keep to the conditions of the agreement. This is welcome and, as the Minister implied, is a stage towards possible future membership of the EU, although not a guarantee. However, there is an implication that that is the will. It was handled very well by the Slovenian presidency when this agreement and treaty were first promulgated, and indeed at the same time as Slovenia impressed us all by joining the euro-a long time before the United Kingdom, which remains a pity for many of us as observers.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000042"></a>Having said that, there is now tremendous good will not only in the neighbouring states, apart from the rather disturbing examples I referred to while deliberately not mentioning too many names, but also in the western side of the European Union for what may be a beneficial effect on the stability of the whole area and indeed on Bosnia and Herzegovina itself. This has been a complicated agreement that was not easy to reach. As we know, the UK is a strong supporter of EU enlargement, including to the countries of the western Balkans, and that is why we on these Benches welcome the order.</p>

They have raised a number of questions that are of concern to us all in a candid and apposite way. It is important not to see the SAA as the completion of the journey or even the completion of the beginning of the journey, but as the beginning. I am therefore grateful for the support expressed that we should continue to offer encouragement to Bosnia and Herzegovina while at the same time setting out the conditionalities to be met. If it aspires to EU membership, it must meet the values that most countries would eagerly sign up to as a matter of pride.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000044"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the referendum in Republika Srpska. We are deeply concerned about the ongoing ethnic and nationalist rhetoric in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in particular the challenges made to the authority of the high representative as set out in the Dayton peace accord. It is important to state that we continue fully and strongly to support the high representative in his efforts to improve the functionality of the state and uphold the Dayton agreement. It is a view shared by our European partners and is a message that should be taken closely to heart by those in the country concerned.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000045"></a>As I say, we want to encourage the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we are doing that by preparing them for integration. We urge on the one hand for the politicians in that country to find common ground and to make the compromises necessary to ensure further progress on the reform agenda, and on the other by supporting the high representative and EU special representative in facilitating progress. We believe that by sticking to the principles of a firm application of conditionality, the draw of EU integration can be used to drive reform forward in the country. We are prepared to fund and support a number of projects aimed at helping the country prepare itself for further EU integration, particularly by building capacity in key institutions and supporting civil society engagement in the political process.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000046"></a>I was asked about the question of NATO membership. In December, NATO Foreign Ministers decided not to invite Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the membership action plan. We strongly support the country's ambitions for NATO membership and we recognise that progress-impressive progress in some areas-has been made in defence reform, and emphasise regularly that the door remains open on individual partnership programme status and ultimately to membership. Again, though, it is important to remember the need for conditionality. We therefore support NATO's decision because we believe that the credibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina's application would be strengthened considerably by making progress in addressing concerns about levels of legal and political functionality and by resolution of the outstanding issues of allocation and the disposal of defence property. These are not minor issues by any means, given the degree of concern that they cause in that country.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000047"></a>Another question was whether Bosnia's neighbours are acting constructively. We believe that they are. I am certain that we have seen constructive action over recent months. The authorities in Serbia, Croatia and  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC348"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Montenegro all continue to underline their commitment to helping Bosnia and Herzegovina move forward. They are all signatories to the Dayton peace accord; as such, they are required to uphold the territorial integrity and constitutional structures of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and they have all reiterated that commitment. Good neighbourly relations are a key requirement for Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia themselves to make progress towards EU accession.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000048"></a>The final point was about why this taken quite so long. Not least, there are the difficulties that we have in putting these things before Parliament; the question of scheduling for parliamentary progress in these matters has played not a small part in the delay-but we are here where we are. We have an important decision to make. I hope that I have been able to answer the noble Baroness's and the noble Lord's questions.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000049"></a>This is about the UK fulfilling its role as a member of the EU, and the EU's role as a source of stability. We believe that these are vital to the future peace of the western Balkans. The SAAs for the region are important building blocks in this regard. Ratification of this agreement will serve as a strong political message that the EU firmly supports the perspectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider region.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000051"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10030126000141"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Baroness Thornton):</b> My Lords, there are three statutory instruments before noble Lords today. The first set of regulations deals with various matters relating to Part 2A orders, which a justice of the peace may make to protect human health. The second set of regulations relates to local authorities' powers, while the draft order makes a minor consequential amendment to the Water Industry Act 1991.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000052"></a>I will set out brief details about the regulations. The Health Protection (Part 2A Orders) Regulations require the local authority, if it makes an application to a justice of the peace for an order, to notify certain people. This includes, as might be expected, the person who is the subject of the application, unless the local authority takes a reasonable view that the person is likely to abscond or to act in a way that would undermine the purpose of the application.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC349"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000053"></a>Next, the regulations specify the evidence that a JP must have available before he or she can make an order about a person. These are quite detailed evidential requirements and will be of considerable help to the JP in determining whether the criteria for an order, which are set out in the primary legislation, are indeed met.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000054"></a>Furthermore, the regulations provide a number of safeguards for people who might be affected by an order. They ensure that all orders relating to people are restricted to a maximum of 28 days. They set out who is an "affected person" with the right to appeal against an order, including the deceased's next of kin in the event that an order is made in connection with a dead body. They require the local authority to help people subject to an order to understand what the order does, why it has been made and their right to appeal against it; and to tell the person of any support services that are relevant to their circumstances.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000055"></a>If a person's liberty is restricted by an order-if they are detained or subject to quarantine-the local authority must have regard to the impact of the order on the person's welfare and that of any dependants they might have.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000056"></a>The regulations also provide a discretionary power for a local authority to make a charge for any measures it undertakes as a result of an order. This could happen if an order requires someone to take certain measures but the person cannot or will not do so, whereby the local authority has to take action itself. Finally, the regulations require all applications for orders and all variations and revocations of orders to be reported to the Health Protection Agency.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000057"></a>I turn now to the draft Health Protection (Local Authority Powers) Regulations. These regulations set out what local authorities can do to respond to public health threats, without needing to apply to a JP for an order. The powers are not very different to the powers local authorities have now. However, they are considerably updated and brought into line with the principle of the new legislation that, with some limited exceptions, powers imposing restrictions or requirements on a person should be subject to judicial oversight.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000058"></a>The regulations continue existing arrangements under which a local authority may keep away from school a child who could put others at risk from infection or contamination, subject to strict criteria being met. In the event that other children have been exposed, the authority can require a list of pupils at the school for contact-tracing purposes. A local authority may also prevent access to or contact with a dead body which presents a risk to health.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000059"></a>The regulations allow a local authority to make a formal request to someone to take certain action, or to desist from action, as the case may be, for health protection purposes; and to disinfect or decontaminate any thing-Members of the Committee will remember the discussion that we had about "thing"-or any premises on request. The local authority may, but is not required to, offer compensation. These powers will usually be adequate to deal with a health protection issue quickly and with minimum fuss. But if not, the authority may consider applying to a JP for an order.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC350"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000060"></a>The draft Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Consequential Amendments) Order is also before the Committee today. This makes a straightforward consequential amendment which is needed as a result of the repeal of Section 11 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. I do not need to detain the Committee any longer on this matter. However, that amendment to the 1984 Act reminds us that the regulations are part of an important programme to modernise the legislative powers available to those who deal with risks to public health from contamination or infection.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000061"></a>The Committee will be aware that the Health and Social Care Act 2008 made substantial changes to the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. Those changes introduced powers to deal with significant threats to human health from dangerous infections or contamination from chemicals or radiation. Out-of-date concepts have been removed and new arrangements for health protection are in place to meet the needs of modern society. However, we cannot bring these new measures into force without first making regulations to complement the changes made to the Act. These regulations will complete the picture of domestic health protection powers and allow us to bring all the new measures into force from this April.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000062"></a>Some noble Lords may recall that I spoke in Grand Committee in May 2008 about these changes to health protection law, then being introduced in the Health and Social Care Bill. In the course of those debates, my noble friend Lord Darzi of Denham and I made a number of commitments to Members of that Committee as to matters to be included in regulations under the proposed new powers. I am happy to say that we have met all of those commitments in these regulations on the Part 2A orders. I have briefly set out the provisions of the regulations and I hope that the Committee will see how we have met, and indeed exceeded, those commitments.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000063"></a>I will mention one issue which was raised last year in the course of our consultation on the regulations. Most respondents broadly supported them as they were then drafted, but a number raised concerns that the legislation could have an adverse impact on people with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. We debated this very point in 2008 and I am sorry that it is still a concern for some stakeholders. We have tried to set minds at rest, because the legislation simply does not permit the use of compulsory powers other than in very narrowly defined circumstances, and certainly not just because a person has a particular type of infection. My honourable friend the Minister for Public Health recently met my noble friend Lady Gould of Potternewton about this matter.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000064"></a>My honourable friend endeavoured to reassure the noble Baroness, and I repeat the assurance, that there are strong, effective safeguards in place to protect people against the misuse of powers. I am pleased to say that, at the Minister's invitation, stakeholders in the field have been contributing to the preparation of guidance on the new legislation. That work is nearing completion, and I hope that the guidance that will shortly emerge will reassure those who still have concerns. In addition, I assure the Committee that we undertake  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC351"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC351</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to publish information from the reports of applications for orders, as required by regulations. That will ensure that their use is monitored.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000065"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that we cannot be complacent about the threats to our health and society from unforeseen sources. Infectious disease is estimated to cause about a fifth of all deaths across the world. In a global society, with swift and frequent travel, international trade and movement of populations, there is potential for new strains of infection to emerge and spread. We also face increasing risks from contamination in various forms, whether accidental or deliberate.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000066"></a>Of course, most people suffering from infection or contamination would not dream of putting others at risk. Health protection legislation is needed for the very rare circumstances where someone refuses to take action to protect others and there is no other way to deal with the potential harm but through compulsory measures, proportionate to the risk presented. Any measure which includes powers to place restrictions on people, or requires them to do certain things, is rightly scrutinised rigorously for its implications for human rights. We believe that the amended Act and the regulations we are debating today achieve the right balance between the protection of human health and respect for individual rights. They provide an effective way to deal with threats, but at the same time contain safeguards. I commend the regulations and the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000067"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10030126000142"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, the Committee will be grateful to the Minister for introducing the regulations which, as she said, take us back to our debates on what is now the Health and Social Care Act 2008. Looking back on those debates, I think that we can be quite proud of the role that this House played in encouraging the Government to make sensible and desirable changes to the manner in which the provisions of the Act are brought into effect. Most of those changes are designed in one way or another to safeguard the rights of the individual in the face of the range of restrictions and requirements which the authorities can deploy for the purpose of public health protection. I remain grateful to the Government for being so receptive to the proposals that a number of us made in that regard.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000068"></a>I turn first to the Part 2A orders regulations, and to Regulation 4, which covers the evidence required for a justice of the peace to be sufficiently satisfied as to make an order under the provisions of the Act in relation to a person. First, under paragraph (2), he must receive a report giving details of the person concerned. The report need not be in writing and, as I understand it, has to include only one of the four elements listed in paragraph (2)(a). There is nothing wrong with that, it seems to me, as long as the combination of evidence presented is sufficient to purport to show that a particular person represents a significant risk to public health. In that context, my query relates to the third element,</p>
<ul><a name="10030126000103"></a>"the outcome of clinical or laboratory tests".</ul>
<p><a name="10030126000099"></a>That is a rather non-specific phrase. I would have expected it to say "the outcome of clinical or laboratory tests in relation to P". The point of the evidence listed  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC352"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in paragraph 2(a) is surely to show that a person, P, presents a significant risk. It is surely not sufficient to cite evidence of a general nature about the outcome of laboratory tests. I should be glad of the Minister's comments on that.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000069"></a>Paragraph (2)(b) of Regulation 4 relates to the nature and characteristics of the infection or contamination in question; for example, the mechanism by which it spreads and how easily it spreads between humans. The problem with that, it seems to me, arises with new infections such as swine flu, whose characteristics and mode of spreading may be completely unknown when it first manifests itself. Swine flu is a particularly good example, because not only were its characteristics unknown when it first appeared, but it was thought to have a greater degree of lethality than later proved to be the case. How is a local authority supposed to present evidence to a JP about an infection if the relevant facts about that infection are not yet available? Does this mean that in circumstances of this sort local authorities will simply have to rely on their power to request people's co-operation, and that they will not be able to apply for a court order unless and until the relevant facts about the infection are established?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000070"></a>Regulation 7 provides for discretionary powers to enable local authorities to make a charge in relation to Part 2A orders as they apply to things and premises. I believe I am right in saying that this issue never came up in our debates on the Bill, and I was therefore a little surprised to see it. The power to make a charge is, I gather, not contained in the 2008 Act but rather in other local government legislation. In principle, this is not an unreasonable provision. However, paragraph (3) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10030126000102"></a>"The amount of the charge imposed ... must not exceed the actual costs (including staff costs) incurred by the local authority in taking measures in relation to the thing or premises pursuant to the order".</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000071"></a>Any student of accountancy will know that there is no such thing as the actual costs. To take an example of a different kind, if I have lunch in a restaurant, the cost of my lunch could be reckoned as just the cost of the raw food; or the food plus the wages of the chef and the waitress who serves me; or those things plus a share of the restaurant's light, heat and power bill; or those things plus a share of all the overheads of the business including the overheads of its head office. Any of these, taken as the basis of a calculation of costs, could be presented as being reasonable, but each gives a very different result. A person on the receiving end of an invoice from the local authority might regard a figure nearer to the marginal cost as being more reasonable than one based on full-cost accounting principles. What guidance will be given to local authorities in this regard, and on what basis will local authorities be encouraged not to levy a charge where the person would find difficulty paying?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000072"></a>The regulations set a time limit of 28 days on all orders made in respect of a person. However, they do not do this in relation to orders made in respect of things or premises. Why is this? What are the remedies open to someone whose property has been seized and quarantined indefinitely?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000073"></a>One aspect of these regulations which has caused considerable concern is their potential use in relation  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC353"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC353</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to those infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections-an issue which the Minister raised. She will remember very well that we debated this issue during the passage of the Act in 2008. The particular concern in this area stems from the very nature of sexual health services, the effectiveness of which depends on people having absolute trust that any information about them will be kept completely confidential. If individuals who may be infected with HIV are afraid that the law may require them to disclose details about themselves and their sexual partners, it is highly likely that this will deter them from presenting for testing and treatment in the first instance. That would be against their own interests, as well as those of others with whom they may be in contact.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000074"></a>Against that background, can the Minister give an assurance that the Government will monitor the use of these powers to ensure that they are not being deployed unjustifiably in relation to people with HIV and other STIs? The Government have always been clear that the powers would be used only in the most exceptional circumstances and I accept that that is their intention. Nevertheless, the all-hazards approach adopted in the regulations makes it possible that local authorities may pursue an overzealous agenda. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that the Government will keep a watch on these issues. The annual reports from the Health Protection Agency will provide them with the means to verify that the powers are being used in accordance with the published guidance. In addition, I hope that the Government will be alert to any unforeseen or harmful effects of the powers on sexual health services and on the communities most affected.</p>
<h5><a name="10030126000110"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000075"></a>I turn to the local authority powers regulations and first ask the Minister what I hope is not a difficult question relating to Regulation 8. This confers a power on the local authority to request that any person or group of persons should co-operate with it for health protection purposes. I am curious to know why we need this regulation, because surely the local authority can already make any requests that it likes of people in pursuance of its statutory functions.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000076"></a>Secondly, Regulation 3 contains a power for the local authority to require a head teacher to provide it with a list of names, addresses and contact telephone numbers for all the pupils of a school when certain conditions have been satisfied. I am concerned about this: not in principle, but because of the apparent absence of safeguards over who may get hold of this information-some of which, in the wrong hands, could lead to all manner of problems. The Minister will doubtless tell me that the provisions of the Data Protection Act will apply, but will she reassure me that safeguards will be in place to ensure that untoward leakage of information to unauthorised persons does not occur and that there will be guidance to that end?</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000077"></a>Finally, I turn to the phraseology used in Regulations 4, 5, 6 and 7 in connection with the charges that local authorities are empowered to levy for disinfection or decontamination of things or premises. The regulations state that the local authority's charge must not exceed  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC354"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC354</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the cost incurred by the local authority in carrying out the disinfection or decontamination. Again I ask the Minister, what the meaning is of the phrase, "the cost incurred"?</p>

<p><a name="10030126000078"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10030126000143"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, for the thorough way in which she introduced the regulations. I have been looking forward to discussing them because, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, they stem from a piece of primary legislation that was subject not just to detailed but to expert scrutiny in your Lordships' House. I note in passing that my main disappointment is that the word "fomite" does not appear anywhere in the regulations. That was one of the many issues on which the noble Lord, Lord Walton, educated those of us who took part in the discussion.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000079"></a>I will reiterate part of the discussion that your Lordships had on the primary legislation. It is correct that we should update public health legislation, some of which has been in existence since the 19th century. It is right that we should take into account the exceptional nature of some of the new public health dangers that have emerged in the past 10 years. However, it is incumbent on us to remember that they are exceptional dangers. It is worth reminding ourselves before we go any further that the existing public health law is used largely in cases where people with mental health problems are a danger primarily to themselves rather than to others. While in future some public health risks may be of a magnitude much greater than that, at the moment it is envisaged that the legislation will apply principally to the group of people to whom it applies now. That is why the general thrust of criticism in your Lordships' House of the primary legislation was that there was insufficient protection for people who are vulnerable, and who may be ill. The Government have addressed some of these concerns in the regulations, but there are some areas of emphasis where they have got it wrong. Therefore I, too, wish to start by considering the Health Protection (Part 2A Orders) Regulations.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000080"></a>Like the noble Earl, the thrust of my concern starts with regulation 4 in regard to clinical or laboratory tests. As far as I can see, there is nothing in the regulations which states that the tests have to have been conducted upon a person; that that person should know the outcome of the tests; and that that person should subsequently have behaved in a way which indicates that they are wilfully ignoring the outcome of those tests. That is a problem. Many thousands of people in this country have been tested for HIV but do not know the outcome of the test. They are not routinely told because the tests are conducted as part of a battery of tests for other things. Can the Minister clarify that that is the process which a person who is making an assessment of the level of danger posed by someone has to go through? In particular, the evidence that someone has wilfully ignored the level of threat that they may pose to other people is a crucial issue.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000081"></a>Regulation 4(5) states that the evidence upon which the justice of the peace will base a decision,</p>
<ul><a name="10030126000104"></a>"may be given orally or in writing".</ul>
<p><a name="10030126000100"></a>Am I correct in assuming that evidence would be given orally only in a matter of extreme urgency and that it would routinely be the case that evidence was submitted  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC355"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in writing and then recorded? The Minister may feel that I am being slightly pedantic, but when you increase the likelihood of depriving someone of their liberty you have to increase the level of protection for that person.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000082"></a>I, too, want to focus on the issue of charges. The marginal and direct costs of decontaminating premises will vary dramatically depending on what is involved. This can vary from sending in a squad to clean out a house that has been left uncleaned for many years-which is the circumstance under which many orders have been issued in the past-through to chemical decontamination. Is there a right of appeal for someone who has such charges levied on them? If not, why not? Some people lead unstable and chaotic lives that lead them into situations where they come under the auspices of this law, and they do not have much money.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000083"></a>Another issue that I wish to raise concerns the next-of-kin lists. Quite rightly, donees give a lasting power of attorney, but do the next-of kin lists include people who have been given a power of attorney under the old system, which pre-dated the current system, and who might therefore not be registered on the new list? Many of the people we are talking about are likely to become old and frail and they may have a power of attorney under the old system which has not been registered under the new system.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000084"></a>On the Health Protection (Local Authority Powers) Regulations, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, made a fair point about people to whom lists of schoolchildren could be given. I, too, want clarity on that. The question which underpins both orders is the training of local authority staff who have to make judgments in both cases. We have a set of regulations that are designed to meet all circumstances. That means that the people who have the power and responsibility to invoke these regulations need to know that they have available a variety of responses that are proportionate to different levels of risk. In her introduction, the noble Baroness talked about people who pose a threat to others. The majority of people who will fall under these regulations pose a threat not to others but to themselves. Therefore, the level of judgment which a local authority officer has to take in that case is somewhat different.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000085"></a>I echo what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said about monitoring and reporting on the imposition of these regulations nationally. I very much look forward to the Minister's response to my questions.</p>

<p><a name="10030126000086"></a><b><a name="100301-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10030126000144"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Before we started, when I was talking to the officials, I think I spotted pretty much the sort of areas with which the noble Earl and the noble Baroness would be concerned, with one exception. The noble Earl did not ask about the safeguards for children, but I have a response on that. I shall work my way through various questions.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000087"></a>The noble Earl asked about testing and evidence, as did the noble Baroness. Regulation 4(2)(a) makes it clear that the details in the evidence must be,</p>
<ul><a name="10030126000105"></a>"insofar as known and relevant".</ul>
<p><a name="10030126000101"></a>"Relevant" is the important point there. The point about the clinical and laboratory tests is that tests may be carried out on things and premises, as well as on a

I am trying to imagine what that may mean, but it is probably correct; you may be testing P's environment as well. That is why that regulation does not mention P.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000088"></a>Why does the legislation extend to those who may be infected or contaminated? The issue here is that some diseases-for example, tuberculosis and mumps-are infectious before symptoms appear. New diseases with these characteristics may arise in the future. The noble Earl indeed said that the unknown may be a greater threat because it is unknown. Where there is a good reason to suppose that a person may have been infected and may be infectious to others, it may be necessary to take appropriate measures straight away, either through a medical examination or quarantine. A community could be placed at serious risk if no action were possible until after the infection had been confirmed by conclusive diagnosis or the onset of symptoms.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000089"></a>The noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raised the issue of the reporting of orders. We discussed this during the course of the Bill and outside. I had several meetings on how one monitors this and why it is important to do so. Part 2A orders require local authorities to report all applications for an order, and all variations and revocations, to the Health Protection Agency.</p>
<h5><a name="10030126000111"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000090"></a>The Department of Health and the Health Protection Agency have agreed that that information will be published in a way that does not allow the identification of individuals, although the precise mechanisms have yet to be agreed-that covers the point about confidentiality. However, there will be a central record of the orders, and centrally collected information will be included in the HPA's annual report. Although the data will be anonymised, they could still contain sensitive information that would enable an individual's identification, so we have undertaken that the information from the reports will be published in a way that does not identify individuals or details of cases that are not appropriate material for an annual report.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000091"></a>Both noble Lords raised the issue of HIV. We are very keen that the safeguards in place will ensure that the powers are not misused. We hope that they will reassure people that they need not fear the new legislation. We have endeavoured to meet those concerns in guidance, and stakeholders are participating, as I said in my opening remarks. Those discussions are progressing very well. The HPA will be alert to any detrimental effect on sexual health services, and we have undertaken to publish the reports on orders, because we are concerned that that does not affect people coming forward for necessary tests.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000092"></a>On the proper use of information and how we safeguard it, the regulations provide that a local authority can require children's contact details from the head teacher only where strict criteria are met-in short, if it is necessary to have them for the purpose of taking action to protect human health. We will be looking for reassurance that local authorities, which are used to handling and safeguarding confidential data, should do so. There is no reason to suppose that the position  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC357"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC357</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be any different because the local authority will be requiring the information, but we will also make that clear in guidance.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000093"></a>The noble Baroness asked about legal powers, the spectrum of measures available to protect public health and how we will ensure that the most vulnerable and confused people are protected, to help them as well to ensure that they are not a threat. She is right to say that often they are a threat to themselves rather than to the rest of the world. We have to strike a hard balance here, because we want to ensure that surveillance, immunisation, advice and treatment can be deployed to deal with public health threats. We have anecdotal evidence that very few orders made or considered in relation to people with drug-resistant infectious TB have helped to contain the risk of the infection. That is to say, we are mindful of the need to ensure that the procedure is used proportionately.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000094"></a>Both noble Lords raised the issue of the reasonableness of requesting payments. We think that it is important that local authorities have the power to request payment. That is a general, flexible power to ask people or groups of people to take or refrain from action to protect human health. The accompanying power to pay compensation or costs for expenses incurred as a result of complying would remove a possible disincentive to co-operation. A JP order is the last-resort measure for exceptional circumstances where voluntary co-operation is not forthcoming. The request power will allow local authorities to make a formal request for compliance before resorting to a JP order.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000095"></a>We think that the guidance will cover the issue of costs and the scale of the charges. These must be reasonable-that is a requirement of the regulations. Local authorities are very experienced at calculating full-cost recovery and how that needs to be charged. However, it is a discretionary power, so if it would be a pointless exercise, they should not go through with it. It would be absurd to try to retrieve costs when the person concerned has no resources at all, but it is very important that those powers exist.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000096"></a>It would be disproportionate and unnecessary to provide a specific route of appeal for circumstances that would happen very rarely. The Act already provides in Section 45M that a person who has been ordered to take a particular action, or who is an affected person in relation to such an order, may apply to the JP for the order to be varied or revoked. Under regulations, a charge that the local authority makes must be reasonable  


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC358"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column GC358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under the circumstances and must not exceed the cost. It provides a safeguard for the person subject to the charge, who ultimately has recourse to judicial review.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000097"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, the guidance that we are developing will set out the process that a local authority must go through, including a risk assessment, before deciding to exercise its power or apply for a JP order. The noble Baroness also raised the issue, which was discussed when the Act was going through, of a representative. Somebody appointed under the Mental Capacity Act is required to act on behalf of certain persons. That is something that we would need to take account of.</p>

<a name="100301-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10030126000098"></a>I think that covers most of the questions that have been raised by noble Lords. It was another useful gallop around this issue.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="1003012000115"></a>EU: Trade Ministers' Informal Meeting</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="1003012000003"></a><b><a name="100301-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1003012000103"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I represented the United Kingdom at the Spanish presidency's Trade Ministers' informal dinner on 21 February. I welcomed the presidency's constructive highlighting of the importance of external trade for the economic strength of member states, and the importance of open and fair markets globally as the world emerges from the current economic crisis. I pointed to the importance of trade and exports to help tackle unemployment, currently at 10 per cent across the EU-27 member states. The EU needed an open, fair trading system for our global competitiveness. I was pleased that my comments were reflected well in the new Commissioner, Karel de Gucht's response, and I look forward to the UK working closely with the new Commission to deliver this critically important agenda.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1003012000004"></a>I emphasised the importance of reaching a balanced conclusion to the Doha development round. Only through the multilateral trade structures can we address the unfair and unbalanced array of trade barriers which prevent growth, particularly in developing countries. But I also said that the United Kingdom welcomed EU progress on reaching free trade agreements, which were a stepping stone to a multilateral agreement. I welcomed the initialling of the agreement with Korea-with potential value of €19 billion for the EU-and stressed the importance to the UK and EU of free trade agreements with India and Singapore. On a free trade agreement with Andean countries currently under negotiation I was clear that we would need reassurances of adequate and appropriate human rights provisions.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1003012000005"></a>I warmly welcomed a renewed focus on economic co-operation with our major trading partners, and the contribution this could make to EU competitiveness. We needed to prioritise relations with the US, Japan and China. We should focus on regulatory co-operation, on international standards, and an intellectual property framework that reflected emerging new technologies and supported greener economic growth.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1003012000006"></a>I pointed to the importance of addressing trade barriers at the EU's external borders. DG trade in the Commission needed to work with other directorates-general, in particular tax and customs, health and consumers, and energy and transport, on a risk-based approach to trade regulation and improve or remove disproportionately bureaucratic measures.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1003012000007"></a>I strongly argued that we had to modernise our trade defence rules and ensure a transparent, economic and business-focused system that recognised the realities of global supply chains.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="1003012000008"></a>International trade and investment have the potential to bring benefits not only to our own economies, but also to developing countries. I therefore applauded the overall EU member state provision of more than 40 per cent of the global aid for trade. But I argued that the Commission needed more effective and more flexible systems for spending it. On economic partnership

We also needed mechanisms to implement and monitor existing EPAs. I pressed the Commission to make progress on the review of the general system of preferences (GSP). We needed increased transparency around the effective implementation of GSP+. I drew all member states' attention to the plight of Pakistan. I argued that there was an overwhelming moral and political case to support the Pakistan economy at this time, and that an adjustment of rules within GSP+ could bring trade benefits that would have wider, mutually beneficial social and political impact. Finally I emphasised the importance of decent work. I argued that working more closely with the ILO we could make important progress to ensure that standards were raised and secured without creating artificial barriers to trade.</p>

On 25 October 2007, my right honourable friend, the Prime Minister, announced an independent review of the 30-year rule. The review, chaired by Paul Dacre, published its findings in January 2009. The Government have carefully considered those findings.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1003012000015"></a>As my right honourable friend, the Prime Minister, announced on 10 June 2009 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 10 June 2009 col. 797) the Government plan to reduce the rule to 20 years via amendments to the Public Records Act 1958 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Government believe that a 20-year rule offers the best balance between openness, affordability and the protection of the public interest in good government.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1003012000016"></a>The new information access arrangements set out in the Government's response to the 30-year rule review will provide earlier access to a wide range of public documents, while also ensuring that we are able to protect the most sensitive information and the constitutional relationships that underpin our system of government.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="1003012000020"></a>I am today announcing the Government's intent to publish <I>Rewarding an</I><I>d F</I><I>ulfilling </I><I>L</I><I>ives: The </I><I>S</I><I>trategy for </I><I>A</I><I>dults with </I><I>A</I><I>utism in England (2010)</I> on 3 March.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="1003012000021"></a>The Autism Act 2009 was a unique and groundbreaking piece of legislation which signalled this Government's commitment to improve the lives of people with autism and their families-and it has been reinforced by a range of action across government to boost the profile of autism across public services.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="1003012000022"></a>The Autism Act committed the Government to publishing a strategy for adults with autism in England no later than 1 April 2010. We are indebted to the honourable Member for Chesham and Amersham (Cheryl Gillan) and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Autism for its work in bringing forward this legislation.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="1003012000023"></a>Autism is a lifelong developmental disability and although some people can live relatively independently, others will require a lifetime of specialist care.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="1003012000024"></a>There are approximately 400,000 adults with autistic spectrum conditions (ASC) in England, around half of whom have a learning disability.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="1003012000025"></a>Service-engendered barriers to education, employment and the wider community bring economic disadvantage, social isolation, and mental and physical ill health for adults with ASC. Therefore addressing social exclusion for adults with autism is an issue which demands a collective response from services across the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="1003012000026"></a>The autism strategy will set out very clearly what we want for people with autism, and indeed what they should expect from public services and their communities. This new national strategy is an ambitious statement of intent focusing on five core elements:</p>
increasing awareness and understanding of autism;developing a clear, consistent pathway for diagnosis in every area, which is followed by the offer of a personalised needs assessment;improving access for adults with autism to the services and support they need to live independently within the community;
<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="1003012000027"></a>helping adults with autism into work, and</p>
enabling local partners to plan and develop appropriate services for adults with autism to meet identified needs and priorities.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="1003012000028"></a>Each of these areas has its own chapter in the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="1003012000030"></a>Last year's National Audit Office report (5 June 2009) <I>Supporting People with Autism through Adulthood</I> reveals widespread evidence of services not meeting need and made a case that investment in services, particularly to support people with high-functioning autism (including Asperger's syndrome) into employment would deliver substantial savings to the public purse.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="1003012000031"></a>The strategy is a practical document. It starts with a long-term vision, but its core is in laying the foundations for long-term change. The overall approach is shaped by existing policy, in particular:</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="1003012000032"></a>tackling social exclusion;</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="1003012000033"></a>personalisation of public services as articulated in <I>Putting People First</I>; and</p>
the emphasis on local solutions to meet local needs; and above all the emphasis on fair chances and opportunities for all.
<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="1003012000034"></a>These form the backdrop to the strategy and give much of its underlying direction. More specifically the strategy recognises the breadth of existing policy and programmes that should deliver better for adults with autism. The strategy focuses on how to make these existing policies work better for adults with autism.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="1003012000035"></a>The strategy is reinforced by a range of actions across government:</p>
we are funding a study giving better data on the prevalence of autism in the adult population;we will publish before end March a first year delivery plan to set out in more detail the timescale for implementation in 2010-11;we will launch in early summer consultation on statutory guidance for health and social care bodies to support delivery, and publish that guidance before the end of the year;there will be a new national programme board to oversee delivery;we will develop delivery plans for years two and three of the strategy to maintain momentum; andwe will review the strategy in 2013.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="1003012000036"></a>I am confident that the strategy marks a key milestone on the journey towards full inclusion and equality for people with autism. But real success will depend ultimately not only on transforming services, but on changing attitudes across our society. This is not going to happen overnight. We need to work together to achieve our common goal of full inclusion and equality for people with autism.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="1003012000038"></a>The Armed Forces served with distinction in Iraq in successive Telic operations. A number of allegations of abuse of Iraqi citizens by British service personnel have been brought to our attention by public interest lawyers and more are anticipated. Many of them are sketchy and incomplete in their details; all relate to events that occurred a long time ago; we are no longer in Iraq in significant numbers; we do not have access to the claimants; and the seriousness of the behaviour alleged varies considerably. Investigating these allegations thus presents a huge challenge. Over 120,000 British service personnel have served in Iraq and the vast, vast majority have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour, displaying integrity and selfless commitment. The uncertainty created by these allegations risks unfairly undermining their reputation and achievements and we owe it to them, and to the claimants, that these allegations are properly investigated.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="1003012000039"></a>We are therefore determined to ensure that such investigations are carried out thoroughly and expeditiously, so that-one way or another-the truth behind them is established. We firmly believe that open consideration of the issues will establish once and for all that the vast, vast bulk of British forces behaved professionally and responsibly in Iraq in the most challenging of circumstances.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="1003012000040"></a>The Special Investigation Branch (SIB) of the Royal Military Police (RMP) has made progress in investigating the claims. To date we have been treating these allegations on a case-by-case basis, but as more have been brought to our attention we have decided to devote even more resource to this work. We are therefore looking to set up a dedicated team-the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT)-to concentrate on these allegations, so that these can be addressed as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="1003012000041"></a>Some argue that the Government should hold a public inquiry into these allegations: we disagree. We do not believe that a public inquiry would uncover criminal behaviour, but in the unlikely event that it did, a public inquiry would unable to investigate it fully, even less impose punishments: that would be wrong. Instead we want the court to be assured that, so far as possible, the facts will be investigated-and that this will be done transparently, fully and in a reasonable timescale. The additional resource which the IHAT represents will help to bring matters to as swift a conclusion as is possible. And with this assistance the independent service justice system, including the

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="1003012000042"></a>Setting up this new team is not an admission of fault. Nothing could be further from the truth. Rather it is a demonstration of the continuing commitment of the MoD and the Armed Forces to transparency and our respect for proper investigation. The time has come to deal with these unproven allegations once and for all. We have nothing to fear and everything to gain by this approach, because the truth is important for the vast majority of British troops who behaved to the highest standards in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="1003012000044"></a>I am pleased to announce the joint publication by the UK Border Agency and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of <I>International Challenges, Interna</I><I>tional Solutions: Managing the M</I><I>ovement of </I><I>P</I><I>eople and </I><I>G</I><I>oods</I>.

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="1003012000045"></a>Today's publication updates on progress since our 2007 international strategy and sets out how the UK Border Agency and the FCO will strengthen existing partnerships and develop new ones to continue to deliver our objectives overseas. It also shows how the Government plan to do more to help developing countries to maximise the development benefits of migration and to mitigate the negative effects where they occur.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="1003012000046"></a>We have made impressive progress towards the goals we set out in 2007. Our overseas border controls have been strengthened through the increased use of risk and intelligence tools. The introduction of the points-based system has delivered a transparent system which allows us to adapt entry criteria based on economic or labour market conditions in the UK. We have also worked closely with international partners to improve co-operation on the return of migrants who are not entitled to be in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="1003012000047"></a>While our priority is to pursue the interests of the UK, the impacts of migration on other countries cannot be ignored. We are determined to keep improving our migration policies so that we do more to facilitate overseas development. We are considering policies that aim to contribute towards this goal.</p>

<a name="1003012000049"></a><b><a name="100301-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="1003012000109"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Baroness Thornton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Mike O'Brien) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="1003012000050"></a>On 20 July 2009, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Ann Keen) announced the outcome of the joint Department of Health and UK Border Agency review of the rules on overseas visitors' access to the National Health Service in England, and the Government's intention to consult publicly on the change proposals. Today, on her behalf, I am fulfilling that commitment by launching the consultation.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="1003012000051"></a>The proposals in the consultation strike a balance between public health needs, managing migration and upholding humanitarian principles, ensuring that we continue to deliver high-quality care to all those with a legal right to it while protecting our NHS from those who would take advantage of it.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="1003012000052"></a>The consultation includes proposals to increase the time that UK residents can regularly stay outside the UK before losing automatic entitlement to free NHS hospital care, and to protect unaccompanied children who arrive in the UK. We propose to exempt from charges failed asylum seekers who are co-operating with, and are supported by, the UK Border Agency prior to returning to their own country, but to charge all other failed asylum seekers.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="1003012000053"></a>In my honourable friend's earlier Statement (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 97WS) she said that the Government were attracted to the principle that some visitors should be required to pay for their NHS treatment through personal health insurance, as is already the case in some other countries. Although developing a scheme that is fair and effective will be challenging, we are determined to take this forward. We will now seek views on the merits and feasibility of key principles and mechanisms for making this work, which have the potential to both increase the income that the NHS receives from overseas visitors, and to act as a deterrent to those seeking to abuse the NHS.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="1003012000054"></a>We have also taken the opportunity to consolidate the current regulations that underpin the policy on the charging of visitors, and to improve the supporting guidance that we provide for the NHS. Neither of these updates reflects any change in entitlements or operating practices, but they are provided in draft form for people to examine and comment on prior to them being launched.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="1003012000055"></a>The Minister of State for Borders and Immigration is today also launching a consultation on the proposal to refuse entry to the UK to those who have significant outstanding debts for NHS treatment. This will help the NHS to recover debts and discourage further those visitors who travel to the UK to seek treatment without paying.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="1003012000056"></a>The period for responding to the consultation will run until 30 June 2010. I have placed the consultation document in the Library and copies are available to honourable members from the Vote office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="1003012000062"></a>Target time for the registration of applications is 90 per cent in nine weeks. This takes into account the increased numbers of LPAs OPG expects to receive and develops the aim from 2009-10 of 80 per cent in eight weeks of receipt. Ninety per cent in nine weeks is more challenging and provides a better service for a larger number of customers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="1003012000065"></a>The timescale to notify new deputies within 20 working days remains the same as last year. However, we have increased the target percentage from 90 per cent to 95 per cent. This will improve service to more of our customers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="1003012000067"></a>A full case review of all deputyship cases subject to supervision will be carried out at least every three years, and this year the target is to review a minimum of 40 per cent of cases. A case review could be a combination of, review of annual report; carrying out a visit; review of supervision level following short-term intervention.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="1003012000068"></a>Last year the target was to review 10,000 cases that require intermediate and light-touch supervision will be subject to a case review during 2009-10. The reviews in the coming year will be more specific to the individual issues within the case, and we see this as a key element to helping deputies understand and appreciate the PG supervisory function.</p>

To ensure that a decision is taken at the beginning of the next Parliament on the basis of the fullest evaluation, the Secretary of State has today asked Sir Andrew Foster, former controller of the Audit Commission, to provide an independent assessment of the value for money of the programme and the credibility and the value for money of any alternatives which meet the programme's objectives. It is critical for rail passengers that the right long-term decision is made about the next generation of intercity trains, which will have a life of 30 years or more.</p>

If Sir Andrew Foster reaffirms that the Intercity express programme is better than the alternatives, the Secretary of State's intention would be to proceed with the project in the next Parliament, subject to satisfactory resolution of all the contractual issues.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_11"></a>
<a name="1003012000095"></a><b><a name="100301-wms0002.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="1003012000114"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="1003012000096"></a>The building of the Thames tunnel is vital for the future health of Londoners and for the environment and reputation of our capital city. I would like to inform the House that I am minded to direct applications for the tunnel to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) under Section 35 of the Planning Act 2008 because I believe that this is likely to be the most appropriate and effective way of reaching a decision on this unique and complex project.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="1003012000097"></a>Around 32 million cubic metres of untreated sewage and rainwater pollute the River Thames tideway every year from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) when stormwater capacity is exceeded. A CSO is a feature of a combined system, introduced for the purpose of relieving the system of flows in excess of a selected rate, the excess flow being discharged to a local receiving water. A combined system is a system that takes in both rainwater and sewage. The discharges occur, on average, once a week and have a significant environmental impact on the river. These discharges can increase the likelihood of fish kills, create a higher health hazard for users of the river and damage the aesthetic appeal of the Thames. Following the Thames tideway strategic study the Government identified the tunnel, which will intercept around 30 million cubic metres of the average annual discharge, as the best solution to protect the River Thames and to ensure that the capital has a sewerage system able to cope with the impact of population growth, more intense rainfall patterns and the reduction of green space available to soak up rainfall.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="1003012000098"></a>I believe the project to be of national significance and I am minded to direct it to the IPC for the following reasons:</p>
it is essential to meet the ecological water quality objectives of a major river; 


<notus-date day="1" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS164"></a><b>1 Mar 2010 : Column WS164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it is essential to reduce the risk to human health and prevent negative aesthetic impacts;the unsatisfactory intermittent discharges cause reputational risk to the UK, detracting from the appeal of the river in the nation's capital, which is otherwise a great asset to residents and visitors alike;the unique scale and complexity of development will lead to an equally large and complex planning process and the Government have a clear interest in ensuring that the planning process goes as smoothly as possible, to ensure that there are not significant delays in addressing the problems caused by these sewage overflows, while ensuring the process is transparent and that all interested points of view are given a proper opportunity to be heard; andthese improvement works are needed to enable us to continue to meet our obligations under the urban waste water treatment directive. The urgency of the works is increased by the infraction proceedings being pursued against the UK by the European Commission for an alleged breach of the directive.
<a name="100301-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="1003012000099"></a>I believe that a Section 35 direction is likely to offer the most efficient route for a decision on development of the Thames Tunnel. The announcement that I am minded to direct the project to the IPC will allow Defra to work with the directly affected London boroughs, Thames Water and other London stakeholders to discuss what a Section 35 direction is likely to involve. It will also allow us to include consideration of the Thames tunnel in the national policy statement for waste water.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="1003012000100"></a>The ongoing input of local planning authorities and local stakeholders will be vital. Under the Planning Act, scheme promoters have a duty to consult, and local authorities can make representations if they think promoters have not adequately consulted with local authorities on how they carry out their consultation with local communities. This can result in an application not being accepted as valid by the IPC. Local authorities will also be invited to submit local impact reports as part of the IPC's consideration of applications.</p>

<a name="100301-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="1003012000101"></a>A final decision on whether to direct the project to the IPC will not be made until after planning applications are submitted under the Town and Country Planning Act. I do not expect Thames Water to submit these applications before the autumn of 2011.</p>

It is essential that they have the authority and capability to deal with individuals who pose a serious threat to UK and other International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) troops, the Afghan security forces as well as the local population.</p>

<a name="100301w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="10030111000004"></a>ISAF, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation-led security and development mission in Afghanistan, is not responsible for charging or prosecuting detainees. ISAF forces are mandated to either transfer detainees to the Afghan Government for prosecution through their judicial system or release them. As a sovereign nation, responsibility for prosecution lies with the Government of Afghanistan. The question of how many prisoners detained without charge or prospects of trial by the Governments of Afghanistan and the US is a matter for those governments to answer.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="10030111000005"></a>The London conference held on 28 January welcomed the Government of Afghanistan's determination to take on increasing responsibility for detentions. The UK will continue to work with the Afghan authorities to build capacity within their detention and judicial systems. The Government of Afghanistan will decide what review procedures should be put in place.</p>

In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, its remit will be set by the Department for Transport and I expect one of the areas for consideration to be the possibility of extending the jurisdiction of the British Transport Police.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_27"></a><a name="10030111000036"></a>Those carrying out the review will want to take account of the views expressed on the subject during the passage of the Policing and Crime Bill and the undertakings given by the Government at the time. The arguments for extending the British Transport Police's remit are well known and I would expect those with a direct interest to be given the opportunity to comment further before any significant changes were made.</p>

For example, colleges achieved a qualification success rate of 81 per cent in 2007-08, against the target of 80 per cent that was set for 2011. Our apprenticeship programme also saw a record successful achievement rate of 71 per cent in 2008-09-up from 37 per cent in 2004-05. The second inspection cycle of 2005-09 by the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) shows that 65 per cent of colleges were judged to be good or better. This is significantly better than the first cycle (2001-05) where less than 50 per cent of colleges were judged to be good or better.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_182"></a><a name="10030111000199"></a>We are also seeing increasing professionalism in the FE teaching workforce. Through a series of reforms, including requirements for teachers to hold appropriate qualifications; work towards qualified teacher learning and skills status; and be professionally registered with the Institute for Learning (IfL), we are ensuring that both pedagogical and subject specialist skills are maintained and enhanced. All teaching staff must undertake a minimum of 30 hours continuing professional development (CPD) each year and there is evidence that this minimum is generally being exceeded. The Business Interchange programme is providing opportunities for the workforce to update vocational skills through employer placements. There is early evidence from Ofsted inspections of the benefits of these reforms to teaching practice and learners.</p>
