The Government have asked the FSA to look at how new mortgages should be treated where the value of the loan exceeds the value of the property. The FSA has stated that it will publish a paper in September on mortgage regulation which will consider product regulation including maximum loan-to-value and loan-to-income caps.</p>

When I bought my house many years ago my mortgage was 70 per cent of the value and two and half times my salary, with my employer certifying that that was the case. Does my noble friend agree that if that had stayed the practice of the mortgage lenders, we would not have had to face most of the difficulties that we now face?</p>

However, there are also other areas of difficulty around self-certified loans, the acquisition of mortgage books of loans and the buy-to-let area. Banks will need to learn a number of lessons in how they approach the financing of home ownership.</p>

How does that fit in with what he is telling us now? For example, the banks were lending on commercial terms to unsuitable borrowers when house prices were very high. Now they are apparently going to be lending 90 per cent or even 100 per cent on houses whose prices are quite a bit lower. But presumably those loans will go only to suitable borrowers. Are the Government going to intervene?</p>

<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="090421108000008"></a><b><a name="90421-0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="090421108000290"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, the question of suitability, regardless of whether it applies to banks in which the Government have a temporary shareholding or to other banks, must be a matter for determination by the boards and management of those banks together with the regulators. The FSA&#146;s mortgage-regulation regime requires firms to lend responsibly; to satisfy themselves that borrowers have the ability to repay their mortgage; and to ensure that borrowers have full information about the products they are considering purchasing. That applies to banks regardless of whether the Government have a shareholding.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="090421108000009"></a><b><a name="90421-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="090421108000291"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, I am sure that the whole nation will be grateful that the FSA will produce a paper on this issue in September. However, does that not reflect an alarming lack of urgency? Can the Minister give any good reason why new mortgages should amount to more than 85 per cent of the value of the house? If he cannot, will he instruct the FSA to incorporate that into its guidance before September?</p>

<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="090421108000010"></a><b><a name="90421-0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090421108000292"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, raises a number of questions. I think that the lack of urgency is due to some extent to the fact that this particular horse has bolted. The proportion of loans being extended for more than 90 per cent of the value is now very low and a very high proportion of those loans are to borrowers with existing loans who are rolling the loans over or taking them from one mortgage provider to another. To some extent there is an enforced demand in place. That is an example of where the value of the property is quite close to the loan value but the loan is nevertheless required as a force of necessity.</p>

<a name="90421-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="090421108000011"></a>There are other circumstances that would discourage one from being prescriptive. For instance, a loan-to-value ratio could be high but there could be a third-party guarantee; or there could be a low multiple of earnings with a high degree of confidence and conviction about those earnings. So I think that we need to be slightly careful about broad-brush generalisations. However, market practice has certainly seen a significant reduction in the availability of high loan-to-value mortgages.</p>

The sources of non-institutionalised lending really are quite limited now. For instance, the fact that banks are no longer securitising loans and selling them on, but rather retaining ownership of a higher proportion of their loans, with the responsibility that goes with that, is a force for more prudent and conservative lending.</p>

Those low interest rates have been passed on to mortgage borrowers, so the cost of debt service has declined. However, unfortunately, there are people who are experiencing difficulties. That is why I am delighted to see that, this morning, my right honourable friend the Minister for Housing introduced and announced the details of the homeowner mortgage support scheme, with very substantial support from our major lenders. It will do much to ease the problems and difficulties of those who find themselves with a temporary difficulty in servicing their mortgage, although that must always be subject to independent advice. We do not want to see people accumulating even larger liabilities, which they will have even more difficulty in servicing in the future.</p>

I have greatly appreciated my conversations with him about transport issues, on which he is a great expert. I agree with almost all his questions, but I cannot speak for my right honourable friend the Chancellor in terms of commitments we are able to make in the future.

That was immensely exciting for me but I think is a common occurrence for my noble friend. I, of course, embrace warmly the need for further investment in the railways and further investment is being put in place. As regards models for the future, when I finished my national tour at the York Railway Museum I was fortunate to arrive just as the Tornado was arriving on one of its trips out of London. There were vast crowds to see it. However, my particular concern was to have my picture taken next to the Japanese bullet train, which is a recent addition to the collection at the York Railway Museum, and which I have to say I see as rather more of a model for the future.</p>

A key issue as we develop high-speed services is that we can get fast running all the way to Scotland.

However, he has put his finger on the fact that the problem that we have in the global economy at the moment is inextricably linked to the contraction of credit as a consequence of the difficulties that the world&#146;s major banks have found themselves in. That is why this problem is not limited to the United Kingdom, but is global. Restoring the banks&#146; ability to lend through recapitalisation, managing their damaged assets, strengthening their funding and making liquidity available is at the heart of the programme that not only have we followed in this country but has been followed by other countries which have seen the wisdom of the action that we have taken.</p>

But let us look at the facts. Over the 10 years to 1996, GDP per capita in the UK was the lowest in the G7. Over the following 10 years, it was the second highest in the G7. Since 1997, which was an important year, as no doubt the noble Lord remembers, UK real GDP per capita has increased by more than any other G7 economy. That was a tribute to the masterful management of the economy by my right honourable friend who was the Chancellor in those days, who is now our Prime Minister.</p>

Does the Minister accept that a number of contributory factors are home-grown, such as the lax regulation of banks and building societies over a number of years, the ratcheting up of budget deficits during the boom and the Government extolling ever higher and excessive pay levels for top corporate executives? Does he further accept that if the Government were to accept even a small proportion of the responsibility for some of these things, they might be in a better position to argue convincingly for recovery?</p>

Clearly, some were not and some were disgraceful. Does the Minister agree that there is a great need to endorse the public&#146;s right to peaceful protest, and that some of the culture that has grown up in police forces&#151;filming people at protests as if they were suspects and, in the case of the Nottinghamshire police, raiding a planning meeting for a protest before anything had happened&#151;are examples of protest having become, among some elements of the police, somewhat equated to criminal activity?</p>

Before I say anything more, we should not lose sight of the fact that, the week before the G20, the &#147;Put People First&#148; demonstration had 30,000 people marching through London, and that went off peacefully. We should also not lose sight of this: during the course of the G20, thousands of officers acted absolutely professionally and proportionately, and thousands of people were able to demonstrate peacefully on our streets, while criminal activity in the rest of the metropolis was kept to an absolute minimum. The police maintained high levels of security; we should be extremely proud of them. That is not to excuse criminal acts, and investigations are now taking place on those particulars. However, in general we are very well served by our police. I am proud of them, and my general approach is that they are on our side. They are our people, and that is the way to do it.</p>

In the light of that, can the Minister reassure your Lordships&#146; House that all of those options will be explored in the forthcoming review? For the record, I do not personally applaud those methods, but the Minister may agree that a through review of the pros and cons of those options will equip us better to comment on our present approach, with all its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

He will look particularly at containment and kettling, an area where there has been some debate; at liaison with the media, where the issue of dealing with journalists has not always gone quite right; and at communication with the public and protestors, where there is clearly a need for more dialogue.

The Minister, I and others who are active in the Bill&#146;s passage will therefore wish to see business speedily transacted.</p>

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="090421108000067"></a>In many ways, Amendment A282ZA relates to the most important element of this part of the Bill&#151;namely, how we bring it all together and actually create the coastal path. I am aware of the dialogue that we have already established. It has been very useful to have the briefings on this aspect of the Bill. The Government have sought to address the locality issue directly in their briefing note headed, &#147;Role of local authorities and extent of their consultation&#148;<I>.</I> I understand it to accept much of my argument. Indeed, I think the Government have it in mind that local authorities should play a key part. The Minister said as much when we were last in Committee, in response to an amendment from my noble friend Lady Byford.</p>

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="090421108000068"></a>My amendment seeks to enshrine that role by placing this involvement on the face of the Bill. Noble Lords following the debates on this Bill will know how important I consider the role of local authorities in ensuring the delivery of a coastal path that provides the general public with access to the coast for them to enjoy and use safely. At the same time, the line of the route must be such as to minimise the pressure on those in occupation and ownership of the route. Local knowledge must be the key, and ensuring where possible that there is agreement at local level will encourage both the speedy setting up of the designated path and buy-in from all those involved.</p>

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="090421108000069"></a>For many reasons, I believe the experience of local authorities will be vital to this process. Most important of all is the local knowledge and experience that those currently responsible for the footpath network can bring to the task. It is certain that they would have an easier dialogue with landowners and local interest groups than a Whitehall-based government agency. I think that Natural England itself recognises this; it is about delivering what the Bill seeks as efficiently and painlessly as possible. Using local authorities in the

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="090421108000070"></a>The Committee needs to remember that this Bill deals with the awkward remainder. While much of the coast already has coastal paths&#151;many created by custom&#151;other stretches have been created by Highway Act powers under which compensation has been given to occupiers and landowners. However, this is a different matter. The good will of landowners, farmers and other occupiers of the land is vital to bring the remainder into existence. I believe that local authorities will have better access to that good will.</p>

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="090421108000071"></a>We should not forget that this Bill builds paths in what are often the most difficult cases. It is not for nothing that this is so, as by definition, what we are catering for are those places where access up to now has not been possible. We have to reconcile all those complex aspects of the Bill which our debates up to now have brought to the Committee&#146;s notice.</p>

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="090421108000072"></a>I am certain that access to the coastal path itself from existing inland roads and pathways is a key to its success in achieving its purpose as a recreational resource for the public to enjoy. It can be of no use to have a path stuck out of reach from the locality. That is why locally organised bus services and car parks are an equal part of the strategy. The most enjoyable walks are circuits, and few will walk long distances of more than 10 miles along the length of the route. Therefore, access to the coastal path itself is important, and integration is vital. Indeed, in our previous debate on this subject, the Minister mentioned how important this was for the success of the south-west coastal path. Given that the Minister has said that his belief is that such connections are not part of the coastal path and would have to be provided by local authorities at their expense, what encouragement will they be given to provide connections? Is this not, of its own, yet another reason why local authorities should be in the key role of drawing up the line of the path?</p>

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="090421108000073"></a>I am not sure where in the Bill this matter is best addressed but I am sure that the best agent for delivering a coastal path that is readily accessible for casual walkers is the local authority. By all means let Natural England badge the route. It can ensure consistency&#151;or, to use an analogy, exercise editorial control&#151;but it is not the best author of the detail. It will be Natural England that presents the final report but meanwhile it should be prepared to commission and fund local authorities to designate the line. County councils or the appropriate right-of-way authority will link in with local services for which they are responsible, such as bus routes. Likewise, they can liaise with district councils over the provision of car parks and the development of facilities.</p>

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="090421108000074"></a>This is to increase the recreational asset value of the coastal path for the benefit of all users. There are likely to be situations which, without proper precautions, may put users of the path in danger. Local knowledge will minimise this. Paths will be subject to seasonal pressures, which may be linked to wildlife, and in some cases tidal pressures, and alternative routes will need to be considered and managed. Furthermore, if use is

<a name="90421-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="090421108000075"></a>Whatever, the utility and durability of the path will be highly dependent on it being placed in the optimum balance, taking account of proximity to the coast, accessibility and ease of use for the public in general. Local knowledge is the way to facilitate that, and it can be best brought to bear by local authorities. We know from the Countryside and Rights of Way Act that much time was expended on appeals, and noble Lords will not want a repeat of that. Agreement between a local authority and landowners and occupiers will be much easier to obtain and will avoid unnecessary dispute. This is surely what local buy-in means to this great project. It need not be seen as a threat; if constructed in a sensitive manner, it can be a facility from which local communities can only gain. That is why, if we want this path to be a success, we should write the role of local authorities into the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

The underlying ethos behind it is, I think, the same as that of the Conservative amendment, although the wording is slightly different. Our amendment would insert the words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="090421108000233"></a>&#147;Before preparing a report, Natural England may enter into an arrangement with one or more relevant access authorities in which the authority or authorities, or persons employed by them, carry out some or all of the preparatory work on its behalf&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421108000216"></a>Whatever the wording and wherever it should be placed in the Bill, it is our view that, for many of the reasons set out by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and others, it is important that the role of local access authorities in preparing these reports and maintaining the route is acknowledged in the Bill.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90421-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90421-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="090421108000077"></a>The noble Lord mentioned that the Government have already said that local authorities will be closely involved, and that is true. Indeed, Natural England has set out the same thing in a very helpful document. Taking the scheme as a whole, I think that the draft coastal access scheme, published by Natural England in January, instils a lot of confidence in the words in the Bill. These people have looked at the Bill and thought that it is a bit thin&#151;that it is an outline Bill rather than a framework Bill which includes all the detail it should. Reading what Natural England proposes puts a great deal of confidence behind what is being proposed here. Nevertheless, our view is that some of what is in this scheme should be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="090421108000078"></a>Paragraph 3.1.2 of the scheme states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="090421108000234"></a>&#147;We aim to work closely with access authorities throughout the process of alignment and establishment of the coastal access rights, combining our nationally consistent approach with their detailed understanding of local circumstances. We will therefore discuss with them the basis for dividing up the coast that they cover and the sequence in which each stretch should be implemented&#148;.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="090421108000079"></a>Paragraph 3.1.3 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000250"></a>&#147;once started, work with the access authority should continue until a report (or reports) has been completed for the whole of the coastline within the authority&#146;s area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000217"></a>There are further references as well.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1373"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1373</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90421-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="090421108000080"></a>In December 2008, Natural England published another excellent document, on coastal access supplementary information. Paragraph 5.5 states that its,</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000251"></a>&#147;current estimates for staff and support costs&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000218"></a>include the cost of this in access authorities. This is based on the working assumption that the access authorities will manage the local alignment field work and consultation and implement it once it has been approved. It is clear that Natural England believes that all the donkey work in producing the coastal path and maintaining it will be carried out by the local access authorities. Natural England will supervise and manage and perhaps put one or two people in on the ground to co-ordinate and manage what the local authority is doing. That is fine because it provides people locally with a great deal of confidence that the consultation and careful work with the landowners, user interests, natural history interests and everyone else will be carried out properly.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="090421108000081"></a>There will be a great deal of further confidence in the Bill if this proposal is included. It does not have to be more than two or three lines, but if it is in the Bill, it cannot be changed and will happen in the way that Natural England and the Government want to do it. In five or 10 years&#146; time, the existing management of Natural England may not exist. The present Government will not exist, but their successors will. There will be a new Secretary of State and so on. What appears in the Bill is crucial in these cases. I have therefore put forward my amendment, and I support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor.</p>

My experience is that in these situations personal relations matter more than anything else. It is crucial to know the right people to talk to, how to get people to talk to one another, which organisations take what attitude and how they get on with local landowners and managers, and all that kind of thing. As the noble Lord who has just spoken knows as a councillor, local government people know how to do that as well as anyone. I cannot imagine that Natural England, being parachuted in as representatives of the Government of the day, is likely to get the same kind of response. It would be much more difficult but very much in its interests if it did this through local government and if that were allowed in the Bill. It should be in the Bill. It makes sense of local government and it makes sense for this exercise.</p>

I agree with the noble Lords and the noble Baroness on the role of local government, particularly the access authorities. I agree that local knowledge must be the key. I also agree that constructive dialogue with all the parties, including the land owners, is much to be preferred as it is likely to lead to a more consensual approach. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, suggested, we undoubtedly wish to avoid some of the problems that have arisen with the CROW Act, particularly in relation to the appeal system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="090421108000084"></a>I also very much agree that good local authorities should enhance personal relationships and help to get agreement about the coastal path. I also agree that access to the path and circular walks by public transport and so on is very important, and that there needs to be proper integration. The role of local authorities is very important to that. We see local authorities being extremely important pastors in the costal access project.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="090421108000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, rightly referred to Natural England&#146;s document on the draft scheme, which refers explicitly to the role of local authorities. Schedule 19 to the Bill provides for the practical powers that are necessary to enable Natural England to identify, establish and maintain the English coastal route. I can confirm that, wherever practical, Natural England will enter into agreements with access authorities to carry out the work of establishing the route on the ground.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="090421108000086"></a>In addition, county councils and county district councils are statutory consultees under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, and as a result must be consulted by Natural England before it draws up a report on a section of coast in their area. In addition, under regulations that will be made under new Section 55E in Clause 292, Natural England will be required to give access authorities for the particular area covered by the coastal access report the opportunity to make representations on that report. I well understand why noble Lords wish to have confirmation of this by ensuring that it appears in the Bill. I have said that it is our intention that local authorities will be key partners in implementing coastal access, but in the light of the views that have been expressed today, I am happy to take away the points that have been made and consider further what we might be able to put into legislation to answer noble Lords&#146; concerns about this matter. I do not disagree in principle with anything that both noble Lords and the noble Baroness have said this afternoon.</p>

The amendments seek to clarify who is considered to have a relevant interest in land. The Bill is confusing in two respects; the relevant definitions of Clauses 287 and 292 are not the same as the definitions that are used in the CROW Act, and even more confusingly, despite the similarity between the schemes&#151;indeed, the Bill uses CROW Act mechanisms  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1375"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>extensively&#151;the two definitions are not even the same as each other. The question of who has a relevant interest in land is not trivial. We will come to the much anticipated debate over the right to an appeal, but even with the current provisions in the Bill it is acknowledged that those with a relevant interest in land should have certain privileges when it comes to the right to be consulted and to make representations. Indeed, the Minister confirmed that in an earlier debate, so I expect him to agree to this position.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="090421108000089"></a>In all the enthusiasm for establishing a coastal access route, which we all agree is a good thing, we must not forget that we are extending the public sphere into private ground. Inevitably, there will be an impact not only on those who hold the land outright but on those who currently use it. Quite rightly, the CROW Act considered that those holding a licence or agreement on the land also have an interest. They have often paid significant amounts of money for the right to undertake various activities. Why have the Government chosen to exclude them from having an interest taken into account, or is this just an inadvertent error in drafting the Bill? I beg to move.</p>

There is an issue to consider here, and I hope to be able to convince the noble Lord that we have thought through these issues very carefully, and that where we differentiate from the CROW Act it is for good reason and not because of any slip on the part of the Government. We will be considering a number of general issues relating to the consultation on Natural England&#146;s report, and I do not want to pre-empt those discussions now.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="090421108000092"></a>This group of amendments specifically seeks to extend the definition of a relevant interest in affected land to include those with other interests. That is because, as the noble Lord has said, the CROW legislation provides for that, and this legislation should follow it. This is an important point because such persons must be consulted under new Section 55D before the report by Natural England is prepared, and are then able to make representations which go in full to the Secretary of State. However, the CROW legislation includes other interests inland such as rights of common, rights of grazing and sporting rights. These interests were particularly relevant to the types of land involved in CROW itself. They include open country, which is defined in the Act as mountain, moor, heath and down, as well as registered common land. The CROW land includes a number of grouse moors, which make shooting interests pertinent to the legislation, while rights of common were particularly important as the mapping process involved mapping areas of registered common land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="090421108000093"></a>The situation at the coast, which is what this part of the legislation is concerned with, and the implementation of the coastal access duty, is quite different. A great number of different interests&#151;access interests as well  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1376"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1376</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as landed interests&#151;are concerned with the coast. Moreover, the land types and the different interests which will be affected by the proposals for the coast are much less uniform than those identified for the CROW legislation. We believe, therefore, that it is appropriate to have a different definition of relevant interests which ensures that those likely to be particularly affected by giving public access to land at the coast are consulted and can make representations on the report, which then go in full to the Secretary of State. The Committee will recognise that these are very important provisions indeed. Thus it has been with great care rather than through inadvertence that we have identified and set out in the Bill the people who it is appropriate to include within the definition of those with a relevant interest in affected land. These are set out in Clause 287 and new Section 55J in Clause 292; namely, the owner of the land, a leaseholder and a person in lawful occupation of the land.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="090421108000094"></a>I shall make a cardinal point in saying that this is the most appropriate approach to take for coastal land. I hope the noble Lord will accept that the Government have thought about these issues very seriously. In many ways what he suggests might have been looked on as the easier course of just following the definition in the CROW Act. But the coastal path and coastal land affect different interests and because of that difference I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment, with the reassurance that the Government have considered this issue with the greatest care.</p>

<a name="090421108000096"></a><b><a name="90421-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="090421108000362"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I will also speak to Amendments A286, A287, A289. A290, A291, A293, A294, A295, A296, A297 and A299, which stand in my name and that of my noble friend. This group also contains some amendments from the Conservatives and the government amendment which we look forward to hearing about in due course.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="090421108000097"></a>These amendments are about the coastal access scheme, a national scheme which will be put together by Natural England. As I have said, we have had the benefit of seeing the draft scheme, which is already very considerably developed. That is good news for those of us debating it here today. We do not always get information in quite such detail about what is going to happen as a result of the legislation which we are discussing. Natural England is to be congratulated on having got the draft scheme to the stage that it is at, although obviously it is still subject to amendment, not least by this legislation when it is finally passed by Parliament. The scheme will be approved by the Secretary of State, who lays out how Natural England will produce reports and create coastal access&#151;the route and the marginal land or spreading room&#151;in each part of the coast. The Bill says that Natural England must prepare a scheme setting out the approach it will take. That seems to be fairly vague wording and Amendment A284 suggests that, instead of talking about the approach, it should consist of the procedures and the policies. This is partly probing to find how much policy this document will contain and how much it will be a procedural and operational document, as well as suggesting more exact wording.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="090421108000098"></a>Amendment A286 says that the coastal access scheme must require Natural England to discharge the coastal access duty by means of preparing reports under Section 51 of the 1949 Act. This is for clarity. There seems to be an omission here that ought to be filled.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="090421108000099"></a>Amendment A287 probes the question of the status of the coastal access scheme, and the Conservative amendments probe in a similar area. At the moment the Bill says that the scheme requires the approval of the Secretary of State but parliamentary approval is not required. The government amendment that we are going to discuss says that it has to be laid before Parliament; obviously each House, if a document is laid before it, can discuss it and make recommendations, but it is not subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="090421108000100"></a>Again, what kind of document is it? If it is a policy document, like a planning policy document, then it is probably not right that it should be subject to parliamentary approval because policy is a matter for the Government. If, however, it is a procedural and operational document that sets out the ways in which the coastal access proposals will be put forward, then it ought to be a statutory instrument. At the moment, it appears to be a bit of one and a bit of the other. The amendment probes just how far parliamentary scrutiny of the scheme will be appropriate, because it will be the key document in putting together the structure for how the new regime is going to work.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="090421108000101"></a>Amendment A289 says that when the coastal access scheme is put to the Secretary of State for approval, the Secretary of State would have to give reasons for   


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1378"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>his approval or rejection of the scheme. I do not need to say any more about that. The reasons for putting forward the amendment are self-evident.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="090421108000102"></a>Amendment A299 says that the Secretary of State&#146;s reasons would have to be published at the same time as the scheme, as approved by him. Again, the reasons are self-evident. If the Secretary of State has to put forward reasons, they should be published.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="090421108000103"></a>Amendment A290 probes what happens if a scheme is rejected. We are suggesting that a new scheme should be produced within 12 months. It would be a disaster if the scheme were rejected, and one hopes that that situation would never occur. But if it occurs, what happens and what is the timescale?</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="090421108000104"></a>Amendments A291 and A293 probe the curious wording in the Bill that suggests that there could be more than one scheme. It is not clear how there could be more than one, but the use of the phrase &#147;a scheme&#148; suggests that there could. We are simply suggesting that &#147;a&#148; should be replaced by &#147;the&#148; because we understand that there will be only one scheme at any given time. The appropriate article is therefore the definite, not the indefinite.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="090421108000105"></a>Amendment A294 would require Natural England, before preparing or revising a scheme, to publish its intention to do so and to consult appropriate people.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="090421108000106"></a>Amendment A296 talks about the appropriate persons to be consulted on schemes and suggests that they should include,</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000254"></a>&#147;representatives of ... persons with a relevant interest in coastal land&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000221"></a>as we have just discussed with regard to the previous group of amendments,</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000255"></a>&#147;local access forums ... relevant recreational users and conservation interests, and ... access authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000222"></a>It is common sense that that would happen anyway but, if the scheme is going to get general acceptance and consensus, it ought to be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="090421108000107"></a>Amendment A299 says that if there are modifications by the Secretary of State when the scheme is published, the reasons for those modifications should be published.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="090421108000108"></a>This is a long group and these are quite complicated and technical amendments, but in practice the reasons why we are putting them forward are pretty evident in each case, so I will say no more. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="090421108000109"></a><b><a name="90421-0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090421108000363"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is correct. This is a long and complex group of amendments but it is designed to achieve a straightforward objective; namely, scrutiny and transparency. The amendments are designed to increase the transparency of those operations which will be necessary to the process of decision-making surrounding the creation of a coastal access scheme.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="090421108000110"></a>Amendment A288 ensures that any scheme which the Secretary of State has approved must be laid before both Houses of Parliament. It is right for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny to be applied to such an important decision. We are grateful that the Government have conceded in principle by tabling Amendment A292.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1379"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90421-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="090421108000111"></a>Further amendments in this group increase the transparency of this process. Amendment A289A requires that if the Secretary of State rejects the scheme he must notify Natural England of his reasons. This is of the utmost importance to ensure a public and fair process. It makes sense that there should be full and open dialogue between the Secretary of State and all those engaged in this task. Does the Minister agree that if the Secretary of State can reject a scheme prepared by Natural England, it makes sense for Natural England to be informed of the reasons? Does he accept that if under subsection 2(b) the Secretary of State can issue a notice requiring a new scheme to be produced, that will be very difficult if Natural England is not aware why the first scheme was rejected? Common sense suggests that this is the only way that Natural England can get the scheme right. If, as would be sensible, the scheme is approved in sections, this would enable Natural England to hear the Secretary of State&#146;s view and learn from it.</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="090421108000112"></a>We agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that Natural England should publish the reasons the Secretary of State gave for approving the scheme. Our amendment A299A builds on this and means that Natural England must publish the reasons that the Secretary of State gave for rejecting the scheme. This will improve transparency. It will ensure that all parties concerned have the opportunity to question the legitimacy of the reasons and thus reinforce the need for decisions to be based on absolute fairness. All parties should be in the picture. This is not a process that will benefit from deals behind closed doors. Does the Minister agree that it is right that the opportunity for scrutiny is provided?</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="090421108000113"></a>Further to this, Amendment A295A requires that Natural England must not only publish the scheme, or sections of the scheme, but also put it out to public consultation. The Minister must agree with me that a coastal access scheme will affect a very large number of disparate groups of people. Does he also agree that it is right that these, often local, people should be allowed and indeed encouraged to use their knowledge to question and improve the scheme?</p>

<a name="90421-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="090421108000114"></a>We welcome the Government&#146;s Amendments A292 and A298 in the interests of increased scrutiny, both by Parliament and by the public. I look forward to hearing the Minister describe the different methods of publication which Natural England may deploy. My only slight reservation in this area is that I hope the choice of media used to publish the scheme would reflect a concern to widen access to it rather than narrow it. What safeguards would the Minister consider appropriate to ensure that this was the case?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="090421108000116"></a>My Amendment A289A is a simple probing amendment. The use of the indefinite article suggests that the Government feel there may be more than one case. If this is so, will the Minister explain the Government&#146;s thinking? My Amendment A146B covered the same relative point, and I hope that the Minister can clarify it for me.</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1380"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1380</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90421-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="090421108000118"></a>First, the amendments are helpful in teasing out some details of how the scheme will be taken forward with appropriate parliamentary scrutiny. We are responding to concerns raised in your Lordships&#146; House today, and earlier by the departmental Select Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, regarding the scheme and the involvement of Parliament. The scheme would benefit from the input of Members of both Houses. That is why I will be moving Amendment A292, which would require the Secretary of State, once he has approved the scheme, to lay a copy before Parliament and, where that scheme is revised, a copy of the revised scheme. This is the procedure recommended by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The amendment would provide Natural England with an opportunity to take account of any suggestions on the scheme arising from debates by noble Lords and Members of the other place. The scheme could then, if necessary, be revised under Clause 288(4), subject to further approval by the Secretary of State and laying before Parliament.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="090421108000119"></a>I will also move Amendment A298, which clarifies that Natural England may publish the scheme in such a manner as it considers appropriate. I fully accept the point of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, about wanting that to be seen as a way of widening access rather than it becoming less accessible. I agree with that, and will ensure that it is communicated to Natural England. However, my understanding is that the draft scheme was published on the internet and hard copies were made available on request. That does not seem to be a bad start. I know that I should not have mentioned the internet. I am obviously in danger of provoking one of your Lordships&#146; usual debates on the matter. I take the point that we want these documents and the scheme to be accessible, and it is important that they are.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="090421108000120"></a>On the other amendments in this group, Amendment A284, which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has spoken to, refers to &#147;procedures and policies&#148; rather than &#147;approach&#148;. As the noble Lord said, he has tabled it as a probing amendment. We prefer the wording of the Bill to that of the noble Lord&#146;s, because his would take a rather prescriptive approach. He asked me what I expect to be in Natural England&#146;s scheme. We would expect the scheme to set out in some detail how the implementation process is expected to work, the key principles of the alignment of the route and how they will be applied to a number of coastal land covers and uses. The draft scheme itself gives a good indication of what we would expect the final scheme to cover. It gives an indication of the procedure that will be followed, and also a fuller explanation of the policy. It sets out a general approach, so it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to make the final decision, albeit&#151;with the benefit of the government amendments&#151;with an opportunity for scrutiny of the scheme as it is laid before Parliament.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="090421108000121"></a>On Amendments A289, A299, A299A and A289ZA, the Secretary of State will approve the scheme only if he is satisfied that Natural England has clearly set out the approach it will take when discharging its coastal access duty. If the Secretary of State is not so satisfied, he will reject the scheme and give notice to Natural England, under subsection (2)(b), to prepare and submit  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1381"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1381</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a revised scheme and give Natural England his reasons for doing so. Where the Secretary of State has rejected a scheme, the current provisions in Clause 288 provide some flexibility for him to set a time for any revised scheme to be submitted. The Secretary of State may specify a timescale for the submission of a new scheme in the notice that he gives Natural England under Clause 288(2)(b), so the legislation is currently flexible enough to allow the Secretary of State to indicate the appropriate timescale for submitting a new scheme.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="090421108000122"></a>Amendments A291, A293, A298 and A299A deal with the question of whether we have got it right with our use of the words &#147;a&#148; and &#147;the&#148;. I have gone into this matter in great detail and have been convinced that the wording is correct. First, I reassure noble Lords that we are not talking about a whole series of different schemes; we are talking about one scheme. The point is that at the beginning, when Natural England starts to prepare a scheme, it is &#147;a&#148; scheme because the preparatory work is still being done. Once Natural England submits this scheme to the Secretary of State, it becomes &#147;the&#148; scheme. While I, too, queried it because it seems illogical, there is consistency and a reason for it.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="090421108000123"></a>I move on to Amendments A294, A295 and A296 which adds a list. The scheme or revised scheme must be approved by the Secretary of State. In doing so he will take into account the extent and coverage of Natural England&#146;s consultation. Natural England will be required to consult on its proposed scheme before it submits it to the Secretary of State for his approval. The current provisions in subsection (6) of this clause already provide for Natural England to publish the scheme or revised scheme as soon as is reasonably practical after it is approved.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="090421108000124"></a>On the question of giving reasons, if the Secretary of State has agreed to a scheme that has been proposed by Natural England, I am not sure&#151;or certainly not convinced&#151;that it is necessary for the Secretary of State to give reasons for approval. On the more substantive point of the Secretary of State rejecting a scheme, of course he would expect to say why it is rejected. There should be no doubt about that, although one would always hope that there had been a co-operative process so that it was unnecessary for such a scheme to be rejected. We must have the provision in case there is a problem, but I have no doubt that, if a scheme were to be rejected and the Secretary of State called&#151;in the way that I have described&#151;for a new scheme to be put forward, with an indicative timetable if necessary, Natural England would clearly need to know what was wrong with its original proposal.</p>

I have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble Baroness said. I agree with her. The implication of what she says is that not everyone uses the internet. I think I said, as I attempted to correct myself, that I fully accept the general point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that in moving this amendment I seek to ensure that these documents are accessible. It has to be left to Natural England to decide how that should be done but I am happy to make the House&#146;s sentiments clear to that body; namely, that the internet should not be the only way in which its documents should be made available and communicated.</p>

However, when I saw it on the internet, I discovered that it was quite a big document and I did not have a colour printer at the time. I rang Natural England or, rather, the numbers that I could find on the website, and the people who were responsible for distributing Natural England&#146;s documents said that they had never heard of it. However, that was some time ago. The first we saw of the printed document, as opposed to what we printed out ourselves, was at the very useful briefing sessions that we had with the Minister and his Bill team. Comments were made then that these documents were rather difficult to get hold of and not very many had been printed. There is no doubt that there is nowadays a tendency to assume that everybody can get it off the internet and perhaps most people now can. However, if it is a big document in full colour and you do not have adequate broadband, it is almost impossible to get.</p>

The Minister says that when Natural England starts to prepare a scheme, it is &#147;a scheme&#148;. I understand that. When it submits it, it becomes &#147;the scheme&#148;. The wording in the Bill follows that to some extent. It starts off in Clause 288(1) with preparing &#147;a scheme&#148;. It goes on in Clause 288(2) to refer to &#147;the scheme&#148;, which the Secretary of State may approve, with or without modifications, or reject. In Clause 288(4), which deals with revising it, it is &#147;a scheme&#148; again. It seems that at the revision stage it ought to be &#147;the scheme&#148;, because it is &#147;the scheme&#148; that has previously been adopted.</p>

<ul><a name="090421108000256"></a>&#147;prevents Natural England from surveying any land in connection with the preparation of such a report&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000224"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to probe the meaning of the phrase, &#147;surveying any land&#148;. For the purposes of this probing, our amendment adds to that phrase the words,</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000257"></a>&#147;carrying out any other research, or undertaking any consultations and discussions with any persons or authorities&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90421-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="090421108000141"></a>It seems to me that a broad definition of the words &#147;surveying any land&#148; would include carrying out any research off the land, which could be desk research, library research, or talking to anyone about it. Common sense would allow that to happen. Common sense also suggests that this kind of activity ought to be allowed in preparation for the first phase of coastal access reports, even if the coastal access scheme itself is still in the late stages of being produced and approved. That is the purpose of the amendment. I do not intend to speak to Amendment A322.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="090421108000142"></a>Amendment A323 is to probe what happens in the preparation of a coastal access report if there is already an approved long-distance route on that section of coast. The amendment suggests:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="090421108000243"></a>&#147;If the report is in relation to a part of the English coast where there is already an approved long-distance route, Natural England must in preparing the report have regard to the existence of that route and all relevant circumstances relating to it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421108000225"></a>That applies in two places in particular. There may be others, but the two that I have identified are the south-west and north Yorkshire, where the Cleveland Way follows the coast of the North York Moors for quite a long distance. In those circumstances, what is the relationship between the existing long-distance route and the new coastal access long-distance route that will be produced in those areas? This is a probing amendment to seek an explanation of that.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="090421108000143"></a>I do not understand what Amendment A351 means, and I do not understand why it is in this group; it has floated here somehow. I do not intend to speak to it. I beg to move Amendment A301.</p>

On Amendment A301, the provision in Clause 288(9) will enable Natural England to survey land in preparation for submitting a report before there is an approved scheme, so it can do some preparatory work in advance of the scheme being finalised and approved. Before preparing a report it will, of course, consult people, but those consultations must not pre-empt or prejudice the proper consultations that Natural England will be required to hold once the scheme has been approved. The noble Lord indicated that this might be a probing amendment, so I hope he will recognise that we have good reasons for drafting the Bill as we have.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="090421108000148"></a>On Amendment A323, I hope that the noble Lord will accept that we are seeking to preserve the flexibility for Natural England to draw up a report for short sections of the route that do not amount to an extensive journey. In indicating that he is not now pressing Amendment A322, he, perhaps, accepts that. However, Natural England will need to take any previously approved long-distance route into account when it prepares its report; the burden of the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in this short debate was, I think, that there is no point in Natural England being involved in such additional work.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="090421108000149"></a>Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will accept, first, that we consider we have examined the issues raised in his quite interesting and probing amendments. We are concerned that Natural England will be involved in developing its report through necessary preparation, which cannot be done without consultation, but that must not pre-empt the consultation that takes place once the scheme is approved. Secondly, I hope he will accept that Amendment A323 will not need to be in the Bill because, as it is drafted, Natural England will need to take account of any previously approved long-distance route. I think that was the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor.</p>

I want to make two points. On my point about surveying being read in a wider sense, I think the Minister said that nothing prevents Natural England speaking or discussing that with anybody, or doing any necessary research off the land itself, but that once the formal processes of investigating particular coastal parts are taking place, the consultations and discussions clearly have to take place under what is in the Bill; they will be legally necessary and cannot be pre-empted. If that is what the Minister said, then I thank him and am happy with that response.</p>

<a name="90421-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="090421108000151"></a>My other point is on the south-west coastal path. I get a general feeling from many noble Lords that everything is perfect with that path at the moment, but it is not. The south-west coastal path is a wonderful thing and most of us have benefited from it at various times; nevertheless, parts of it have significant diversions inland, which one hopes that the Bill will, in due course, be able to remedy when looking at the south-west. Having said that we should know that not everything is absolutely perfect with that path, wonderful thing though it is, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="090421108000153"></a>In approaching this very important part of the coastal access scheme, I should put on record that I have no direct interest. I am not a dog owner. We all know a lot of dog owners; there may be many in the House who have exercised their dogs along some of the coastal footpaths, but I have not had the pleasure of doing so. I also put on record that I am not a member of or associated in any way with the Kennel Club. I say that although I have had some research undertaken by the Kennel Club for a particular reason. I understand from the club that an approach was made by departmental officials seeking the review and withdrawal of the amendments. That is rather surprising and worrying. If anyone should seek to withdraw my amendment, it should be me, not any outside organisation, which may or may not have provided information to enable me to move the amendment.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="090421108000154"></a>Anyone who has any experience of the countryside and, particularly, of the wilder countryside, must be well aware that dogs can be a major problem. They can provide considerable anxiety to both those concerned about the conservation of wildlife and to livestock farmers, especially at lambing time. Of course, lambing takes place earlier in Cornwall than in anywhere else in the country because of our delightful climate, but everywhere in the country, lambing is a very important part of the seasonal experience of working farmers. Therefore, it is not surprising that the National Farmers&#146; Union has expressed anxiety about the best way to deal with that potential problem. I cite the National Farmers&#146; Union briefing to your Lordships' House:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="090421108000248"></a>&#147;We welcome the commitment for Defra and Natural England to carry out further work with stakeholders on the best way to deal with dog control, which recognises that there are some shared interests here for example between bird conservation and farming ... Conditions vary along the coast and appropriate dog management will need to reflect that. Accordingly we also hope that the Government will be pressed to agree that there is a compelling need for a communications strategy on the management of dogs in the wider countryside, not just in coastal areas, run by Natural England in conjunction with other stakeholders&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421108000226"></a>In other words, even after the Bill passes from your Lordships' House, that is likely to be unfinished but important business. It is important not least because a  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1388"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1388</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>great number of our fellow citizens are dog owners, who greatly benefit from the fact that, at the moment, they can exercise their dogs in a wide variety of locations. I understand that there are about 7.3 million pet dogs in the United Kingdom cared for an estimated by 15 million people. That is not a minority interest. Government statistics show that dog walkers represent a large cross-section of society. Between one quarter and one half of all walkers are accompanied by dogs; that is certainly true in respect of some parts of our coastline. It is also true that dog owners benefit to a considerable extent in health terms from exercising their dogs. There are also social benefits for many individuals, families and communities.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="090421108000155"></a>Research shows that the biggest factor for owners choosing where to exercise their dogs is whether they can exercise them off-lead. If that is impossible locally, more than 40 per cent will drive somewhere else. They will take their car to go somewhere else. Obviously, that is not of great benefit to the environment. The Defra guidance accompanying the existing legislation states that local authorities should show that dog control orders are</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000258"></a>&#147;a necessary and proportionate response to problems caused by the activities of dogs and those in charge of them&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000227"></a>and to,</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000259"></a>&#147;balance the interest of those in charge of dogs against the interests of those affected by the activities of dogs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000228"></a>In practice, that has been largely ignored by many local authorities when they have taken a more restrictive approach. I understand that, although local authorities are bound under existing legislation to notify Natural England of any proposed dog control orders on access to land, very few appear to have done so. The Kennel Club tells me that, to date, at least 120 councils have implemented dog control orders, sometimes issuing as many as 100 orders in one local area. The Minister may be able to tell us whether, on that scale of orders, notification has been made to Natural England.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="090421108000156"></a>Therefore, in Amendment A302, we have designed a very specific, purpose-built provision for ensuring that dog owners exercising on the coastal access path do so in the most responsible way, taking account of the anxieties to which I referred earlier. We do not believe that the alternative, which appears in the Bill at the moment and to which we give attention in Amendment A363, which is in the form of amendments to the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, is appropriate, for the reasons I have given. It would seem to be using a sledgehammer to crack a really insubstantial nut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="090421108000157"></a>In my view, and I hope in the view of the Committee, it is much more appropriate to make specified, purpose-built, purpose-made provisions, along the lines of Amendment A302. We believe that is more effective and that it is in a more appropriate place than Amendment A359C in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach. We believe that laying full responsibility on dog owners to act really responsibly on the coastal footpath is the best way to ensure that they do so. I beg to move.</p>

One of the differences between the Government&#146;s proposals under this part of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill and its forerunner, the CROW Act, is that a great many of its regulations are to be implemented by secondary legislation, rather than being written on the face of the Bill. At present, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is placed within the main text of the Bill. I should have thought it more appropriate to table it as an amendment to Schedule 2 to the CROW Act, where we have attempted to place our Amendment A359C.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="090421108000159"></a>This amendment does reflect concerns of the NFU and we shall look carefully to see whether the noble Lord&#146;s proposals, if placed in Schedule 2, would be sufficient to allay our concerns. I do agree that this phraseology would need to be amended, as this schedule is entitled &#147;Restrictions to be observed by persons exercising the right of access&#148;. A new paragraph for coastal land could be inserted to include the provisions proposed by the noble Lord under Amendment A302, and this would be more consistent with the CROW Act approach. I presume that this should not provide too many difficulties for the Government, as the noble Lord&#146;s proposals almost exactly mirror those contained in paragraph 26 of the briefing on the proposed statutory instrument, which the Minister has so kindly sent us.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="090421108000160"></a>The withdrawal of the provision prohibiting access for dogs in the nesting season, contained in the proposed statutory instrument, in order to limit them to specific sites is an interesting suggestion, but, as there are likely to be more species of ground-nesting birds in the coastal area than in the mountains and on moor land, one does wonder who will have the jobs of designating to which areas the seasonal restrictions will apply.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="090421108000161"></a>I listened with some care to what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said about his Amendment A363, which at first struck me as being a bit too draconian. I was interested to hear what he said about the different approach of different local authorities to the use of these orders, but I should have thought that to remove the power entirely presumes that local authorities are likely to apply provisions of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act without good reason. That power, it seems to me, would be extremely important at times if there were outbreaks of zoonosis diseases to which dogs could contribute in a local area, such as E. coli, hydatid disease or salmonella. I expect that if rabies occurred, other legislation could be brought in. There is at least a sanction on local authorities, and perhaps the one to which the noble Lord referred should be aware that, if it is too draconian, it can be unelected. I hope that the Minister will address both the substance of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and the question of trying to maintain consistency with the CROW Act.</p>

This is an important example of the benefit that would ensue if we were assured that local authorities were going to be involved in this whole business. This is a very sensitive political issue, and local councillors are very used to discussing with the public what their dogs can and cannot do. I should have thought that that would solve the problem.</p>

Leaving aside the vexed question of privacy, on the whole, responsible public access to land does not interfere with the normal practical use of that land. There are exceptions to that, the most obvious being where animals other than humans are involved; for example, where there is livestock such as sheep and cattle and gates are left open, and in relation to habitat management for sensitive species, such as ground-nesting birds, mentioned by the noble Duke. Game and wildlife management generally is another example, and again, as the noble Duke said, wildlife is synonymous in most people&#146;s minds with the coastal strip.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="090421108000164"></a>However, these problems are particularly exacerbated when you come to the question of dogs. I declare an interest as a dog owner and as someone who, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has walked his dog along the south-west coast path in all four counties. I believe that we have to make coastal access a practical success. Therefore, although I sympathise with people who wish to walk their dogs, we have to make certain that we get this part of the Bill absolutely correct.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="090421108000165"></a>Whatever role I had in the implementation of the CROW Act, it was my publicly declared intent that in six, seven or eight years&#146; time people would look back and say, &#147;I wonder what all the fuss was about&#148;. On the whole, with one or two exceptions, after some teething problems I believe that that is probably the case. I hope that in a few years&#146; time people, especially landowners and farmers, will also be able to look back and say, &#147;This coastal access legislation has not made much difference to the management of my bit of land. It has given huge enjoyment to the public. It has also given us or our neighbours some benefit from the money that the visitors bring, and there have been no real problems&#148;. However, for them to say that, we have to deal with the question of dogs. I am very glad that the Government have acknowledged that and are intending to bring forward their own proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="090421108000166"></a>Amendment A302 is a very good first attempt but I do not know whether any noble Lords have ever tried to remonstrate with someone whose dog is running amok on a headland which has been specially sown for ground-nesting birds. I think they would have found that the words &#147;close control&#148; or &#147;promptly&#148;, when referring to bringing the dog back promptly to the owner, mean very different things to different people. As I said, the amendment is a very good first attempt but we have to try to improve on it. I cannot claim any magical solution to getting the balance right on this difficult question but I should be very happy to volunteer whatever experience I have had in order to try to find a practical and workable solution to this problem.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, was right when she said that, for a lot of this, we shall depend on local authorities and the practical experience they can bring, which is why I am a little resistant to the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, that we take the dog control order power away from local authorities. They can bring a lot of good common sense to what is sometimes a difficult matter, to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of interests.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="090421108000169"></a>Under the CROW Act, which will deliver the right of access to coastal land, a number of general restrictions have to be observed by persons exercising their right of access. These are set out in Schedule 2 to the Act, including, in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6, particular restrictions on the control of dogs. Amendment A302, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, would require the Natural England scheme to make provision for keeping dogs under close control. It would include within the Bill a description of what would be expected of any person in close control of a dog. Amendment A359C, proposed by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, would mean that a new paragraph might be inserted into Schedule 2 to the CROW Act to require a person to keep a dog under effective control.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="090421108000170"></a>I am sympathetic to the general principles expressed in both these amendments. I fully recognise the importance to land managers, to those accompanied by a dog, to other users and to responsible organisations such as the Kennel Club and the RSPB of a common understanding of the sorts of behaviour we should expect from a person in charge of a dog. However, we doubt that it is appropriate for the Bill to prescribe those details so closely regarding what the scheme should include. It is clear that the issue of dogs is an important one, it deserves some further detailed consultation and it is our view that this is best dealt with under the Section 3A order under CROW.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="090421108000171"></a>Noble Lords have referred already to the recently published paper which indicates the sort of changes we might propose to make to Schedule 2 to the CROW Act in the new Section 3A order. In one sense, it underpins the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, when he wishes us to be as practical as possible. Our argument is that using this mechanism and having the flexibility of secondary legislation will allow us to be flexible and practical in the light of circumstances.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="090421108000172"></a>On the very interesting point raised by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, concerning dogs to be kept on a lead during the nesting season, the CROW restriction related particularly to ground-nesting birds, which is relevant to moorland and heath-land. On the coast, there are many wildlife concerns&#151;winter roosting is very important in some cases&#151;so we need greater flexibility than CROW allows by using specific restrictions on dogs as appropriate. He then asks who is going to be able to provide the advice. My first port of call would be for the relevant local authorities to be able to do this, in consultation with all concerned interests. However, this is a consultation and if the noble Duke has specific ideas about this, I would be very happy to ensure that they are considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="090421108000173"></a>In this draft consultation, we have outlined our intention to include measures relating to restrictions on dogs and we think there should be a general restriction requiring a dog to be kept under effective control. By effective control, we propose that the keeper of a dog should keep it on relevant access land, and either keep it on a lead or keep it in sight and remain aware of its actions. A person should have reason to be confident that his or her dog will return reliably and promptly on command. We do not propose to make any change to the current position on open country that a person should keep his dog on a short lead. We mean by that a lead of not more than two metres in the vicinity of livestock and with any other relevant restrictions made under Chapter II of the CROW Act.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="090421108000174"></a>I hope noble Lords will feel that I have responded positively to this part of the debate. There will be further work and detailed consultation leading to an order being made&#151;</p>

Would it not be better for dog owners if the legislation on terms of access for dogs in the countryside and in the marine coastal area were in the same place; namely, Schedule 2 to the CROW Act, if it is amended? He has just given a fairly clear indication of what that might be. To have it all in the one place in legislation would simplify things for those who are trying to understand what they are supposed to do.</p>

<a name="090421108000176"></a><b><a name="90421-0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090421108000395"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I agree with that, although I suppose the issue we face is that we are bringing a Bill before Parliament which partly uses the CROW Act as the way in which the coastal access path can be provided. Because of that, some of the provisions of this Bill seek to amend the CROW Act. We are also taking advantage of the order-making power in the CROW Act to deal with dogs. I fully accept the substance of the noble Duke&#146;s point. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, gave some quite extraordinary statistics. I think he referred to 7.5 million dogs and 15 million dog owners or persons with an interest in dogs, although I am puzzled about how he reached that statistic. None the less, the number is impressive.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="090421108000177"></a>Clearly, very few dog owners will read the legislation, but it is clear that they need to understand what they are expected to do. On that basis I will take back the point raised by the noble Duke and ensure that, as part of the work of Natural England taking this forward, it gives great consideration to and works with the relevant bodies, such as the Kennel Club, to ensure that dog owners can be informed of the requirements in as straightforward a way as possible.</p>

<a name="90421-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="090421108000178"></a>Let me turn to dog control orders under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, thought that these proposals would be a sledgehammer to crack a nut. However, in the light of our consensus about the importance of local authorities in this area, because they are used to exercising dog control orders it is appropriate for them to be able to use those orders along the English coastal route. Of course, they can be made only following a suitable consultation process. The Dog Control Orders (Procedures) Regulations 2006 already place additional

I do not believe that local authorities would use the powers to apply dog control orders lightly, so we would prefer to remain with this locally based decision-making process. On the noble Lord&#146;s question about notifications to Natural England, in the time I have had we have not been able to find that information. But, on that, I would be very happy to talk to Natural England and drop him a line about it. He is absolutely right that it would be very helpful for Natural England to have that information, particularly about the coastal access path. We are all clear that local authorities have a very important role to play in the preparatory stages of the coastal access path, so information about dogs is very important for a successful conclusion.</p>

When we talk to groups such as that, we seek to discover the meaning of the amendment so that we can respond as constructively as possible. That was my intention, but if it did not happen quite in that way, I must apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and to the Committee.</p>

I should perhaps put on the record the fact that there are 7.3 million dogs, which are cared for by an estimated 15 million people. Many of us will be aware that the family dog may be thought to be the property of several individuals. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, is in proud possession of one or more dogs and whether they belong only to him or whether his family also takes an interest. That may be the reason for the discrepancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="090421108000181"></a>It has been a helpful and useful debate, not least because we have been able to probe in rather more detail the Government&#146;s long-term intentions. I hope that in so doing we may have given some guidance to stakeholders on all sides of this potential problem on the best way to proceed. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, kindly said that my amendment was a very good first attempt. I have made several attempts, and I will not pretend that the amendment is as good as all that, but given the way in which the Minister responded, it is clearly along the right sort of lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="090421108000182"></a>I in no way deprecate the laying of responsibility on local authorities, but it is right and proper that we should think carefully about the rather mixed experience with local authorities and the way in which they have or have not consulted on the use of dog control orders and how they have imposed them&#151;in some areas on a very large scale, in other areas in a rather more limited way. It will be important for those who want to use a national coastal path, which after all is the objective, that there is some consistency from area to area and that it is compatible with the important needs of livestock husbandry and with the conservation of the environment and wildlife, which is also very important.</p>

There are about three statutes, including the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act, which governs control areas, as well as the CROW Act and what we hope will very soon be the Marine and Coastal Access Act. Thereafter there will be secondary legislation, as has already been made clear, so this is a bit of a minefield for anyone who wants to understand precisely what is involved. However, I understand what the Minister said, and I certainly appreciate the fact that there is a limit to how precise we need to be in the coastal access scheme instruction in the Bill and how far we will get with that.</p>

Those in your Lordships&#146; House who follow the excellent television series &#147;Doc Martin&#148; will have seen the Cornish choughs, which are very carefully protected. They are the most marvellous birds and a symbol of Cornwall, and they featured very strongly in the last episode that I saw. Indeed, it looked as though their nest had been blown up. I have a concern about Cornwall and nesting birds, particularly the Cornish choughs. They should be protected from all forms of disturbance, not least from dogs. It will be a very difficult balancing act, and I wish the Minister well.

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="090421108000188"></a>Amendment A305 changes three to five, suggesting that three years is not long enough to have a sensible review about how this scheme is working. The review would presumably have to start before the end of those three years, which is not going to leave a lot of time for a sensible review. Clearly at some stage a comprehensive and sensible review has to take place. In many ways it will be the outcomes which show whether the scheme is working in the form of stretches of coast open to access through new paths and access land down to the sea which did not exist before. In order to review whether these are working sensibly, you need experience of using the path and the access land. I am not sure that within three years of approval of the scheme there will be a lot of that experience. I will refer to that in a minute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="090421108000189"></a>Amendment A306 suggests that one of the times when a fundamental review has to take place is after the English coastal route has been completed. That will be a significant and iconic moment and I hope we all live to see it. Once it happens, there will have to be a fundamental review of the scheme because then revisions and proposals for amendments will come in and the regime will have changed.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="090421108000190"></a>These amendments are all about the timetable and again I refer to this extremely useful supplementary information from Natural England on coastal access published last December. On page 18, the document sets out the timescale that Natural England would like to see as far as the new coastal access provisions are concerned. Natural England thinks that the legislative process may conclude in 2010 and that it may get formal approval of the scheme in 2010, which obviously is possible although it means everyone has to get their skates on. By 2016, it aims to have an approved alignment for the whole of the English coast. That is ambitious, but it is possible. However, it does not mean that the scheme will have come into effect as far as people using it are concerned. Once the scheme in particular areas has been approved, it has to be put into effect, and that will take some time. It is not a question of a proposal report for a particular section of coast being approved and everyone then being able to go and take advantage. There is going to have to be work on the ground in some areas, and some will require more work than others. In places where there is no access at all, the route will have to be physically created on the ground. That will take time.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="090421108000191"></a>Natural England is suggesting another two years, until 2018, before that can happen, and then it is sensibly putting in two years&#146; contingency for potential delays and rescheduling. If there is to be an appeal or review system, which so far in the Bill there is not, that will inevitably cause more delays. Natural England says that by 2020 it aims to have completed the establishment of the new access and commencement of the new access rights, which requires both the proposal for a particular piece of coast to be approved and any necessary ground work to have been carried out.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="090421108000192"></a>That timetable is not over-pessimistic; indeed, if everything is in place by 2020, everyone will be doing very well. Having the first review of the scheme after three years, when very few new parts of the coast will have been opened up, is premature. It may be possible,

I do not want to slow anything down, but we have to be realistic about what is going to happen and not put a lot of time and effort into reviewing things in a legalistic or bureaucratic way when the effort ought to be put into implementing the scheme on the ground. I beg to move.</p>

I think it is safe to say that we are all in agreement about the importance of a review as soon as possible, in order to assess whether the scheme is functioning and to be able to improve it where it is not.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="090421108000194"></a>The amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, are therefore uncontroversial, in that he appears to be highlighting the need for such a review and the necessity of it being carried out as soon as practicable. We do not wish to have a review too early and so risk assessing the success of the coastal access scheme on inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information. Thus, increasing the time period available to five years, and making sure that a review is carried out when practicable after completion of the route, seems sensible.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="090421108000195"></a>Nevertheless, it is also important to try to carry out a review as soon as possible. That may mean that the scheme has not had time to settle, but it may also be useful for revealing important information. In this way, if there are teething difficulties they can be discovered and dealt with early on, which may reduce problems later. I am therefore cautious about extending my full support to an increase in the number of years before a review has to take place.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="090421108000196"></a>I support Amendment A306, however. It is important that the Bill specifies that if the route takes longer to implement than the period allocated for the first review, a further review must take place after the route is completed. As the Bill stands, a review is required after a specific period of time. It surely makes more sense also to link it to progress of the project that it is supposed to be monitoring.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="090421108000197"></a>Our amendment ensures that regular reviews of the coastal access report must be made. Moreover, by allowing interested parties to request a report it ensures transparency while making certain that problems are addressed. Amendment A357B develops this further and states that a review may be requested because of proposed or actual changes in land use as regards directions under Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the CROW Act for the exclusion or restriction of access. This is important because it means that changes will be properly assessed and scrutinised. Therefore, together our two amendments cover both bases. They allow for both continuous review and also for specific requests by interested parties, if the situation remains the same or if changes occur. This means that it should be possible for all problems to be identified and solutions to be found. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

It is for that reason that I am generally in favour of access to the countryside, which brings billions of pounds every year into the rural economy. This was why foot and mouth was so disastrous. Although it was a tragedy for farmers, it was much more of a tragedy for those people and those businesses dependent upon visitors. It was extraordinary how wide that particular category turned out to be.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="090421108000199"></a>As many of your Lordships know, farming has been through a tough time in the last 10 or 15 years. Every Minister of agriculture, every Secretary of State of Defra, and even myself in a lesser capacity, during those years have been encouraging farmers to look hard at their assets and to see how else they might be able to use them to create an income or, better still, to create employment in the countryside. As ever, the key to a healthy rural economy is diversity, flexibility and continuous response to the market place or even to government signals. Amendment A357B is aimed at catering for this.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="090421108000200"></a>The Government have already virtually accepted this amendment. During our last session when we were discussing possible future port expansion, the Minister indicated that flexibility should be the name of the game and that when, and only when, a development or change of use was being proposed by a landowner, Natural England should look at its route to see what it could do and then change the route to safely accommodate that development. The Minister made the point that this would happen when the development was needed rather than at any time before; in other words, keeping the route flexible.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="090421108000201"></a>I cannot see that there is any difference between a landowner, a developer who is a port authority, a hotelier or any other rural businessman, or even a farmer. Any proposed development will be subject to the planning process which will ensure that the development is appropriate. Owing to the mind-numbingly lengthy process that all planning applications go through, it will also give all parties months or possibly even years to set out sensible alternative solutions. However, the danger here&#151;this is my main point&#151;is that the current, in other words the first, coastal route, could easily be given a sacrosanct status in the minds of the planners, and the proposed development will be forced to accommodate the existing route, along with being forced to accommodate bats and badgers and great-crested newts. What should happen is that the coastal route should be adjusted to accommodate the development. Proposed land-use changes must be looked at with fresh, non-partisan eyes, without any prejudgment. That is why Amendment A357B is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="090421108000203"></a>I shall not be afraid, therefore, to raise a point not about timing but about the scope of Clause 289. A distinction has been made in the debate between the scheme and the route but, in the way that this clause  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1398"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1398</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has been discussed and the issues raised, it seems that the principles, which I suppose are the scheme, and the route, which is the implementation of the scheme, will be the subject of review. My noble friend expressed that as,</p>
<ul><a name="090421108000260"></a>&#147;a review about how this scheme is working&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421108000229"></a>My question is therefore whether the precise distinction between the scheme and the route is correct in the sense in which the review is framed.</p>

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="090421108000204"></a><b><a name="90421-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090421108000402"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> Briefly, I support my noble friend&#146;s Amendment A357B on changes in land use. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, is right that farmers, landowners and others continuously look to develop their land to bring in additional income. I would cite another example. Last week we stayed at the Nare Hotel, near Veryan, which stands on the cliff over a bay. There are immense problems there due to erosion. A path used to go in front of the hotel but it has been closed due to erosion. Another route has been introduced which goes round the back. That sort of action is common sense and presumably there will be no difficulty with it. While staying there we also discussed caravan sites in that area and in others around the country. Presumably the Bill will not mean that rights of way will go through the middle of those&#151;or will they? So far, we have talked about land use in the accepted sense of farming or conservation of wild birds. In the business sense, however, I wonder what the Government&#146;s thinking on this issue is. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, also rightly says that we need to think about planning for the future rather than for an aspect of the past. However, as I highlighted, one pathway which was a right of way could not continue as such because of erosion. Could that affect other development decisions in coastal areas where a coastal path might be considered for access? I support the amendment.</p>

<a name="090421108000205"></a><b><a name="90421-0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="090421108000403"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this interesting debate for the extent to which it has probed how Natural England will review aspects of the scheme. Clause 289 enables Natural England to make any necessary improvements or additions to the approved scheme in the light of experience on the ground following implementation of the new rights.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="090421108000206"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. I note that rather than saying, &#147;What we want, we want it now&#148;, he was going for a longer period than the Government are proposing on review. We suggest within three years. He has taken a somewhat unexpected position but I have listened carefully to what he had to say. However, he must also have taken into account the Select Committee in the other place. It thought that the review ought to take place within one year of establishment work starting on the ground. We are not saying one year. I listened to what the noble Lord has said and I recognise the validity of his points. We need to be able to look at the picture that will develop. However, I assure him that, with Members in the other place taking the view that this could be reassessed very rapidly indeed, if the Government take the position of three years and he takes the position of five years, it looks as though the Government have got it just about right.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1399"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90421-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="090421108000207"></a>I therefore want the noble Lord to consider that important representation from the other place before we finish considering the Bill. It was their view, so he must recognise that, for some, rapid assessment of the position is an important dimension. We take into account all the points that have been made in this debate. We need Natural England to be in a position to learn significant lessons which can be applied in implementing the programme. A review that takes place within three years is both entirely practicable and entirely reasonable.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="090421108000208"></a>Amendment A306 would have the effect of requiring Natural England to undertake a review of the scheme as soon as practicable following the completion of the English coastal route. I categorically assure the Committee that, once the coastal route has been completed, both the Government and Natural England will want to review the scheme and the programme of implementation. Noble Lords are pushing not only at an open door but at a door that is firmly affixed in that position, because we recognise that it will be necessary to look at the scheme at that time. That is why, although I entirely accept the sentiment that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, expressed with regard to Amendment A306, it is unnecessary to put it in the Bill. Any such review will, of course, accord with the principle of sound management within the Government and Natural England. Natural England will in due course report to Parliament on its progress after 10 years. We have therefore placed the necessary obligations on Natural England in the Bill. I give certainty about the review, which is what this amendment seeks.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="090421108000209"></a>I recognise the reasoning behind Amendment A353, which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, tabled. It would place on Natural England a new duty to review a coastal access report at specified times and, in certain circumstances, at the request of a person with a relevant interest in the land. It is unnecessary to add a new requirement on Natural England to review a coastal access report made under Section 51. The problem with such a review is that it might lead to a large number of requests being made to Natural England, placing on it an entirely unfair burden.</p>

<a name="90421-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="090421108000210"></a>That is also the problem with Amendment A357B. After all, it means that any person with a relevant interest in land could trigger a review on certain grounds. I emphasise that, of course, Natural England is already able to review a report if it thinks that it is necessary. Provisions in the 1949 Act and in the Bill envisage that Natural England will do this of its own volition. Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to accept the two amendments. Nor is it appropriate or necessary to involve the Planning Inspectorate. Chapter 2 of the CROW Act contains existing mechanisms for a landowner to apply for new restrictions and exclusions for certain reasons. The existing rights of a landowner in those terms will stay in place for the coastal margin, with certain modifications to take account of the coastal situation.</p>

We will consider further whether there are circumstances in which Natural England should be required to review the proposals. For instance, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, indicated, there might be changes to a route, or it might be blocked because land becomes excepted from the right of access, or other difficulties might arise. I accept entirely the point that she made about those circumstances. I think that was also the burden of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, and of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. We will consider that matter further. The amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, raises a significant point, for which he has received support in several parts of the Committee. I hope that I have convinced the Committee that we have considered these issues. We are not in any way expressing a position in the Bill that greatly diverges from the points made this afternoon except with regard to the three-year period. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, to bear in mind the point that I made on that issue.</p>

However, I beseech him to appreciate the fact that people enjoy walking through land which is flourishing and is having money spent on it to keep it attractive. If a landowner cannot make his place pay, it becomes derelict. Often the fences and the walls will tumble down. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, noted the importance of being able to make a place pay in order to keep it attractive. It is not just a matter of balancing the interests of land managers who want to make a bit of money and the people who want to walk through land and enjoy it. One cannot always freeze land in its existing state and keep it attractive. It is important to have flexibility so that land managers can, if necessary, change what they do with the land in order to keep it attractive. I hope that the noble Lord will take that point on board.</p>

If I sat down before the noble Baroness expressed it, I sat down too quickly. I am very glad that she has done so. It is an important point. We all know that the attractiveness of a coastal path is very much measured in terms of the perspective of the countryside through which it passes and that of the sea. We have all experienced paths that pass through arid environments. I have just been walking in southern Sicily. Despite its mature and significant economy, Sicily is in one of the poorer areas of Europe. We all know about the problems connected with the Sicilian economy. One is all too well aware that dereliction and underinvestment can detract from one&#146;s appreciation of the countryside. I accept the point that the noble Baroness made and I hope she will recognise that we think we have the necessary provisions to guarantee that that point is met.</p>

I am particularly pleased that the Minister has responded to those contributions. The only thing that I will caution him on is the maxim that the Government must be right when they find themselves in the middle of two conflicting points of view. There is a once-great political party, of which neither he nor I is a member, that has made a political living out of being in the middle of the road, to perhaps less effect than if it had been able to stake a position in a more positive way.

That is why it has never been my political position. You might keep out of the gutter, but there is no point if you are then run over. When I look at the political scene nowadays, wherever the Liberal Democrats stand, it is not in the middle of the road, and it is not half way between two right-wing parties. However, I will not pursue that further as we are discussing one of the rare Bills where I am willing to heap quite a lot of praise on the Government for what they are doing and trying to do. I will not be provocative any longer.</p>

However, that is not what the Bill says. It says clearly that at least one review&#151;which I suggest should be the first review, but heavens, perhaps there will be more&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="090421125000004"></a>How long will the review take? Will is be a year? Will it be six months? Certainly it must be completed less than three years after the day on which a scheme is first approved. The question that I asked when I moved the amendment was: do the Government believe that this review should take place in the light of experience on the ground? It seems&#151;this is the point that my noble friend Lady Hamwee made&#151;that it is not a review of a national scheme in a vacuum, but a review of the effects of that scheme as implemented.</p>

I refer again to the very useful coastal access draft scheme that Natural England has published. I have here one of the rare glossy coloured versions. Section 3.1 on page 8 sets out the implementation process. There is a very useful chart entitled, &#147;Overview of the implementation process&#148;. Stage 1 is &#147;Collection and analysis of relevant information&#148;; stage 2 is &#147;Walking the course&#148;; stage 3 is &#147;Draft proposals&#148;; stage 4 is &#147;Consultation on draft proposals&#148;; and stage 5 is &#147;Final report&#148;. That is the report that goes to the Secretary of State. Putting aside any new appeal or review system that might be added to the Bill as it goes through Parliament, there is still the opportunity to make representations, at stage 6. Stage 7 is &#147;Submission to Secretary of State&#148;, and stage 8 is &#147;Preparation and commencement of rights&#148;.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="090421125000006"></a>The final report is dealt with at stage 5. I quote paragraph 3.1.7, because it is important. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="090421125000112"></a>&#147;We estimate that it will take 2 to 2 1/2 years to prepare a final report for submission to the Secretary of State (stages 1 to 7). Following the Secretary of State&#146;s decision, we estimate that it will take a further six to eighteen months for establishment works before the access rights can commence ... These are early estimates which we will test and refine as we develop our operational plan&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421125000007"></a>I suggest that the timetable is likely to stretch if, as seems likely, some rather more comprehensive appeal or review systems and rights are inserted as the Bill goes through Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="090421125000008"></a>That means that if a series of pieces of coastline are chosen for implementation immediately after the scheme is approved, it will be two to two and a half years before any of them get to the Secretary of State and another six to 18 months for establishment works to commence. That means that it will be two and a half to four years from the approval of the national scheme before anything happens on the ground. There is no point in reviewing what has happened on the ground until there is some experience of how it is working, so I would add another year to that. We are then saying that it would be three and a half to five years before anything is worth reviewing and before there is anything on the ground to review that has been in operation for a reasonable period of time; say, 12 months. That brings us to five years.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="090421125000009"></a>Putting in legislation that the review has to be completed within three years is a guarantee that there will be nothing on the ground to look at and to use as experience while that review is taking place and when it is finished. That seems to be the incontrovertible arithmetic of what is written down here. The Government have got it wrong, and they ought to go away and look at it again and go back to what the EFRA Committee in the House of Commons said, which was 12 months after implementation on the ground. If everything speeds up, and the draft forecasts from Natural England turn out to be wrong and it can all be done a lot quicker, if you tie it to implementation on the ground, it does not matter because, however long or short a time it takes, you have a sensible system. At the moment, as it is set out in the Bill, I do not think that it is a sensible system, and I ask the Government to look at this again.</p>

People said that we were barking mad. In moving Amendment A307, I shall speak to Amendments A308 to A312 inclusive. This group is about islands, and partly puts the point that the two large islands, the Isle of Wight and Lundy Island, really ought to be in anyway because it is absolutely clear that they are large enough to have a reasonable coast around them. In the case of Lundy Island, a wonderful place, there is no problem at all about access to the coast. As of now, that takes place through those hardy bands of people who go there on their holidays. The Isle of Wight is slightly more complicated, but has some good coastal walking. They ought to be specified in the Bill, in our view, which is what Amendment A307 does.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="090421125000013"></a>Amendment A308 probes the question of excluded islands, a concept that the Bill sets out in Clause 290(2) and (3). Subsection (2) says that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="090421125000114"></a>&#147;An island is &#147;excluded&#148;&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="090421125000098"></a>and, therefore, not included in the coastal access rights&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000121"></a>&#147;if it is neither ... an accessible island, nor ... an island specified by the Secretary of State by order for the purposes of this paragraph&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1404"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="090421125000099"></a>Amendment A308 probes what that means; what criteria will the Secretary of State use to specify an island? Which islands are likely to be specified and which are not?</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="090421125000014"></a>Amendment A309 addresses a slightly different issue. It would specify that an island will not be excluded if it can be reached by ferry. Amendment A310 does the same thing a different way round, saying that it is accessible if you can,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000122"></a>&#147;travel to it by ferry&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000100"></a>The logic there is that when the coastal path comes to estuaries, ferries are counted as part of it if that is the sensible and appropriate thing there. It is not clear why that should not be the case for islands, so the amendment is to probe that issue.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="090421125000015"></a>Amendment A311 would leave out the word &#147;long-distance&#148; in the part of the Bill that refers to islands being accessible if there could possibly be,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000123"></a>&#147;one or more long-distance routes along its length&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000101"></a>The problem is that those may be quite small islands, where the word &#147;long-distance&#148; is inappropriate. What is &#147;long-distance&#148; in this context? In the context of the 1949 Act, it is defined as a long-distance route&#151;not through a particular length but by definition. If the Cleveland way, the Pennine way and the south-west coastal path are said to be long-distance routes, that is defined under the Act, so that is what it means there. Here, however, I think that &#147;long-distance&#148; is being used differently, to mean a long distance. There will be many islands where people will argue that you cannot have a long-distance walk, unless you go round and round umpteen times, so the word is not appropriate. There may well also be an island where, although its coast is a relatively short distance, however that is defined, it is nevertheless sensible to include it in part of the long-distance coastal route as an optional diversion. The word &#147;long-distance&#148;, then, appears problematic and the purpose of the amendment is to probe that.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="090421125000016"></a>Finally, Amendment A312 is on the same issue about islands; it would leave out &#147;an extensive&#148;, so it is the same as the long-distance point. These amendments are all about islands; some are, quite clearly, insignificant; some ought to be excluded, but some clearly ought to be included. Our purpose here is to find out the Government&#146;s thinking on which ought to be included, and on what basis. I beg to move.</p>

I have to declare an interest, in that Lundy Island is run by the Landmark Trust, which was founded by my late brother-in-law and my sister. That island is hugely attractive, as the noble Lord said, and people love to go there&#151;but they do that because it is as it is. I would have thought the last thing they would want is a path around it. I did not spot this amendment until today, so I have not consulted at all, but I hope that the Government would not accept the suggestion that Lundy Island should be included in the Bill without extensive consultation with the Landmark Trust and the users there, because it seems a thoroughly bad idea. I do not know whether the noble Lord has consulted the Landmark Trust, and do not want to prolong this endless process of looking at the Bill&#146;s detail, but I feel that I must say that.</p>

I find myself in danger of putting myself in the middle of the road, in that I can agree with the principle in the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, but I am not sure if I can fully support these changes in reality. The noble Lord is most concerned that the coastal access route should cover as much of the country as possible. I have much sympathy with that viewpoint; there should be a priority to increase public access to the coast for enjoyment and recreational purposes. Nevertheless, these amendments go a bit too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="090421125000019"></a>Amendment A307 would include the Isle of Wight and Lundy Island under the coastal access scheme. I wonder why the noble Lord feels that to be necessary when, as my noble friend has already said, Lundy Island is owned by the Landmark Trust and is a hub for visitors undertaking many different forms of recreation, while the Isle of Wight has,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000124"></a>&#147;the most concentrated network of public rights of way in the UK&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000102"></a>These islands are set up to actively encourage coastal enjoyment.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="090421125000020"></a>Amendments A309 and A310 are designed to include islands that can also be reached by ferry; Amendments A311 and A312 are drafted to ensure that even very small islands are included. I can see, and sympathise with, the enthusiasm of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, for including every part of England in the coastal access scheme. Nevertheless, it is important to accept that there would be enormous difficulties if the proposals from the noble Lord were accepted. It would mean, for example, considerable further investment and complex work in order to ensure that every island would be safely and securely maintained.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="090421125000021"></a>Furthermore, it would involve increased activity and possible threat to wildlife or livestock on islands on which far fewer people would otherwise have recourse to visit. Moreover, if they did, they could make use of the already extant rights of way, which are often available. The noble Lord has honourable and noble intentions, but his desire to blanket the coastline of every small island in England may result in more damage than is necessary. At the heart of the Bill, we must find a balance. That has been the case in our many debates about sustainable development and now forms the basis of our discussion about coastal access. We want people to have increased access around the English coast, but we do not want that to be taken to such extremes that it causes problems and disrupts communities because paths are created for the sake of having paths. We must take account of the checks and balances and act accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="090421125000022"></a>Amendment A311 raises some interesting questions. Clause 290(2)(b) allows the Secretary of State to specify islands that will be included under the coastal access scheme. Can the Minister tell us more about how about how the process will work, bearing in mind my previous comments, and tell us which islands are under consideration? I look forward to his response.</p>

If the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is taking up a position midway between that of the Government, which mainly concerns the coastal route on the mainland, and that of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, which is to include the islands, he is going to get very wet&#151;more in danger of drowning than of being knocked over.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="090421125000024"></a>My real grievance with the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is that he has taken most of the points I was going to make. I substantially agree with him that islands raise some complex issues. We clearly could not include all islands. Noble Lords will recognise the problems consequent on that, given that some islands are very small. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has focused on Lundy and the Isle of Wight, and I will come to them in a moment.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="090421125000025"></a>I recognise that many people will want the coastal access route to be extended to islands around the English coast, where that is practicable, so that they can enjoy the wonderful scenery and wildlife that the islands provide. Clause 290 defines the English coast for the purposes of this part, and islands that are accessible on foot will be considered part of the English coast&#151;which of course includes Holy Island and other islands that may at certain times be cut off but are nevertheless for part of the time accessible by foot by means of a causeway. Where islands are not accessible by foot, they can be included by an order of the Secretary of State as long as he is satisfied that the coast of the island is long enough to offer a long-distance route enabling the public to make an extensive journey on foot.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="090421125000026"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said about how long counts as extensive. The requirement in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 specifies an extensive journey on foot. That is reasonable given the concept of the coastal path and obviates the necessity for us to consider access to very small islands, on which the concept of significant walking on a coastal path would be almost meaningless. The amendment insists that both the Isle of Wight and Lundy would automatically be included as part of the English coast. My noble friend Lord Hunt responded to a Parliamentary Question earlier this year by saying that we would indeed consider the extent to which they qualified as being accessible under the current provisions of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="090421125000027"></a>The Isle of Wight is not included because it cannot be reached on foot, but of course there are regular, consistent services to the Isle of Wight guaranteed for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Isle of Wight comes into a very specific category. We will look further at that issue; our minds are not closed about it. I just make the obvious point that, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, emphasised, the Isle of Wight has extensive provision for coastal walks already. As the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, access to Lundy guarantees extensive possibilities&#151;virtually the whole of the island can be traversed on foot.</p>

On other islands, access is also governed by what links there are from the mainland. It goes without saying that it is meaningless to talk about opportunity if there is no regular service. That is why we recognise the importance of access by foot or ferry being included in the definition of the English coast. What about those islands which people can access by boat, but which do not have a regular ferry service?</p>

I know that the governance of the Isles of Scilly is unusual and perhaps somewhat anomalous, but I presume that the Government intend to extend similar consultation on and therefore delineation of access to the coast of at least the larger isles in that group.</p>

The larger and smaller islands in that group scarcely fit in any concept of an extensive walk and therefore run counter to the principle behind the Bill. I hear what the noble Lord says. There are particular difficulties with regard to Scilly different from those of the Isle of Wight or Lundy. We accept the broad proposition that the coastal route would be enhanced by taking into account those islands that are accessible&#151;even if an island is accessible only for part of the day by a causeway. We will also look at the question of the two particular islands: the Isle of Wight and Lundy. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, has already explained why Lundy fits into a significant category. It is already in the possession of the Landmark Trust and only a very limited part of Lundy is inaccessible to anyone who wants to walk it once they get there.</p>

She is absolutely right: Lundy scarcely raises an issue about access for walking. As we have already considered in this short debate, it is true that the Isle of Wight also has very extensive access to its coastal areas and therefore might be regarded as not necessarily within the Bill&#146;s framework. However, we will look at that point further in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment. The Government&#146;s case is that the Bill gives the flexibility to treat islands around the English coast appropriately. Obviously, the islands vary in terms of the criteria that they might need to meet. They allow for the coastal route to include islands which are accessible on foot, and other islands will be included after discussion and consultation and consideration of the views of those with a local interest.</p>

However, he will also recognise that there is a vast disparity between the nature of the islands around the English coast and that the Bill has to provide some flexibility and demarcation in that regard.

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="090421125000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that the Isle of Wight did not need to be there. He could apply the same argument to much of the south-west and just miss it out of the Bill. It seems to me that the case for the Isle of Wight is overwhelming. It is a large, free-standing island which by and large possesses the same characteristics as a large part of the English coast and the hinterland of that coast. There is no reason why the Isle of Wight should not be included. I was grateful for what the Minister said about that island.</p>

<a name="90421-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="090421125000036"></a>The answer we need from the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is why it should not be included. The mainland coast is going to be there, whatever its present condition and access provision, so why should the Isle of Wight not be there? Obviously, Lundy Island is a very different place from the Isle of Wight, and the reason why those two islands have been mentioned is that they are the two obvious examples of large, free-standing islands in England&#151;apart from the Scilly Isles, which are referred to in a completely different section of the Bill, for reasons that people say are &#147;all the usual reasons&#148;, which I do not understand. I am told by people who know the Scilly Isles that I do not really want to understand. So there we go. It is too complicated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="090421125000037"></a>I do not want to see every small island included, and that is not what my amendment suggests in any shape or form. What I had hoped was that the Government would give us some idea of the criteria which they will apply. Apart from the Isle of Wight, I do not think that I got a single useful comment from the Minister on that. He was very good at disguising the fact that he was not going to give me an answer to that, and certainly was not going to give me a list of names of islands that might be included. But we will have to live with that for a short time.</p>

You can walk anywhere on Lundy. I have walked around the coast of Lundy, I have climbed on the cliffs, and I have gone down perilous, steep, grassy slopes to the beaches and back again. It is a great, fun place to be, so in a sense it does not need to be included. The real danger of not including places, though, is the old danger that if they are not included, some people will come along and say, &#147;It is not included. Therefore at some future stage we will start to introduce restrictions which are not there at the moment&#148;. That is the argument used by horse riders, for example. It is

My amendments in this group seek to probe how the establishment of a coastal route will be handled when we come to estuaries. We touched on this matter on the previous day in Committee, enough to tell me that, once again, I might be on the opposite side of the argument to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. He is not in his place at the moment, so perhaps we will not hear from him on this issue. But my difference with him on the basic projection of how this path is going to be brought in is a matter of pragmatism. There are notorious difficulties with some areas: islands are one of them and estuaries are another. So the thinking behind these amendments is to acknowledge that difficulty and ensure that problems with estuaries do not hold up the development of the routes as a whole.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="090421125000040"></a>My amendments seek to ensure that Natural England takes special care when designating the routes around estuaries, especially as regards environmental considerations. Estuaries are, of course, where some of the most important and unfortunately fragile wildlife habitats are to be found. As the Bill is drafted, it seems that a right of access will be driven through potentially sensitive areas for the sole aim of joining up two parts of the coastal path. I hope the Minister will be able to assure me that this is not the case.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="090421125000041"></a>It would seem more sensible to put in an aim that the coastal route should not come to an abrupt end in the middle of nowhere. Moreover, given that estuaries are generally either more built up than the coast, or liberally scattered with conservation sites, would it not be more sensible to place the duty on Natural England to find the most convenient right of way at which to end the coastal route? Walkers wanting to continue their journey would then have the opportunity to go on without having to backtrack, but would not be sent through unsuitable ground.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="090421125000042"></a>As regards the wider approach to estuaries, we are pleased to see that Natural England retains some discretion as to whether to continue the route into the

This is again a point where I anticipate we might find ourselves in disagreement with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="090421125000043"></a>Although the continuity of the coastal route is, of course, desirable, it is not, to us, the overwhelming priority. Increasing access to the coast is our priority, and forcing Natural England to spend scarce resources on an estuarial route rather than on a coastal route seems counterproductive. Some estuaries may be relatively easy to incorporate into the coastal route, but many will not. Not only are there the environmental considerations I have spoken of, but there are developments such as ports and marinas, which we have already discussed at considerable length as being unsuitable for the route. We are talking about land which is much more likely to be built on or developed. Unlike other long-distance footpaths, which by definition have been designed to avoid developed areas, as soon as you get into estuaries, there are considerable problems associated with development.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="090421125000044"></a>The primary aim for Natural England should be to establish the quickest and easiest way for walkers to get to the other side of the estuary, back on to coastal land, where they can continue their walk. I beg to move.</p>

When I thought about it, it became clear that it needed to be debated.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="090421125000046"></a>Having read stuff produced by Natural England on how it is going to go about this matter, and having discussed it with the Minister and his team and read a lot of the material, I am a little clearer on what is going to happen but still not completely clear. I apologise for not being present to hear the first part of what the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said, although I understand that he thought that I would disagree with him&#151;but when you have to go, you have to go. However, I heard what he said towards the end and I suspect that, if we looked in a practical way at particular estuaries, we would agree more often than disagree. It is a question of what should be in the legislation and how it should be defined.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="090421125000047"></a>There are two issues about which I am still not at all clear. One is the question of estuarial waters. The relevance of the nature of the waters to a coastal path is not clear to me. It seems that the other issues in this clause concerning whether it looks and feels like coastal land, and the practicalities of it&#151;river crossings and so on&#151;are far more relevant than the nature of the water and whether it is salt or fresh water. I do not know how people walking round the coast are supposed to know about that anyhow. Therefore, I am not sure that that is the right definition.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="090421125000048"></a>If you are going to define an estuary, you should simply draw a line and say that that is where the estuary starts&#151;from a common-sense, geographical point of view. The Thames estuary starts where you can draw a line along the mouth of the estuary. I do not think that that is particularly relevant so long as  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1411"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Natural England has the ability and flexibility to go upstream where that is sensible. That will have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. There are estuaries and estuaries. Where does the Severn estuary start? Does it start at Land&#146;s End? Clearly not, or perhaps it does, but does it matter? The north coast of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset is all clearly coastal. Where does the Severn start and the Bristol Channel finish? It is a matter of opinion, is it not? Therefore, talking about estuarial waters and that kind of thing is irrelevant.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="090421125000049"></a>There is the Severn and the Bristol Channel, but with big estuaries, such as those of the Thames, the Mersey and the Humber, one just has to take common-sense decisions. Then there are lots of little estuaries, particularly on the east coast of Essex, for example. I do not know when an estuary turns into a creek or whatever, but it is all very complicated and I do not think that people are particularly concerned about whether the coastal path goes up and down every little inlet. It would be absurd if it did and I do not think that anyone is arguing that it should. Common-sense views have to be taken in certain places. That seems to be the essence of the matter, and I think that this part of the Bill should be better drafted to say that.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="090421125000050"></a>One document&#151;I could not find it because <I>Hansard</I> had taken it away to copy it&#151;talks about the work schemes which Natural England is getting on with now, one of which is some sort of pilot project to look at how a particular estuary might work. Does the Minister have any information on which estuary it is, how typical it might be and whether we can judge that? I believe that, when they come out, the results of that piece of work will be very important as an indication of how estuaries will be looked at.</p>

<a name="90421-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="090421125000051"></a>The final point is the question of how far upstream the path goes and the ability to go to the first crossing point. There may be some instances where there is a sensible case for taking the coastal path upstream beyond the first crossing point if it leads to a place where the path can sensibly finish&#151;in a village or the edge of a town or whatever. I am not suggesting that the path should go through dockyards or marinas or whatever. Clearly, we all agree that, when things such as that block the coast, the path will either have to stop or go round them. Therefore, no nonsensical ideas are being put forward here. However, the first crossing point may be a ferry, which may be seasonal, as we discussed in a previous session. When is a ferry a ferry? Is it a ferry if it runs in the summer, if it runs two days a week, if it is mechanically propelled or if people are just taken across in a rowing boat every so often? There are real difficulties in defining ferries and I am not sure that the Government have completely sorted it out. It is a difficult subject and it may not be possible to deal with it in the Bill. The definition may have to be left pretty flexible and vague, relying on the sense of Natural England and the processes of appeal and so on. In many cases, there may well be a great deal of sense in saying, &#147;Get on with the rest of the coast and worry about the estuaries at the end&#148;. Therefore, I do not think that there is a huge amount between us. What matters is that we get a system implemented on the ground and that it makes sense in the unique circumstances of each estuary.</p>

As I read Clause 291(7) on page 177 of the Bill, it looks as though there might be a conflict of interest, and I seek clarification on that. It seems to imply that Natural England and the Secretary of State can act against each other. I hope that the Minister tells me that that is not so but I shall be grateful to know what the Government intend in that subsection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="090421125000053"></a>I support my noble friend&#146;s comments about estuaries. In the Joint Committee, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, we had quite a long discussion on the question of where estuaries begin and finish, and whether the first crossing is appropriate. My noble friend highlighted an important point, which I refer to on page 89 of the Joint Committee&#146;s report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="090421125000116"></a>&#147;There will also be sensitive habitats which require either permanent or seasonal restriction of access. The other main interruption to the path will come in the form of commercial businesses and private properties, of which there are many along the coast&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421125000103"></a>The difficulty with this Bill is in trying to find a sensitive way of opening up access in particular areas, especially in estuaries. My amendment is very specific and I should be grateful for clarification.</p>

The point at which I became completely confused in Clause 291 was in trying to read subsection (3)(b) against subsection (4)(f). Subsection (3)(b) deals with &#147;downstream&#148; of the point described in subsection (3)(a). Under subsection (4), Natural England has regard to matters which are listed in taking its decision under subsection (3)(b). Those matters are listed in subsection (4). Paragraph (f) says that it has to consider,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000125"></a>&#147;whether it is desirable to continue the ... route to a particular physical feature&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000104"></a>I read that as being upstream of the point in subsection (3)(a), otherwise there would be no need to mention it. However, subsections (4) and (3)(b) deal with &#147;downstream&#148;. I hope that your Lordships are with me with so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="090421125000055"></a>My difficulty may be, as my noble friend identified, not understanding what is meant by &#147;estuarial waters&#148; within the limits of transitional waters within the directive&#151;that is in the interpretation clause. My goodness, if one has to go round and round in such circles, it certainly argues for trying to cut through this and find the sort of common-sense approach that my noble friend was describing.</p>

They and other noble Lords have very eloquently described some of the challenges relating to the coastal access path and estuaries. Let me make it clear to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that the Government do not want to send walkers through inappropriate areas. The point he made is well taken and I agree with him that there should not be a sense of Natural England being forced down the estuaries, but there are some estuaries where  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1413"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it makes sense and is appropriate for the path to follow some part of the estuary. The suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was that there might be a case for flexibility regarding estuaries, because of the different natures of many estuaries and some of the challenges involved. I think he is right and that is why we prefer the wording of the Bill. I assure noble Lords that in making provision for estuaries in the Bill, we do not want to overcomplicate matters; we do not want Natural England to have to spend enormous time worrying about estuaries at the expense of the coastal path. I hope that it helps noble Lords when I make that very clear from this Dispatch Box.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="090421125000059"></a>In general, Clause 291 gives Natural England the flexibility to propose the establishment of the route up estuaries to the first pedestrian crossing point. It makes it clear that Natural England can decide not to extend the route at any point between the mouth of the river&#151;the seaward limit of the estuarial waters, where the fresh water of a river mixes with the salt water of the open sea&#151;and the first crossing point. In such cases, there would a break in the continuity of the route. We recognise that estuaries throw up particular challenges&#151;they are very variable in extent, they are very important for wildlife and they may be more developed, as noble Lords have said, than the open coast. We think it important that Natural England should have the flexibility to decide on the approach to estuaries on a case-by-case basis. I think that that is the common-sense approach that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, suggests, but I am interested in his views on the wording&#151;whether there is enough flexibility&#151;and I will give them some consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="090421125000060"></a>In deciding whether to make a recommendation to stop the route at any point between the mouth of the river and the first crossing point, Natural England must have regard to both the general considerations in Clause 287 and the additional matters in Clause 291(4), which include, among others, the nature of the land, the topography of the shoreline, the width of the river upstream to the first crossing point and the existence of a ferry by which the public may cross the river.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="090421125000062"></a>This definition is used in Clause 291, which refers to estuarial waters for the purpose of describing where the route may be established beside an estuary. I understand entirely what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, meant when he asked about the relevance of the definition of estuarial waters. We needed a convenient method to specify the outer parameter for considering estuaries. As he says, what an estuary is is a matter of opinion, but we needed an outer limit to act as a starting point; it is no more than a starting point. Natural England can then consult and discuss what a common-sense approach to an estuary is. We think we have sufficient flexibility, but with a clearly defined point from which Natural England can start.</p>

It has nothing to do with people walking around the coast, and has been decided upon and agreed for completely different purposes. When you have big estuaries, you have to make common-sense decisions, but the Minister referred to &#147;the mouth of the river&#148; and in most cases, most people looking at the mouth of a river would say, &#147;That is the mouth of the river&#148;. Why do the Government not talk about &#147;the mouth of the river&#148; rather than about the chemical composition of the water at any particular place?</p>

Surely it is important for Natural England to have a definition which is understood and which it can start from. We have the flexibility, but Natural England does not have to use that. We have the provision for it to go up the estuary, but that is the main reason for any use. I realise that one is always open to criticism when one reads a technical definition out, but at least there is clarity and that is important.</p>

I do not have details about where they are being undertaken, but I shall find out and let noble Lords know, certainly in time for Report. On the question of sensitive habitats raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, I understand the point well. Restrictions and exclusions of access may be applied on estuaries, as on other parts of the coastal route, and they may be applied for reasons of natural conservation. We all know that many estuaries are places of outstanding importance to the environment and to wildlife. Of course, it is important that those are protected and that will be a consideration that Natural England will have to pay attention to.</p>

Having listened to his argument, I have no difficulties in accepting the principle behind this amendment, which would mean that Natural England must not decide to continue the route up to the first crossing point solely on the basis of the desirability of the continuity of the route. The criteria in this clause were tailored to be applied in the case that Natural England might propose that the coastal route should

I will take this point and look at it again with a view to bringing forward an amendment on Report that makes the considerations listed in Clause 291(4) apply to all decisions about estuaries. In that sense, I hope that that greater flexibility also meets the very sensible common-sense test that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has put forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="090421125000067"></a>Amendment A318A would add a further matter on the existence of environmental designations to the list of considerations in Clause 291(4) and require Natural England to explain in its coastal access report how the recreational benefits, set out in subsection (4)(d), outweigh any of the other matters. I understand what the noble Lord is saying, but I do not think that it is needed. Natural England will be under a duty to strike a fair balance, which we have discussed before, and will need to consider that balance as part of its report. It will undertake a detailed analysis on each estuary. It has already set out in its draft scheme information on the special considerations it will take into account in making a recommendation on any particular estuary.

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="090421125000068"></a>The point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, in her Amendment A319A is interesting and I can understand why it has been put forward. The substance of the argument is that we believe it is important for the Secretary of State to be able to come to a different conclusion to Natural England about decisions on estuaries. But the provision in the Bill is worded in the way that it is because we want to avoid any suggestion that the Secretary of State&#146;s decision is pre-empted by the combination of subsection (5) and Natural England&#146;s decision under subsections (2) and (3). I readily accept that it is a rather complicated way of doing so, but the essence is that the coastal access duty of the Secretary of State is independent from that of Natural England. The Secretary of State must be able to come to a separate decision on that, in the same way as he can disagree with Natural England&#146;s proposals in a coastal access report. However, I accept that the way in which it has been drafted is complicated, so I understand why the noble Baroness has proposed her amendment.</p>

These amendments are about what happens when erosion occurs along the coast. In moving Amendment A326, I shall speak also to Amendments A328A, A329, A330 and A358DA in this group. Amendment A326 would clarify the circumstances under which the report into the proposals for a particular piece of coast would find it necessary to identify coast which was going to retreat and to identify alternative retreat lines in the likelihood of coastal erosion. At the moment, the Bill states that

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="090421125000076"></a>The draft scheme put forward by Natural England suggests that 20 years could be the appropriate length of time. This is a probing amendment to determine what the Bill means and what sort of timescale would be thought to be appropriate. Clearly, at some stage a report for a particular part of the coast could be amended by means of a review. If a coast was likely to erode back to the line of the route within, say, 50 years, it would not have to be dealt with immediately. What timescale are the Government thinking of for it to be dealt with in the report?</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="090421125000077"></a>Amendment A328A is a consequential amendment. Amendment A329 has been tabled to probe the meaning of the words,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000127"></a>&#147;geomorphological processes in relation to which the Agency has functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000105"></a>New Section 55B(6), to be inserted in the 1949 Act, will state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="090421125000118"></a>&#147;Natural England must consult the Environment Agency before exercising its powers&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="090421125000106"></a>in respect of sub-paragraph (a), which makes provision in respect of rollback when there is erosion. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="090421125000119"></a>&#147;Natural England must consult the Environment Agency ... in respect of an area which is or may be ... subject to significant coastal erosion or encroachment by the sea&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="090421125000107"></a>which is sensible and understandable,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000128"></a>&#147;or ... subject to significant physical change due to other geomorphological processes in relation to which the Agency has functions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000108"></a>I do not understand what that means. Geomorphological processes by and large are the processes of weathering, erosion and deposition. I do not know what other processes there are that might be covered by the suggestion that the Environment Agency has functions in relation to them. I am, however, glad to see that the word &#147;geomorphological&#148; is being used in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="090421125000078"></a>Amendment A330 would insert,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000129"></a>&#147;subject to significant physical change as a result of actions by the Agency or other public body&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000109"></a>At the moment rollback, as I understand it, refers to natural processes of natural erosion and other geomorphological<b></b>processes. There might be circumstances in which there must be rollback because of actions by the Environment Agency or any other public body. An obvious example is part of the east coast of England being flooded as part of protecting the land against rising sea levels&#151;land that has been reclaimed in the past and which is now being sent back to the sea&#151;which might result in having to put the line of the route in a different place if the flooding was not planned or making provision for the line of the route to change if the coast is flooded later.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="090421125000079"></a>Finally, Amendment A358DA in a sense goes back to the question of what happens to rollback when the line of the route is along a public right of way and not on newly created access land. We discussed this in our debate on higher rights such as horse-riding and the  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1418"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1418</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fact that if they are along a right of way, the rollback provisions will not protect the right of way but will create new access land: or will they? What exactly will happen if the line of the coastal route is along an existing right of way&#151;a footpath or a bridleway&#151;and rollback provisions are thought to be necessary? Will those rollback provisions be put in regardless but relate to access land as opposed to a right of way? How will that work? This is a complicated matter, and I am not sure that it has been completely thought through. If it has been completely thought through, it has not been explained to me in a way that I yet understand properly. I beg to move.</p>

In our brief discussions on an earlier amendment, I gave the example of the Nare Hotel in Cornwall and erosion that had affected the pathway. By local agreement, it has now been put behind the hotel. I refer again to that sort of subject.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="090421125000081"></a>I suggest that we remove new Section 55B(4) in Clause 292 in order to have a discussion about the whole question of rollback. I know the east coast quite well. Just up from Southwold is Covehythe. Below it is Dunwich, which is now in the sea; there is very little left. Covehythe has lost nearly three miles of coastland. The question is therefore what happens to a pathway when it is realigned? Is there a risk that it could be put through a farmyard, farm business park or private estate? What comeback would the owner of that property, who may well not have been the owner of the original pathway that is now no more and is in the sea, have when the pathway is redesignated?</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="090421125000082"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, is no longer in his place, but quite a few areas along the north Norfolk coast&#151;Suffolk and Essex have been mentioned before&#151;face a considerable threat of new erosion. If there is to be a recognised path for people to walk on, what will happen when so much of it is no longer in being and the new path is likely to go across another owner&#146;s land in place of the traditional path that had been agreed in the past? That is the reasoning behind my amendment, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="090421125000084"></a>The Bill allows alternative routes to be proposed that can be used during specified periods, in place of exclusions from Chapter II in Part I of the CROW Act, or for reasons of flooding, erosion or geomorphological processes. It also allows Natural England, when an area is subject to erosion or physical damage, to set out proposals for any part of the route to be changed in accordance with these proposals. On one hand this seems sensible; there will obviously be physical changes to the route, as flooding, erosion or exclusions under the CROW Act will mean that access to the ordinary route is blocked or impossible. We do not want walkers scrabbling around the edge of a cliff trying to stick to the original path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="090421125000085"></a>Nevertheless, some equilibrium has to be found. Amendment A326A, in the name of my noble friend Lady Byford, flags up the issue that, under the Bill, the route can be determined by reference to the edge of a cliff or the boundary of a field. Will the Minister inform the Committee whether there will be any restraints on the changes that can be made? Does he agree that a sensible balance must be maintained, or does he argue that landowners should be expected to watch as the path creeps further and further into their land or farmyard?</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="090421125000086"></a>On a tangential point, new Section 55B(6) requires Natural England to consult the Environment Agency under certain conditions. Will the Minister say whether, before changes to the route are made under this part of the Bill, Natural England will,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000130"></a>&#147;consult such persons as it considers appropriate&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="090421125000110"></a>as per Clause 288(5)? Before changes are made, will Natural England consult all interested parties, particularly the occupier of the land, on those changes?</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="090421125000087"></a>I declare my support for Amendment A326 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. This amendment would usefully clarify a timeframe for assessing whether an area &#147;may&#148; be subject to erosion &#147;within the next ten years&#148;. Does the Minister agree that this is a useful definition? Surely without this timeframe, it could be argued that any area is subject to the possibility of erosion or physical change at some unspecified time in the future.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="090421125000088"></a>Amendments A329 and A330, which are also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, also seem sensible, as they would guarantee that Natural England had to consult the Environment Agency before making changes to the route, even if the geomorphological pressures causing the change had nothing to do with the Environment Agency itself. Does the Minister agree that it is important that the Environment Agency is included in the consultation process, bearing in mind that my consultation process would include all interested parties, including occupiers of the land? I will be interested to hear his response.</p>

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="090421134000001"></a><b><a name="90421-0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090421125000171"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> This has been an interesting debate. Clause 292 inserts new sections into Part IV of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. New Section 55B provides for the coastal route to roll back where the cliff is subject to significant erosion or other forms of coastal change and says that in relevant areas, the route may be identified according to the proposals made in Natural England&#146;s report, for example, by proximity to a cliff edge or in relation to a field boundary.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="090421125000090"></a>Amendment A326, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would have the effect of applying this section where the change is likely to occur within the next 10 years. It is clear that Natural England will have to give detailed consideration to such areas, but there is a problem in setting a time limit. Without being a scientist, it is perfectly possible to see that a section of coastal pathway is subject to significant erosion, but it is generally more difficult to determine when the erosion may take place. Is it one year, 10, 20 or 50 years? While I understand exactly where the noble Lord is coming from, that is why we are rather resistant to putting a time limit into primary legislation. It would fetter the flexibility of Natural England in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="090421125000091"></a>Amendments A328A, A329 and A330 deal with matters where an area is or may be subject to significant coastal erosion or encroachment by the sea, or to any significant physical change due to other geomorphological processes in relation to which the Environment Agency has functions. The amendments would remove the reference to the agency&#146;s functions where the agency must be consulted. Let me make it clear that if the agency has no relevant functions, it would be unable to give any advice as a statutory body. If the amendments were accepted, Natural England would also have to consult with regard to physical change as a result of actions by public bodies.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="090421125000092"></a>The relevant functions of the Environment Agency that we have in mind are these. The agency has specific functions in relation to flood risk and flood defence management, which are relevant to new Section 55B(6)(a) and set out in the Water Resources Act 1991 and the Environment Act 1995. In relation to new Section 55B(6)(b) the functions referred to are those in the Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2003, the Water Resources Act 1991 and the water framework directive itself. The agency, as the flood risk management authority, needs to be aware of areas on the coastal access route which are at risk of encroachment by the sea and from coastal erosion. As the competent authority for the water framework directive, it needs to be aware of risks to surface water and ground water bodies from physical change due to other geomorphological processes. That is why it is relevant that the Environment Agency should have functions and must be consulted.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="090421125000093"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, asked about consultation and a review of the route. The normal process for consultation is by proposals made in Natural England&#146;s report. Consultations take place on a variation of the proposals just as they would for the initial route. I hope therefore that I can reassure him on the general point about consultation.</p>

<a name="90421-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="090421125000094"></a>New Section 55B deals with the rollback mechanism, which is appropriate for natural changes that cannot be predicted. The management of coastal erosion, flood defences and actions taken by public bodies in relation to these will be very important factors which Natural England will have to take into account when designating the route. In some cases, Natural England may indicate that the route will be reviewed when planned management measures take place. I can reassure noble Lords that the Environment Agency will be a key player in all this, and the Bill already requires Natural England in new Section 55D to consult the agency before preparing a report in relation to any interests in flood defence, in the management of the effects of coastal erosion, or in encroachment by the sea. It must also consult the agency before giving a direction for a temporary diversion in certain circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="090421125000095"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, spoke to Amendment A326A which she described as probing in nature. I ought to say that subsection (4) provides clarity to subsection (2) by saying that Natural England may describe the route by reference to a cliff edge or a field boundary,</p>
<ul><a name="090421125000131"></a>&#147;as that cliff edge or field boundary exists from time to time&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="090421125000111"></a>This means that as the cliff or field boundary changes over time, so does the route. That is why we think it is a useful definition. But the point she made is that the path can roll back ever further, with the risk that it ends up going through developed land. I refer the noble Baroness to the draft scheme from Natural England, particularly to section 4.9 which gives a lot of useful examples. There will be check-up points where the path runs up to developed land. It will then stop rolling back and be routed behind the developed land. We understand the point raised by the noble Baroness, but there is enough flexibility in the way the scheme is to be taken forward, although clearly we are talking about a draft version that we have had the benefit of seeing. I will make sure that my officials pass on the contents of this debate to ensure that in the final scheme, which will have to be laid before Parliament, we have made sure that the matter has been taken into account.</p>

As he knows, along the coastlines particularly of Norfolk and north Suffolk, caravan parks and holiday chalets are sited right up to the cliff edge. At the moment, the footpath does not necessarily pass in front of these structures, although in some cases it may do so. If there is a rollback, will the newly designed path still go behind the caravans, thus benefiting those using them as holiday homes or even just as visitors, or will the route itself take precedence over what for many is very much a commercial entity which could be affected if the route is a public path?</p>

I have already referred to section 4.9 of the draft scheme, which I believe gives sufficient flexibility. However, one of the issues presumably for the owners of caravan sites is that if it is perceived that there is a risk of erosion and rollback might embrace the caravan site, one must ponder the viability of the site as a whole. I think that we have the right provisions in place to take a common-sense approach to this, and I will certainly make sure that these matters are considered as we take forward the actual scheme. Rollback is sensible because it allows for flexibility, but it can also come up against viable commercial operations. We have to make sure that this works for everybody as much as we can, and I think we have the flexibility to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="090421134000002"></a>Amendment A358DA, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, raised the question of the relationship between CROW and rights of way. It is a very important point. Although his amendment would ultimately mean that the route could not follow an existing right of way, it is a probing amendment, so he is not actually seeking that. It is intended to use existing public rights of way, where appropriate. My understanding is that he is asking what happens to rollback where the route is along a right of way. The route will roll back and then access will be provided under the CROW right of access. I have an extensive

Would he be happy for me to write to him on it? It is an important point and there are situations where you have a right of way but the margin outwith the right of way is covered by CROW, so it is as complex area. I am happy to circulate a full note on the matter.</p>

It is complicated and I still do not quite understand how it will work. If there is a right of way and no access land, because it is not appropriate for there to be any marginal land, how does the coastal margin associated with it then roll back? It is a technical question and there will be parts of the coast where that happens. I am reminded by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that there are plenty of places where there is a right of way along a cliff top which has long since disappeared and roll back has occurred in an informal way. The edge of the field has rolled back because the farmer does not want to drive his tractor over the cliff edge and the right of way is through empty air. You cannot use it, but there is still a coastal path there.</p>

All the amendments in this group deal with alternative routes where, for different reasons, the usual route is not usable or is banned from being used and there has to be an alternative route provided, which in most cases will obviously be further inland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="090421134000007"></a>Amendment A331 deals with proposed new Section 55C, which is about alternative routes. Subsection (2) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="090421134000146"></a>&#147;The report may include, in relation to the route (&#145;the ordinary route&#146;) or any part of it, a proposal under subsection (3) or (4)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421134000130"></a>This is a proposal for an alternative route which is to operate as a diversion. Amendment A331 says that, where there is a blockage of the route for whatever reason, there has to be an alternative route. The Bill says that it &#147;may&#148; include proposals for an alternative route. The amendment says that that must be the case where appropriate. It may be semantics or it may be an important point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="090421134000008"></a>Amendment A333 probes the question of proposals for an alternative route under proposed new Section 55C(3),</p>
<ul><a name="090421134000163"></a>&#147;which is to operate as a diversion from the ordinary route, or part of it, during one or both of the following&#151;</ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="090421134000147"></a>(a) any specified period (or periods), and</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="090421134000148"></a>(b) any period during which access to the ordinary route ... is excluded by reason of a direction under Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the CROW Act (exclusion or restriction of access)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421134000131"></a>The second part of that is fairly clear and obvious but the first part is not. &#147;Any specified period or periods&#148; is a very general and vague phrase. The purpose of the amendment is to probe what it means. It is linked to Amendment A336, which takes out subsection (5), again for the purpose of probing it to understand what it means. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="090421134000149"></a>&#147;In subsection 3(a) &#145;specified&#146; means&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="090421134000150"></a>(a)specified in, or determined in accordance with, the proposal, or</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="090421134000151"></a>(b) determined in accordance with the proposal by&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="090421134000152"></a>(i) a person specified in a proposal or</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="090421134000153"></a>(ii) a person determined in accordance with the proposal, details of whom are notified to Natural England in accordance with the proposal&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421134000132"></a>This is getting very close to being legislative gobbledegook. It took me a very long time to understand it, and I am not sure that I do now. The basic question underlying all this is: what kind of circumstances may apply where subsection (3)(a) closures may be brought into effect?</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="090421134000009"></a>Amendment A334 is intended specifically to bring in the question of ferries and to require an alternative route to be provided when ferries are not operating. At the moment the coastal path can be defined as including a journey by ferry. It specifically says it is a journey on foot, except where there is a ferry. As we have discussed, there are seasonal ferries, ferries which operate once or twice a day, ferries which operate every half hour, ferries which do not operate on Sundays, et cetera. This amendment would require an alternative route to be provided if the journey was blocked because a ferry was not operating for any substantial or reasonable period of time.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="090421134000010"></a>Amendment A335 is about the provisions in proposed new Section 55C(4), which are optional alternatives. The subsection states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="090421134000154"></a>&#147;(4) A proposal under this subsection is a proposal for an alternative route which is to operate as an optional alternative to the ordinary route, or part, during any period for which the ordinary route, or part, might reasonably be regarded as unsuitable for use by reason of&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="090421134000155"></a>(a) flooding,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="090421134000156"></a>(b) the action of the tide,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="090421134000157"></a>(c) coastal erosion or encroachment by the sea, or</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="090421134000158"></a>(d) the effect of any other geomorphological process&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421134000133"></a>I am glad to see that geomorphology appears again.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="090421134000011"></a>This is to probe what is meant by,</p>
<ul><a name="090421134000164"></a>&#147;optional alternative to the ordinary route&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421134000134"></a>Are there optional alternatives at any time? Is there an alternative for people who do not want to go across land which might be liable to be flooded, even if it was not the flooding season, or for people who do not want to be caught by the tide, even if it is low tide and they could get across?</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1424"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1424</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90421-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="090421134000012"></a>What is an optional alternative? Is it an option that exists all the time, or does it exist only when either flooding is taking place, the tide is in or it is a particularly high tide, or there is coastal erosion or encroachment by the sea&#151;I am not sure that coastal erosion should be here; that should be a permanent alternative, but never mind&#151;or the effect of any other geomorphological process? I am not sure what such a process might be; I suppose it might be a landslide, if the route goes below cliffs that are liable to that kind of process. Is it a permanent option that exists all the time and the person walking along the coast decides whether or not to exercise it, or is the option decided by someone else who says, &#147;Ey up, the tide&#146;s in. Let&#146;s put a sign up sending people around a different way&#148;? This is quite important. In practice, if there is an optional route, it ought to be there all the time and people can then exercise their judgment about whether to go along the potentially dangerous route or to take the safe one. I beg to move.</p>

I agree with Amendment A331 of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves; it is important for the sake of clarity and transparency that proposals for changes under subsections (3) and (4) are included in the report. Further amendments make the alternative routes much more flexible, both by removing the definition of &#147;specified periods&#148; and by allowing the alternative route to be a generic optional route, not subject to use in conditions of, for example, flooding or coastal erosion.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="090421134000014"></a>Proposed new Section 55C(4) lists reasons for unsuitability for use of the ordinary route:</p>
<ul><a name="090421134000165"></a>&#147;flooding ... the action of the tide ... coastal erosion or encroachment by the sea ... the effect of any other geomorphological process&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421134000135"></a>I know that the Minister hates lists, but here he has one. He hates them because people add to them, and I am not going to disappoint him here. There are other appropriate reasons why one may need a different route, such as the nesting season. Maybe you do not want people walking through a site then. In Norfolk, for instance, where I come from, nesting sites for terns are cordoned off so that people cannot go through them during that season.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="090421134000015"></a>Another reason might be that there is a military live-firing range. I do not know what the proposals are for ranges by the sea. It may be that, when the military are not using them, the coast next to the seashore can be used. And then, of course, there is shooting. What plans does the Minister have to ensure that the public are well informed when alternative routes must be used?</p>

Like him, I had a problem with the term &#147;optional&#148;. I can see that it would be an &#147;option&#148; not to get your feet wet, but is it really a sensible option to fall into the void created by erosion? The clause seems to be dealing with very different circumstances but describing the remedy in the same way, which is not entirely appropriate.</p>

In general, the clause is a useful addition; it provides some flexibility for the circumstances described in this part of the Bill. It is an example of how the Bill seeks to anticipate circumstances that might arise and not then cause a halt to the coastal route, so as a general point this is a sensible proposal.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="090421134000018"></a>Noble Lords have raised a number of interesting questions and examples. They question whether the Bill as it is drafted really meets those circumstances, and I will look at these matters between Committee and Report to ensure that I am satisfied that it does. A number of interesting points have been made here.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="090421134000019"></a>Amendment A331 would change the wording so that instead of saying that Natural England may provide for an alternative route, it would say that Natural England must, where appropriate, include such a proposal. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, suggested that he might be being somewhat overprescriptive, and I think he is. The important point is that Natural England has the ability to propose alternative routes where it considers that it is appropriate to do so, which is implied by the use of the word &#147;may&#148;.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="090421134000020"></a>I realise that if the noble Lord had proposed &#147;must&#148; and not &#147;where appropriate&#148;, my argument against him would be stronger; if that were the case, Natural England would have to consider on every stretch of the route whether an alternative route was appropriate and where it should go. By the use of the phrase &#147;where appropriate&#148; he has qualified the use of the word &#147;must&#148;, but on the other hand I have no reason to think that the use of the word &#147;may&#148; would inhibit Natural England from taking a sensible and proportionate approach to this.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="090421134000021"></a>We then have a series of amendments, A333 to A336, the effect of which would be that an alternative route could be provided only when an exclusion or restriction of access under Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 was in force or in an estuary when a ferry was not working. My problem with that is that the amendments would essentially remove Natural England&#146;s ability to specify any other period during which an alternative route may operate and remove the four situations that are listed in the Bill where an optional alternative route might be put in place when a route is unsuitable for use&#151;for instance, for flooding, the action of the tide, coastal erosion or encroachment of the sea or the effect of any other geomorphological process.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="090421134000022"></a>The noble Lord posed the question: if an alternative route is prescribed, what are the options for people to use it? That is not how we see it; we see the alternative route being used only when the particular conditions set out in subsection (4)(a) to (d) apply. However, the person exercising their right can also exercise their judgment about whether those conditions apply. I am not suggesting that we are going to have notices up and down the country saying at which moment an alternative route may apply or not. We have to have some flexibility with regard to that.</p>

<a name="90421-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="090421134000023"></a>There are other issues listed in this clause that noble Lords have raised. On the question of the Ministry of Defence, MoD ranges are usually military by-lawed  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1426"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1426</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>land, a category of excepted land, so the route would not go through MoD sites in the first place. He then raised the point that they might be using the firing range only at certain times of the year. The MoD might provide permissive access if the ranges are not in use and can be made safe for the public. It is probably best to leave it to the discretion of the MoD rather than use the provisions here. This provides a useful flexibility. I have no reason to believe that Natural England will not use it sensibly. That is why I would like to retain the word &#147;may&#148;. It has been an interesting debate and between now and Report I will look at some of the instances noble Lords have raised to make sure that they are covered by the current wording.</p>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="090421134000024"></a><b><a name="90421-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090421134000196"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Will the Minister consider further the question I raised about the specified period or periods and this extraordinarily convoluted new Section 55C(5) which says what &#147;specified&#148; means. Perhaps he could write and explain this to us. I am not particularly concerned about knowing exactly what it means in a grammatical sense as it seems to mean people specified or appointed in lots of different ways. I am interested to know, however, what kind of things it refers to. I was not trying to take it out but probing what kind of circumstances are in the minds of the people who wrote this legislation, of the Minister, of Natural England or of anybody else who was involved in it. It is not clear and I cannot think of any sensible circumstances, but that may be because I do not understand it. Can the Minister set out some circumstances in which it might be used?</p>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="090421134000025"></a><b><a name="90421-0010.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="090421134000197"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I will do my best. If you look at the wording of new Section 55C&#151;I know it has its moments, I accept that&#151;the critical part is new subsection (4), which sets out the conditions in which the ordinary route or path might be regarded as unsuitable. There may be circumstances in which the unsuitability relates to a period of time. New Section 55C(3) is needed to allow Natural England to use that specification. That would be my answer to the noble Lord, but I am happy to dig deep to give some examples if we can find them.</p>

<a name="090421134000026"></a><b><a name="90421-0010.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090421134000198"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I should also have said that I am grateful to the Minister for saying he would look at the totality of this debate and the points that have been raised. The Minister has now raised the interesting question as to whether new subsection (3) and new subsection (4) may operate together because new subsection (5) refers only to new subsection (3) and not to new subsection (4). That also relates to a question that the Minister may want to look at and write to us about. Why is the wording of new subsection (3) different from the wording of new subsection (4)? New subsection (3) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="090421134000166"></a>&#147;an alternative route which is to operate as a diversion from the ordinary route&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90421-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="090421134000027"></a>I understand that as it goes on to talk about a diversion for particular periods. There would have to be notices and regulations and so on. Then new subsection (4) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="090421134000167"></a>&#147;an alternative route which is to operate as an optional alternative to the ordinary route&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="090421134000028"></a>Again, I do not think the Minister has answered the question whether it will be an option at any time. If it is not supposed to be an option at any time, how will it be policed? There does not seem to be any sense to having rules which say you can come along this path, which may well become a well-trodden and clear path, but you are not supposed to go there if instead you can go along the beach if the tide is not in. If it is an optional path surely it should be an optional path at all times, otherwise it does not make sense. I do not think it can be policed. If it cannot even be informally policed by peer pressure there is no sense in it.</p>

This may be where some of the confusion and certainly my confusion arises.</p>

My noble friend was right to touch on the breeding season but it could be the burning of heather or any other reason. I had assumed that that applied to new subsection (3) and the definition applied to new subsection (4) but if I am not right I should like to have it clarified.</p>

Noble Lords have raised other circumstances. I thought I had answered the question in relation to MoD land where I said it would be treated as excepted land but the MoD might then decide to open up firing ranges if it was appropriate and safe to do so. Other examples have been given such as the question of nesting. These matters will be dealt with as the plans for the coastal path are developed. That may be a factor in deciding where the route goes in the first place. I have said, however, that I will look at these examples to make sure that we are covered in relation to alternative routes.</p>

New subsection (3) relates to the circumstances under new subsection (4) where it is appropriate that there is a diversion and the diversion may operate at specified periods. On the question of whether the alternative route should always be specified as being available at the same time as the main route, I think that is too inflexible. Surely there has to be flexibility. I can see that there might be circumstances where there would be no problem at all about the alternative route also being used but there might be circumstances where that was not appropriate. I understand that there is also the issue of policing. We need to be pragmatic. This is a sensible provision which we want to work in a flexible way but, as I have said, I will look into this matter and make sure that we are covered for the circumstances noble Lords have raised.</p>

He is now saying that proposed new subsection (3) qualifies proposed new subsection (4). That is not how I had read or understood them; they refer to different circumstances. Proposed new subsection (3) is not a means of qualifying proposed new subsection (4). This needs looking at again.</p>

It is very important indeed that the schemes are put together in a clear, open, transparent and consultative way, that representations are properly considered in a clear, open and transparent way, and that, as far as possible, the proposals for each section of the coast

My amendment would insert a new Section 55DA into the 1949 Act, which would put a duty on the Secretary of State to issue regulations setting that process out. I have incorporated those proposals that are already in the Bill, to make it clearer, more comprehensive and much more satisfactory&#151;to make it absolutely certain that what needs to be done is done.</p>

Unitary authorities and metropolitan boroughs also adjacent to the coast should really be listed there.

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="090421134000045"></a>During the passage of this Bill, the Government have made their views on lists pretty clear. However, in Part 9 of the Bill it is important that we update the list included in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, but that does not mean that we should extend it to include all the organisations which might need to be consulted. We need to retain some degree of flexibility. The noble Lord&#146;s proposal, about which he is quite frank, is to put his list in the Bill. However, we should not be including consultees for definitive maps on rights of way in this legislation. It is entirely different from the 1949 legislation.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="090421134000046"></a>Amendment A341 would insert a new section setting out a number of requirements on Natural England at the stage of their consultation during the preparation of their coastal access report. The amendment is too prescriptive and goes too far. The process for consultation in new Section 55D was drawn up to reflect what is already in Section 51 of the 1949 Act, and that places sufficient requirements on Natural England to consult appropriately. Indeed, Natural England&#146;s scheme, published in December 2008 and which we have made available to noble Lords, already builds in such a draft report stage. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was generous enough to say that he thought that Natural England would probably do what he was prescribing. He is right, but he wants it in the Bill and I am not convinced that that degree of prescription is necessary.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="090421134000047"></a>Natural England has already said that it will publish its draft proposals on the internet. It will invite all relevant interests to comment on them. It will allow a 12-week period for people to view the proposals and submit comments on the report. Natural England is fulfilling the spirit of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, but his amendment would put in the Bill a prescription that is a step too far because of its rigidity and the limitations that it puts on Natural England, which will work very much along the lines that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has suggested. I hope, therefore, that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

We are debating this evening the draft Categories of Gaming Machine (Amendment) Regulations 2009. These regulations are intended to increase the stake and prize limits for all category C gaming machines, and for only specified types of category D machines.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="090421134000053"></a>Last year the Government received numerous representations in support of seaside arcades, which were struggling under difficult trading conditions. As noble Lords will be aware, the economic climate has not improved and many businesses continue to struggle. For example, arcade revenue is down by 21 per cent, with over 170 reported closures since July 2007, resulting in nearly 1,000 jobs lost. Manufacturing output of gaming machines is down 55 per cent since 2005, with nearly 300 jobs lost since 2007. Seaside arcades offer soft gambling environments. They are not permitted to offer higher prize gaming machines, and they form  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1432"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an integral part of many families&#146; holidays. It is for these reasons the Government wish to see them prosper and continue.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="090421134000054"></a>That is why, on 25 June 2008, the Government announced that to examine the case for providing economic assistance to seaside arcades, as well as pubs and clubs, they would bring forward a review of stake and prize limits in respect of low-prize category C and D machines. Following an initial consultation exercise, the Government were persuaded that a modest increase in stake and prize levels was appropriate. They remain confident that such an increase will not risk the licensing objectives in the Gambling Act, which are rightly cast in terms of protecting children and vulnerable adults from being harmed or exploited by gambling.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="090421134000055"></a>I turn first to category C gaming machines. The maximum stake for a category C machine is currently set at 50 pence, with the maximum prize set at &#163;35. These regulations will increase the stake limit to &#163;1 and the prize limit to &#163;70. Noble Lords will know that the Government consulted publicly on a number of options last August, with the preferred option being to increase the stake limit to 60 pence and the prize limit to &#163;60, compared to the proposal of &#163;1 and &#163;70. It was felt at the time that a 100 per cent increase in stake and prize levels might be difficult to reconcile with the precautionary approach already taken to the implementation of the Gambling Act 2005 as a whole.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="090421134000056"></a>The Government were concerned that prize levels of &#163;70 or more might take category C gaming machines in the direction of harder gaming machines, unless accompanied by additional restrictions on game speed and features. They did not want to see the important distinctions between harder and softer gaming machines eroded. However, responses to the consultation made it clear that 60 pence and &#163;60 limits would not have the necessary benefit for the operators of seaside arcades or machine manufacturers in the way that was hoped or judged to be needed. It was unlikely, in particular, that such limits would generate adequate new business for machine manufacturers and suppliers. Market research showed that moving away from the present stake-to-prize ratio of 1:70 would deter players. That meant that as well as being unattractive to players, the limits would be too low to provide incentives for manufacturers to develop new machines and for operators to replace legacy machines. Therefore, after discussions with a number of trade associations, the Government accepted that limits of &#163;1 and &#163;70 for category C machines would be more practical and economically beneficial to operators and manufacturers.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="090421134000057"></a>The availability of higher prize category C machines is more likely to encourage operators to replace their legacy machines with new machines. This will help to invigorate the manufacturing market, which I described earlier as having a challenging time. It will also enable manufacturers to provide a range of appealing games as an alternative to the higher prize, harder gambling, category B machines. By not alienating players who might be interested in multi-stake and multi-prize machines, a &#163;1 stake to &#163;70 prize limit offers a real incentive to operators of soft gambling environments, such as seaside arcades, to refrain from splitting existing premises to gain a higher proportion of category B machines.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="090421134000058"></a>The Government also took into account advice from the Gambling Commission that, in the wider context of problem gambling, changes of up to &#163;1 in stake would not pose a significant threat to the licensing objectives, provided appropriate controls on machine standards were put in place. The Gambling Commission is doing just that and the Government are confident that these revised standards will help to allay any concerns raised during the consultations.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="090421134000059"></a>I turn now to category D machines. These regulations do not affect money prize machines&#151;that is, the lowest prize category of fruit machines. Instead, they are intended to increase the stake and prize limits for so-called crane-grabs and coin-pusher machines, also known in the trade as penny falls. These types of machine are a much present element of seaside arcades, and playing them also forms an enjoyable part of many families&#146; weekend and holiday activities.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="090421134000060"></a></p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="090421134000061"></a>At present, coin-pusher machines have a maximum stake limit of 10p and a maximum total prize of &#163;8, of which &#163;5 can be cash and up to the value of &#163;3 can be non-cash. This has enabled operators of such games to include small non-cash prizes to vary the offer and the attractiveness of these machines. During the first public consultation there were no representations in relation to coin-pusher machines that warranted any change to the Government&#146;s original view. They remain satisfied that any increase will not jeopardise the licensing objectives. Therefore, under these regulations the maximum stake for coin-pusher machines will remain at 10p, while the maximum prize will increase to &#163;15, of which &#163;8 can be a money prize.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="090421134000062"></a>For crane-grab machines, the maximum stake is currently set at 30p, with the maximum prize value set at &#163;8. These regulations will increase the stake limit to &#163;1 and the prize limit to &#163;50. Back in August the Government originally consulted on a revised limit of 50p and &#163;30 for this type of machine. The primary reason for this was caution, given the appeal of these machines to children. However, following the consultation, it became clear that these proposals, while not endangering the licensing objectives, would not provide the benefit to seaside arcades that had been hoped. After discussions with a number of trade associations, the Government accepted that stake and prize limits higher than those initially proposed would enable operators to offer more attractive prize items such as PlayStation and Xbox games, mobile phones and iPod Shuffles. As a parent, I know that we must, however reluctantly at times, accept that tastes for prizes have grown more sophisticated over the past decade or so. By allowing seaside arcades to offer such prizes, these regulations will go a long way to help them to address the difficult economic position in which they find themselves and to keep themselves commercially attractive. That is why it was felt that on balance that &#163;1 and &#163;50 limits would be more appropriate. The Government are reassured that this increase, when considered within the overall context of the regulatory regime, will not undermine the licensing objectives. Also, raising the limit of crane grabs to &#163;1 will not be a price increase in the conventional sense. Rather, operators will continue to offer a range of stakes and prizes, from a 10p stake and a &#163;1 prize upwards, with the average

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="090421134000063"></a>I know that some here this evening will have concerns about the stake and prize limits for category C and category D gaming machines being increased at all and, indeed, to these levels. I would like to comment on those concerns as they have featured largely in our decision-making. It is appropriate to reiterate that protection of children and the vulnerable from the potential harm of problem gambling remains central to the Government&#146;s approach to gambling and gambling regulation. That is why the decision was made to consult again on the revised proposals in December last year and to conduct that consultation clearly and over time to a degree for which we have been criticised for not concluding in advance of the Easter season.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="090421134000064"></a>The Government felt it important that all stakeholders who might be concerned about the risks to problem gambling should have another opportunity to voice their opinions. In particular, representatives from the faith groups were invited to a meeting during the consultation period so that their concerns could be heard and understood at first-hand. The Government took those views into account when deciding on the current proposals. Increasing the stake and prize limits for low-prize gaming machines does not represent a relaxation of the regulatory regime, nor should these proposals be viewed in isolation. Instead, they must be considered within the context of the regulatory regime put in place by the Gambling Act 2005.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="090421134000065"></a>All categories of gaming machines must comply with strict regulations and equally strict technical standards. To ensure that the distinction between category C and higher category B gaming machines does not become blurred, the Gambling Commission is proposing to amend the technical standards in respect of speed of play and linked games for category C gaming machines. Revised standards to this effect were notified to the European Commission on 10 March. Indeed, the Government sought the advice of the Gambling Commission early on in this process. It is its view that, in the wider context of problem gambling, changes in stake limits of up to &#163;1 will not pose a significant threat to the licensing objectives provided that appropriate controls are put in place. Also, through operating licences the Gambling Commission licenses and regulates all those who manufacture, supply, install, maintain, adapt or repair gaming machines. In addition, further protections for consumers are secured through the Gambling Commission&#146;s licence conditions and code of practice, which include specific provision in relation to underage gambling and problem gambling through requirements in respect of supervision, access, staff training and self-exclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="090421134000066"></a>Noble Lords will know that some stakeholders, including faith groups, have been critical of these proposals. They are concerned that the Government appear to be endorsing ever higher levels of gambling when economic conditions mean people might have less money to spend. That is not the case. The Government have listened to the case made by the gambling industry but they have also taken on board the concerns that

Stakes and prizes form only a small part of the overall regulatory and protection regime created by the Gambling Act and these proposals, when considered within their overall context, do not jeopardise the licensing objectives. To ensure that this remains the case, the Government will, of course, monitor the implementation of these regulations.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="090421134000067"></a>It is important to reiterate that, for the majority of people, gambling in this form is an entertaining and entertainment pastime that presents not problems but rather enjoyment and reward. These regulations are designed to ensure that operators at the softer end of the gambling industry, particularly seaside arcades but also pubs and clubs, are able to manage in difficult trading conditions and increasingly competitive markets, but only in so far as the licensing objectives are preserved. It should be made clear that continually increasing stake and prize levels is not the only answer to the pressures faced by operators and manufacturers. The industry must explore&#151;and, indeed, is exploring&#151;other ways to freshen its appeal.</p>

<a name="90421-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="090421134000068"></a>That said, the Government are in a position to provide some limited help. They recognise that there is a need to protect jobs and to support a challenged industry in unprecedentedly difficult times. However, there is also an obligation on them to ensure that vulnerable people, particularly children, are protected from the potential harm that excessive gambling can cause. The licensing objectives are therefore non-negotiable. Stake and prize levels for category C and certain types of category D machines are being increased to assist the industry, but only because the Government are satisfied that the licensing objectives will not be prejudiced by so doing. Noble Lords can be assured that the Government have not been cavalier with the concerns raised by faith groups and other stakeholders during this process. They have been listened to and their concerns have been considered and taken into account. Overall, the Government are satisfied that the proposed changes will give the industry the lift it genuinely needs without undermining the precautionary principle adopted throughout the implementation of the 2005 Act. It is for these reasons that I commend these regulations to the House.</p>

They have said that they will consult on category B machines but, to help the industry, that should already have been done. The Government are avoiding the much bigger challenges we face in the UK gambling market. Not least, they should be looking at the use of fixed-odds betting terminals. Have they appreciated that FOBTs provide a much more dangerous form of gambling? Indeed, the particular dangers of these terminals has inspired their nickname of the crack cocaine of gambling.

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="090421134000073"></a>We are talking about making a series of small changes at the softer end of gambling, which is being hit hard. We are talking about making category C machines more profitable, by giving people an inducement to invest in them by making them more fun to play. I remember a conversation a good few years ago with a friend in a pub who was pumping money into a machine. I said, &#147;You didn&#146;t get anything back&#148;. He said, &#147;Yes, but I had a good game&#148;. The attraction was the element of chance, and playing the nudge backwards and forwards. I appreciate that the Minister is trying to make a high enough profit margin for these machines to keep them interesting and keep them used. They are also used to subsidise things like pubs and other forms of club activity.</p>

I am afraid that they will get splinters either way&#151;on what part of their anatomy is down to the skill of the Minister in question. Let us just say that there is no right answer here, merely the best one that you can make at the time.</p>

There were several references to putting appropriate controls in place. I am not clear what those are and whether they would work.

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="090421134000078"></a>I am completely at a loss to know why we pass laws that seem to encourage the gaming industry to expand&#151;and I believe that this legislation does that. We have also had battles over the Manchester supercasino, which certainly did that. Why do we encourage this? We know that gambling and gaming so easily become addictive, and that they harm both individuals and society. That is why a coalition of faith bodies is opposed to this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="090421134000079"></a>The Minister spoke eloquently about listening to these groups, but it does not seem that their concerns have really been taken into account. There is evidence from Canada, Australia and New Zealand that at least one-third of the profits of gaming come from at-risk or problem gamblers. That is not entertainment. The Minister argued that there would be no significant increase through these proposals; that remains to be seen. I believe that they will increase problem gambling in a time of recession, and vulnerable people will be most affected. The 2007 gambling prevalence study showed that those on lower incomes have higher rates of problem gambling. We have a duty, as the Minister said, towards the vulnerable and towards children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="090421134000080"></a>There has already been a threefold increase in stakes since 1997. The increase proposed is neither proportionate nor modest; it is well above the rate of inflation. The argument that children can access these machines because stakes and prizes are low, which was put in 2005, will no longer be the case. Children are being sacrificed to the demands of seaside arcades. Children will be able to accept prizes worth &#163;50 and &#163;70. These are getting close to hard gambling numbers, as the Minister said.</p>

<a name="90421-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="090421134000081"></a>It was promised in 2005 that there would be research into whether higher stakes and prizes led to an increase in problem gambling. None has been forthcoming. There was a promise from Tessa Jowell that there would be no further liberalisation until proper research was done. Recently, the Gambling Commission released a study that confirmed the strong relationship between problem gambling&#151;including slot-machine gambling&#151;and high alcohol consumption. Could we have research into how many alcohol-related deaths are also linked to gaming and gambling?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="090421134000082"></a>It is a laudable aim to seek to stem the decline of our seaside towns. However, the way to do this is to encourage healthy activities for families. Playing fruit machines and gaming machines are largely individual pursuits, not things that families enjoy doing together. A similar argument applies to pubs. We want the English pub to thrive, but the income that landlords make from gaming machines is tiny compared with the annual turnover. Increasing stakes and prizes will not save pubs. What will save them are high-quality meals, social activities like quizzes and enough space in our overworked lives to go out and enjoy ourselves&#151;because we live in a culture of overwork.</p>

This is not a relaxation in any way, shape or form of the regulatory regime. The regulations, as I said in my opening remarks, need to be considered in the context of the whole regime. The increases are being enacted via secondary legislation. Although I was not involved in the debate at the time&#151;I was an observer&#151;I think that the Government were referring to those aspects that were debated in Parliament through the Bill, which is the overarching regulatory regime. I was reassured to hear that the right reverend Prelate has participated in penny-falls and crane-grabs, not least because I am a parent. It would be inappropriate for a government Minister to make an observation on the odds of that crane actually ever bringing anything to the point where it gets dropped into the waiting hands of the paying customer.

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="090421134000097"></a>For what it is worth, I am not a gambler, at least not in the financial sense of that word, but I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Golding, that gambling is an entertainment activity that for many millions of people is a very legitimate form of controlled and balanced entertainment and satisfaction. It is entirely appropriate for this House to speak up for that vibrant and thriving industry.</p>

<a name="90421-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="090421134000098"></a>It is clear that the arcade operators need to find a route to competition. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, was making that point about the real attractiveness of those operations. Clearly, we need to get the balance right between the arcade operators and what might be called the harder gambling environments. We do not believe for a second that this provision answers all of those problems, but it will contribute to the industry&#146;s ability to reinvent itself and make it competitive.</p>

I feel comfortable that the Government are in the right place on those issues.</p>

<a name="90421-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="090421134000100"></a>Overall, gambling is a delicate area but not a difficult one. We need to get the balance right and these are small changes for a particular area of commercial activity. We do not for a second believe that this will reinvigorate the English seaside resort. However, as a regular attendee of UK seaside resorts, I think that it would be fair to point to the improvements made over the past 12 to 15 years in water quality and the bathing environment, in the quality of meals in pubs and in the opportunity for people to enjoy that holiday environment&#151;not to mention the competitiveness of sterling, which is making UK resorts ever more attractive. This small measure will, we hope, allow our seaside arcades to make themselves more attractive, more competitive and more commercially viable.</p>

My first two amendments probe the consultation with those with a relevant interest in the land. We have talked about the definition of that. Given the rather tighter definition of relevant interest that the Government insist on in the Bill, as opposed to the CROW Act, the number of consultees will not necessarily be as high. I should like some assurances that Natural England will do all that it can to seek out the views of those who are not large landowners or are not plugged into national or even local organisations so that they are involved in the development of the legislation. They may not even know about the development of this route and will certainly not know that they need to keep an eye out for what is proposed by Natural England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="090421134000103"></a>National and local organisations will also be important. The briefings that Peers on all sides have received from some of them show how useful they can be in identifying the concerns of both potential users and those who will be affected. To ignore them would be a big mistake. My third amendment would ensure that they, too, are consulted properly during the preparatory stages. I beg to move.</p>

In page 179, line 42, it would leave out paragraph (e). It is a probing amendment. My noble friend talked earlier about the whole question of the MoD and MoD land and the possibility of access land. The reason for my amendment is to ask the Minister how Natural England will know what available land falls within the national security category. It is also linked with new Section 55D(6)(b). Will Natural England be able to explain any exclusions or restrictions resulting from defence or national security considerations? If not, what price openness and transparency? Between the two provisions, it seems that any military land that may be used or opened up for access could in the first instance not to be known to Natural England. I suspect that it would be known to local authorities, but it does not say that in the Bill; it just refers to Natural England and the Secretary of State. That is the reason for my first amendment.</p>

<a name="90421-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="090421134000105"></a>My name is linked to the second amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, which concerns Statutory Instrument 1993/12. The list in that statutory instrument works well at present. It is simple; it is well known to everybody; it has 10 people to consult in all. They are: the Auto Cycle Union, the British Horse Society, the Byways and Bridleways Trust, the Open Spaces Society, the Ramblers&#146; Association, the British Driving Society, the Cyclist Touring Club, the Peak and Northern Footpaths Society, the Chiltern Society and the Welsh Trail Riders Association. It seems odd, if something is working well, that it will not be included. I am happy to support that amendment as well.</p>

We have had some discussion about these issues on the previous amendments. There is a requirement on Natural England to consult various relevant bodies before drawing up the report, in addition to the persons already included in Section 51(4) of the 1949 Act, which include the national park authority, joint planning board, county council and county district through whose park or area the route may pass. So I would be surprised, as I think the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, perhaps partially conceded, if people were not aware of the issue of the coastal path&#151;certainly as far as these representative organisations are concerned. I do not see how Natural England could be in any position other than being fully appraised of local considerations in those matters. We have the key local bodies listed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="090421134000107"></a>The problem with Amendments A337A and A338, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is that, rather than having to take reasonable steps to consult and notify persons with a relevant interest in affected land, Natural England would be required to consult all such persons in preparing its report. Now who are these persons? We do not have, in England, a land register, so we might be imposing on Natural England a task which is actually an impossible burden. If we say &#147;all&#148; in the legislation&#151;all land interests&#151;then the body would be open to challenge if it failed in any respect with regard to a part of the coastal path. That is not just an onerous task: it is a burden which Natural England could not accept and carry out, even in the best possible faith, because of the problem of

What we will do is provide regulations requiring Natural England to give those with a relevant interest an opportunity to make representations on its report once it has prepared one. That is certainly our intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090421134000108"></a>Amendments A338ZA and A340, along with Amendment A339, proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, the noble Lord, Lord Dear, and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, seek to insert other bodies into the list, including charities and organisations set out in Schedule 6 to the Wildlife and Countryside (Definitive Maps and Statements) Regulations 1993. Amendment A338A would remove the requirement to consult the Secretary of State on defence and national security interests. I do not think we could accept that proposition. The MoD owns quite a lot of land which is close to the coast, and surely it is right and appropriate for Natural England to consult the ministry when drawing up its report. There are significant problems with that land, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, identified. I am thinking of the Dorset position, for example. Those are the issues that apply with regard to restrictions. We would obviously expect the Secretary of State for Defence to be consulted about these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090421134000109"></a>The organisations listed in Schedule 6 will have an opportunity to make representations on the report when it is completed but I do not think that we could require Natural England to consult them at the initial stage. If Natural England considers that such bodies have particular knowledge or that they can make a particular input at the initial stage, I am sure it will recognise that it is in its interests to consult them. However, that is different from making the issues mandatory in the Bill. I am not seeking to decry the significance of these organisations, nor am I saying that the likelihood is that their interests will be ignored. However, there is a difference between Natural England seeking to consult them about the report, when published, and being obliged to do so in the Bill at the initial stage.</p>

<a name="90421-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090421134000110"></a>I recognise the significance of anyone with an interest in land, and I very much appreciate the argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. However, we cannot put an obligation on Natural England which it cannot be guaranteed to fulfil, and I do not consider that it would be able to meet the requirement suggested in the amendment.</p>

<a name="90421-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090421134000111"></a>I turn to the consultation list to which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred and the list that she read out. These bodies can make their issues known to Natural England during consultation, but she will recognise that that list is derived from legislation which sought to achieve other, although related, objectives. There is nothing to stop these bodies making their views known to Natural England, as they will no doubt do, and there is nothing to stop them making representations, which will be summarised by Natural England and put before the Secretary of State. However, that is a little different from translating a list of organisations from one piece of legislation where they were listed because of the nature of that legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="090421134000112"></a>Natural England has been working with Defence Estates on issues of appropriate access. In the concept of this coastal path, questions must be asked of landowners and the Ministry of Defence is significant in that respect. It is right that questions are asked about access which may, in the view of noble Lords, have been particularly restrictive in the past, although I have no doubt that my colleagues at the Ministry of Defence would emphasise the extent to which they have sought to minimise restrictions on the public. Natural England has been working with Defence Estates to clarify the question of defence land being available for the coastal path as far as possible. There may just be circumstances where it is not possible, but Natural England is already considering that matter because we recognise the strength of the noble Baroness&#146;s case.</p>

It is clearly a practical problem: some of the information is very sensitive and obviously should not be in the public domain. However, if there is to be a coastal route, surely people will ask why it does or does not go across particular areas, and that is why I raised that.</p>

<a name="90421-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="090421134000114"></a>On the other issue, the trouble is that, once you have a list of those whom Natural England must consult, it becomes clear that there are those who are not included. Indeed, the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, to which my name is added, clearly reflects that they are not included. I accept that this is always a difficult matter but I gather that there are only 10 people in all. It would have been a fairly simple task, involving, I believe, about seven letters, but it would have been worth doing. I heard what the Minister said but it is on the first point that I am sensitive to the difficulties that the Government face. Clearly, it does not matter if some of this information is in the public domain but with some of it, it obviously does.</p>

To some extent I can understand his reluctance to see a requirement in the Bill, but planning law and compulsory purchase law are full of obligations on public bodies to make contact with people who are affected, even if it is putting notices on telegraph poles to make them aware of what is going on. The principle behind my amendments is that it is important that we involve all the parties at the earliest possible stage. Getting people involved makes it so much easier and avoids differences of opinion after the event. It is far better to have the advice, help, assistance and guidance of interested parties at the earliest stage. I note what the Minister says and I am particularly interested in what he had to say about defence land. There are other

In moving Amendment A342, I shall speak also to many more in this group, which also contains a government amendment and various Conservative amendments. This is really about who is consulted when Natural England produces what I think it calls a &#147;final report&#148; for a particular piece of coast, after it has done all its work, and presented its proposals to the Secretary of State. The amendments in this group amount to the mother of all lists. Amendment A342, however, is slightly different. The Bill says that the Secretary of State &#147;may&#148; make regulations in relation to the consultation processes. We are saying that the Secretary of State &#147;shall&#148; make regulations in relation to the consultation processes. No doubt these regulations are going to be made and therefore there is no reason why the regulation should not describe what &#147;shall&#148; happen and not what &#147;may&#148; happen. Amendment A343A is the first of a number of amendments that add to the list of organisations and persons who, when a report is sent to the Secretary of State, have to be consulted and given the opportunity to make representations to Natural England and then on to the Secretary of State. This is an important group. Amendment A343A refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="090421134000171"></a>&#147;any other principal local authority whose area includes the whole or part of the area to which the report relates ... a parish council or parish meeting&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="090421134000118"></a>This provision is important not just because these elected local bodies ought to be consulted, informed about what has happened and given the opportunity to make representations. Principal local authorities, whether they are counties, districts, unitaries or anything else, and parish councils are, in their own right, recreation and leisure authorities. Not to consult them on a major recreation and leisure facility being proposed in their area would be wrong. Many of them are also planning authorities and, again, not to consult them on a major change in land use in their area would be wrong. So they should be included. However many others should or should not be included, principal local authorities and parish councils should be&#151;not just access authorities which have direct responsibility for access provision.</p>

<p><a name="090421134000143"></a>concerns flexibility, not the rigidity of which we were accused as regards the last amendment before the dinner break. Amendment A349B refers to &#147;any resident&#148;. Clearly, residents do not have to be written to individually, but there are plenty of ways to advertise so that residents know what is going on. Amendment A349C refers to,</p>

I simply want to make one point and, in doing so, I should emphasise that in an honorary capacity I have the privilege of being a vice-president of the Campaign for National Parks and a president of the Friends of the Lake District, which represents CPRE in the whole of Cumbria. If we are going to ensure that those organisations, which have been so well listed in Amendment A346, are consulted, these two bodies really ought to be included, whatever has or has not been the case in existing legislation. Both of them do sterling work in the interests of preserving the countryside and making it accessible to the public, and both are based on a range of locally based societies that draw together people in the community who have a sense of responsibility towards these areas. Both show a great deal of imagination in carrying forward the work day after day throughout the year, and I argue simply that if there is to be a list&#151;there is a great deal to be said for having a list of this kind&#151;it would be odd if these two organisations were not included.</p>

To the extent that they do so, they probe how far the Government intend the consultations to go. As I suggested in our debate on the amendments dealing with consulting those with a relevant interest, merely putting up a notice in a local authority office and expecting people to know how to check it might not be sufficient. Similarly, I cannot imagine a circumstance in which it would not be appropriate for the Secretary of State to publish his determination in a way that brings it to people&#146;s attention.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="090421134000124"></a>Amendment A351D, like Amendment A352 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, again suggests that relevant charities and organisations should be considered to have a relevant interest. In general, it seems sensible to take as many views from as many relevant people as possible. As we have said, charities and similar organisations could have valuable knowledge of problems that might arise.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="090421134000125"></a>The number of amendments tabled that would add various bodies to the list in new Section 55E(2) shows the Committee&#146;s concern that this list is not exclusionary. I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that representations will be read from anyone who might be interested. If a representation is clearly spurious or irrelevant, Natural England just needs to note that in its response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="090421134000127"></a>I shall deal first with Amendment A342 and the question of whether the Secretary of State has the discretion to make such regulations. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that the Secretary of State has every intention of making such regulations and for those regulations to be in place before the process of implementing the route begins. It is a &#147;may/must&#148;, &#147;shall/will&#148; argument. There is no problem with the use of &#147;may&#148;, but I hope that I have given the necessary assurance from the Dispatch Box on that matter.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="090421134000128"></a>I will come to Amendments A343A, A344 to A346, A349 and A349A in a moment. Amendment A352 would add charities or organisations to the list of relevant interested bodies that must be notified of the Secretary of State&#146;s determinations under new Section 55E(6). Amendment A358 would add a definition of a charity. Amendment A347, in the name of my noble friend Lord Judd, would add two organisations to the list of those to be consulted before the report is drawn up.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="090421134000129"></a>As a general statement of intent, the provisions in the Bill are designed to provide a procedure that ensures that Natural England will consult a range of local interests before preparing a report on any proposed coastal route. The list of those who can make representations to Natural England on the coastal access report is limited to those who have a particular interest or role to play in the context of the area that will be affected. We have not listed non-governmental organisations as statutory consultees in any area of the Bill. Such lists quickly become out of date as the bodies to be consulted change over time, and amending primary legislation is not straightforward, as we all know. Moreover, there is always the problem that a list can be perceived as exclusive and capable of setting some stakeholders higher than others in influence.

The Bill provides for regulations to be made specifying how its draft report is to be published and the manner in which representations may be made.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="090421139000001"></a>On Amendment A346, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and the listing of bodies, those bodies are set out in a number of regulations made under the CROW Act but are not listed in the Act itself. It is worth pointing out the bodies that must be consulted by Natural England before it prepares its report for the Secretary of State. I refer to Section 51(4) of the 1949 Act, which makes it clear that before preparing a report, Natural England must consult every national park authority, joint planning board and county district council through whose park or area the route passes. In addition, new Section 55D(4) requires Natural England to take a number of steps and to consult a number of bodies. That, I think, meets noble Lords&#146; requirements for wide consultation.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="090421139000002"></a>I understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about parish councils, but the point is that they have no direct responsibilities for access. However, although they are not listed, they will have an opportunity to comment if they wish. Indeed, that reflects the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, about people and organisations which may not be listed anywhere but nevertheless still have a legitimate right to make representations. I would have thought that parish councils fall within that category.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="090421139000003"></a>Amendment A350ZZA would require a provision that regulations may be made that include a requirement that representations should be made on the question of whether Natural England&#146;s report fulfils the requirements of its coastal access duty in Sections 286 and 287. The Secretary of State will make a determination of Natural England&#146;s report, and the fulfilment of these duties will be the principal issue that he has to consider.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="090421139000004"></a>Amendment A350B would require the Secretary of State to notify persons with a relevant interest in affected land of his determination of Natural England&#146;s report. I want to assure the noble Lord that the Secretary of State will do all he can to notify such persons. I understand and accept the point he raises, but it is unrealistic to expect him to notify everyone, and in certain circumstances it may be impossible to trace the owner of the land and thus fulfil his duty. However, we will ensure that every effort is made.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="090421139000005"></a>Amendments A351A to A351C propose changes to the way in which the Secretary of State might publish his determination. I believe that the current provisions provide some flexibility for the Secretary of State and, in the circumstances, are appropriate. Any charity would already be notified if it was the owner of affected land, and I do not consider a change such as that proposed in A351D to be required. However, I understand that the point of these amendments is to ensure that the consultation process is as wide as possible; that Natural England takes account of all the views expressed; and that it makes every effort to engage with consultees and establish communications with persons with relevant interests. I understand that

I can assure noble Lords that the sentiment behind these amendments will be drawn to Natural England&#146;s attention. As I said, the Secretary of State, in making a determination on these duties, will have regard to the question of whether representations have been made and the way in which Natural England has dealt with them.</p>

However, I draw his attention to one point. He emphasised that under existing arrangements, the national park authorities should be consulted. My point was that the Campaign for National Parks, made up of voluntary bodies throughout the country, each one based in the area of a particular national park, and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, with its locally based activities, are not the same as the statutory body. They are much more akin to the organisations listed by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, in his amendment. I simply ask my noble friend, if he is looking at how this might be covered in regulations, to take my point.</p>

It is so long ago, I cannot remember when it was. The conference room at Defra was full. I do not know if the Scouts or similar organisations were present, but they have a perfectly legitimate interest in these matters. When they make representations or respond to consultation documents, I am sure they will be listened to carefully. We are always reluctant to have lists, particularly in primary legislation, because they set in stone an organisation which may no longer be relevant in the future. We simply need more flexibility. That is the reason for the Government&#146;s response, not because I do not think organisations like the Scouts have a perfectly sensible and important view to express.</p>

I have an old-fashioned view that it does matter because at some point the people running these things may not be quite as nice as they are now, or they may change their intentions.

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="090421139000012"></a>I accept that some of the lists that I have proposed may not be appropriate in primary legislation. We had this argument nine years ago on CROW, when we were promised that, although the lists were not appropriate in primary legislation, they would be put in secondary legislation. Therefore, I do not understand why the Government are resisting doing that in this case, as this is simply an extension of CROW. I ask the Government to think about what kind of secondary legislation, which is much easier to change when organisations change, they would consider under this Bill as well as under CROW.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="090421139000013"></a>I was interested in what the Minister said about local authorities. I will follow his references to the 1949 legislation and check whether what he is saying is right. If it is right, that is fine as far as principal authorities are concerned, but I am sorry that he is resisting having something in the Bill about parish councils. Perhaps the 1949 Act should be amended to include parish councils. I think that what he quoted from the 1949 Act was about long-distance routes generally and not just about the coastal route, so the reference might not be appropriate in this Bill. I am not sure how we should deal with that.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="090421139000014"></a>Parish councils have responsibilities in relation to rights of way, although I accept that the coastal route will not all be a right of way. Parish councils are, however, recreation and leisure authorities and often provide local amenities, so they will be able to make a real contribution to the new coastal route. For example, they may provide and run such local facilities as public lavatories and car parks. They also all have notice boards and might make a contribution in that way. If parish councils are brought in as what people nowadays call partners, they will have in many areas something important and significant to contribute at a local level. They ought to be consultees right from the start. However, I will think again about where we should refer to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="090421139000015"></a>I hope that the Government will not resist this. I have got used to batting on behalf of parish councils on CLG legislation and I find that, whenever I do, I am knocking at an open door. I hope that the door might also be open as far as Defra is concerned. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This group of amendments is about the right of appeal, or the non-right of appeal. The House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded in July 2008:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="090421139000050"></a>&#147;The lack of a formal appeal process is a fundamental weakness of the Bill. As it stands, Defra and Natural England have control of the whole process from policy development to implementation on the ground. Neither organisation has provided us with a convincing explanation why there cannot be a proper third-party appeal process as well as a requirement for consultation with landowners and occupiers. We consider the right of landowners and occupiers to have an independent, third-party appeal process to be an important element of the fair balance between public and private interests that the Government is aiming to achieve. The Bill should provide for such a process&#148;.</p>

<a name="90421-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="090421139000017"></a>The pre-legislative scrutiny Joint Committee on the draft marine Bill reached a similar conclusion in its July 2008 report. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="090421139000051"></a>&#147;The Bill contains no mechanism for appeal against decisions by the Secretary of State to designate land as coastal margin. The ... appeals mechanism&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="090421139000047"></a>under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 regarding mapping of open country and registered common land to which the public have access,</p>
<ul><a name="090421139000053"></a>&#147;will not apply as there is no mapping process and Defra has confirmed that the Secretary of State intends to use powers in the Bill to disapply the CROW appeals mechanism for exclusions and restrictions. Under the draft Bill, the Secretary of State may by regulation make provision for interested persons or organisations &#145;to be given an opportunity to make representations to Natural England about matters which relate to coastal access reports and are of a kind specified in the regulations&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90421-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="090421139000018"></a>Evidence from the Country Land and Business Association and the National Farmers&#146; Union strongly argues for the need for an independent appeals mechanism. Other witnesses supported the need for an independent appeals mechanism as exists in CROW and other access legislation, such as the Highways Act 1980. The only legal redress for dissatisfied owners and occupiers in the absence of such an appeals mechanism will be judicial review. The representations process in the Bill does not provide for any third party consideration or independent appeals process. Even the CROW appeals mechanism would not provide this if applied in its current form to the coastal access provisions as the Secretary of State would be both designating land, including exclusions and restrictions, and then deciding an appeal on that designation. Noble Lords will wish to ensure that costly recourse to judicial review is not the only option to challenge the alignment, spreading room and exclusions and restrictions which should be subject to appeals mechanisms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="090421139000019"></a>On 18 December 2008, your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution reported to the House on the Bill. The committee opined that rights of appeal against administrative decisions of public authorities are an important aspect of the relationship  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1452"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between the citizen and the state. There can be no argument about that. Without effective appeal procedures, the citizen cannot easily challenge the lawfulness or merits of a determination. In situations where legislation fails to provide for an appeals system, the remedy of launching judicial review proceedings in the High Court&#151;you could not make it up if it were not in the Bill&#151;is for most citizens more of a theoretical possibility than a realistic means of seeking redress for an allegedly unlawful decision. High legal costs, the prospect of being ordered to pay the other side&#146;s costs if the claim fails and the length of time it takes for the claims to be heard are completely unrealistic barriers for ordinary people to the use of the judicial review procedure. The grounds of challenge on judicial review claims are limited to questions of law. It is rarely possible to raise disputes about facts or the merits of the public authority&#146;s decision. As a matter of constitutional principle, therefore, rights of appeal should be created.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="090421139000020"></a>The range of powers contained in this Bill to require coastal landowners to permit public access to their property ought, in your Lordships&#146; committee&#146;s opinion, to be accompanied by a right of appeal to an independent body. The possibility of making a claim for judicial review in the High Court is neither a proportionate nor a realistic option for the vast majority of ordinary people in this country.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="090421139000021"></a>Your Lordships&#146; committee is not persuaded by the reasons advanced by the Government for not including any appeal procedures in the Bill. It is said that few appeals will be successful, and that the experience of the appeals system under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 is that appeals were disproportionate, lengthy and expensive. Predictions of the outcome of appeals are not, I suspect your Lordships will agree, a sound argument against the creation of an appeals system. Indeed, we would be concerned if an appeals system led to a large proportion of successful challenges, as that would indicate that there was something badly wrong with the administration of the system or the terms in which the legislation was framed. In the absence of such an appeals system, stakeholders, or those who can afford to do so, would have to resort to judicial review proceedings in the High Court, which are neither cheap nor quick. It is in the Government&#146;s hands to recommend an appeals system that seeks to minimise both the time taken and the costs involved in allowing citizens to question the judgments of Natural England and the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="090421139000022"></a>There is no suggestion of, or support for, slow and extravagantly costly appeal processes. A measured response in relation to the coastal access duty would be to attempt to create a better appeals system rather than to exclude one altogether.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="090421139000023"></a>The Government&#146;s second reason for rejecting an appeals system is that there will be a consultation, and landowners would have a right to make representations before the line of route was determined by the Secretary of State. This appears to conflate two different steps in the decision-making process. The principles of procedural propriety, otherwise known as natural justice, require that landowners be consulted and are given opportunities to make representations before a final decision is  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1453"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1453</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made. Such a right is given express recognition in the Bill. This right exists as a matter of common law, whether or not spelt out in legislation, in relation to many if not most types of decision-making by public authorities.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="090421139000024"></a>The right, however, is separate from the question of whether a citizen should have a means of challenging the final decision after it has been made. The grounds of appeal might be that the decision-maker did not properly understand, or failed to give appropriate weight to, the matters on which representations had been made earlier in the process. The duty to strike a fair balance between different interests applies not only to the substance of the coastal access scheme but also to the procedures adopted in reaching decisions. No decision-making process in the Bill allows appeals by individuals. A balance must be struck between citizen and state in the context of the Bill. The Bill must be amended. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="090421139000027"></a>However, those requirements are not a replacement for a proper appeals system, where Natural England&#146;s decisions are reviewed by an independent and objective body. The lack of an appeals system has, as has been noted by your Lordships, led to an enormous outcry among many stakeholders. I am sure that we have all received briefings from an impressive array of interested bodies and organisations. I know that my colleagues in another place have received letters from constituents. The Country Land and Business Association, in particular, has been very helpful in articulating its concerns. The strength of feeling from almost all groups has been heavily on the side of inserting a proper appeals system. Indeed, only Natural England has indicated to me that it is happy with the Bill&#146;s current drafting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="090421139000028"></a>These are not only outside bodies; several committees have added their voices, too. I am very pleased that the Joint Committee on Human Rights selected my Amendment A357A as one that removes what it confirms is a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Of course, many of the other amendments in the group do much the same thing, but it is always nice to hear that one&#146;s drafting achieves, for once, what one intended it to do. With such an overwhelming weight of opinion against them, it is  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1454"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not surprising that the Government have indicated that they are willing to move on this point. Indeed, recent discussions have indicated that they now accept that there must be an appeals process. There is much agreement between us about what must be established.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="090421139000029"></a>First, the appeals process must be independent. For Natural England or the Secretary of State to act as judge and jury on a report and the representations received would be inappropriate and would add nothing to what has already been drafted. The adjudicating body must be able to disagree with a decision held by both Natural England and the Secretary of State, and have that disagreement upheld. It would be equally inappropriate for Natural England or the Secretary of State to act as gatekeeper to the process. Secondly, the right of appeal should be established for those who are losing something, specifically those losing control of the land that they have a relevant interest in. Thirdly, and as my noble friend Lord Goodlad said, the appeals process should be quick, accessible and as cheap as possible, while remaining credible. It is in no one&#146;s interests to tie Natural England and the appellants down in a long, expensive and arcane legal procedure.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="090421139000030"></a>Amendment A357A should achieve all these things. The Planning Inspectorate is experienced in such decisions and can act at a suitably local level to ensure that the entire process is not overly burdensome or complicated. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response, and I hope that when we return to the matter on Report we will be much further along in coming to a final agreement.</p>

I consider an appeals system to be the key to successful implementation of the Bill. As I made clear in my previous interventions, I very much favour greater access to our countryside. It has enormous benefits for the mental and physical health of our nation. With one or two exceptions, which I touched on when discussing dogs, it is not as harmful to land managers as many of them might think. Indeed, in creating greater understanding of our countryside by outsiders and bringing much needed money into the rural economy, it can be said to bring great benefit to landowners and land managers. That is my view; I accept that I am probably considered rather &#147;unreliable&#148; by many of my fellow landowners on this issue.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="090421139000032"></a>I turn to Amendment A357A. Being a natural enthusiast, I am well aware of the dangers of enthusiasm and of thinking that what you are trying to achieve must be as important to everyone else as it is to you. If you are a member of Natural England&#146;s staff spending all your working hours trying to plan this very worthy coastal access, whatever anyone might say to the contrary and however professional you might be&#151;the team working for Natural England is highly professional&#151;you will inevitably tip the scales of your decision a little, making the processes favour optimum access as against other priorities of land managers which may involve protecting wildlife or their families&#146; farming income. Natural England staff, supported by Defra and its Ministers, will undertake the extremely difficult task of trying to juggle some obvious and some not-so obvious sections of potential pathways to create a continuous coastal access around our shores.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="090421139000033"></a>In pursuit of this complicated objective it would not be surprising if Natural England, Defra and even its Ministers were not prone to interpreting the legislation in favour of their purposes rather than other valid objectives. As I said, I do not say this in any way as a criticism of the professionalism of those involved but, even if they have their enthusiasm well under control, it is vital that justice must be seen to be done. I am aware that the Countryside Agency, of which I was a chair, was accused of spending too much time and too much money conscientiously mapping the land designated under the CROW Act. There were rules and fairly firm definitions involved but the appeals process was vindicated in that case because 75 per cent of appeals were successful. You do not really need to say very much more than that. An appeals process is essential here so that justice can be seen to be done and this very worthwhile initiative sets off on the right foot, if noble Lords will excuse the pun.</p>

<a name="090421139000034"></a><b><a name="90421-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090421139000066"></a>Lord Pannick:</b> In an 1893 judgment on rating law in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Bowen stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="090421139000052"></a>&#147;If no appeal were possible, I have no great hesitation in saying that this would not be a desirable country to live in&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090421139000048"></a>That puts the case rather more strongly than I would, but your Lordships will understand the sentiment. I have added my name to amendments in this group because in the present context a right of appeal to an independent body is essential to securing the fair balance between the interests of the public in having rights of access over land and the interests of any person with a relevant interest in the land. That fair balance is the very objective stated in Clause 287(3) in relation to the coastal access duty.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="090421139000035"></a>Decisions taken under the Bill to require coastal access will inevitably have a substantial impact on the rights of those who own land or have interests in land. The reasons hitherto given by the Government for declining to make provision for a right of appeal are, with great respect, entirely unconvincing. They have given three reasons. First, it is said that a right of appeal would be an expensive and protracted process. However, it is open to the Government&#151;I very much hope that they will take this step&#151;to adopt procedural rules that will ensure an efficient appeals process. In any event, if there is no right of appeal, aggrieved persons will be able to, and will, bring applications for judicial review in the High Court. I assure the Minister that judicial reviews will be much more expensive and much slower than an efficient appeals process. It is in the Government&#146;s interest to adopt an efficient appeals process.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="090421139000036"></a>The second argument the Government have made is that landowners can make representations in advance of the decision being taken. But the right to have your views taken into account, valuable as it is, is not an alternative to the right to challenge a decision before an independent body after the decision has been made. Both elements are essential to a fair process.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="090421139000037"></a>The third and final point that the Government have made is that a decision on the coastal access duty will not only affect the land of a particular owner or occupier, but will also have implications for others. The answer to that point is that it is common in administrative decision-making for the decisions that  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1456"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are challenged to have an impact not just on the appellant, but also on a range of third parties. Obviously, a planning permission may affect the interests of neighbours. An appeal body will therefore necessarily consider the general implications of its decisions. It will hear representations not just from the appellant and the decision maker, but from any third party with a direct interest. There is nothing unusual about the present context.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="090421139000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, mentioned that the need for a right of appeal has been explained by your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, pointed out that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has stated that, in the absence of a right of appeal, the Bill&#146;s provisions are not compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. I very much hope that the Minister will tell the Committee that progress can be made on this.</p>

<a name="090421139000039"></a><b><a name="90421-0014.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090421139000067"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> I wish to make a very short impact on this discussion. I fully support the Bill&#146;s objective of giving individuals the right of way around the coastal paths of Britain. However, as someone who has managed land and farmed for a considerable time, I cannot support the principle of no right of appeal, and believe that it should be contained in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="090421139000040"></a>Whether the wording should be as prescriptive as that contained in Amendment A357A is a subject for debate. It is not clear to me whether &#147;any person&#148; or &#147;any land&#148;, as stated in the amendment, is not too wide a definition. Clearly, a landowner or farming tenant should be entitled to appeal; likewise a private individual owning or tenanting land. This would narrow the number of appeals, and other aspects could be handled by local authorities&#146; planning inspectorates and committees. However, as it is, an important point of principle is lacking. The citizen is placed in an unequal position in relation to the state. The denial of the right of appeal is indefensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="090421139000042"></a>While I accept a lot of the arguments that have been put forward from different parts of the Committee, I will put forward a slightly different perspective. There is no doubt that there has been enormous pressure from various committees of this House, Joint Committees and committees of the other place, to put something in the Bill that allows people who own or have an interest in land to object and to make representations to an independent person in a way that is not present in the Bill at the moment. We believe that these concerns are legitimate and must be met. Whether they should be met by the amendments that have been spoken to so far is a different matter. However, in some way the Bill must be amended. There has been a developing discussion about this and there has been a series of meetings between Ministers and Members from all sides of the House, as well with people outside the House. What I have to say is intended to be constructive and non-oppositional,  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1457"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which I hope is what I have been doing throughout this part of the Bill. It is important that the coastal access provisions are carried through into law and succeed.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="090421139000043"></a>Much of the resistance to any sort of appeal mechanism comes from the experience of the CROW Act, where the appeals system has not been a tremendous success. It has resulted in considerable delays; it has been expensive, legalistic and if it were being done again people would look for a different system. It was almost exactly based on planning appeals in a different context. The result of it has been that in many cases mistakes have been made in the allocation of land. In many parts of the country, that has resulted in illogical, sometimes jagged boundaries and wrong decisions, as viewed from any standpoint, over particular pieces of land. The 10-year, or decadal review is beginning to grind into action and I hope that that will put right some of the wrong decisions, which have been wrong in both directions. There should have been access land that is not and other land has been classified as access land that ought not to have been so classified.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="090421139000044"></a>The CROW appeal system is not appropriate for this Bill. Both planning and CROW appeals are against decisions by lower authorities&#151;local authorities and Natural England respectively. The appeal is made to the Secretary of State and is dealt with by the Planning Inspectorate. That is what happens in most planning and CROW appeals. The difficulty in this Bill is that the decisions will be made not by Natural England but the Secretary of State. The proposals under the coastal access scheme will be made to the Secretary of State, so the traditional appeal to the Secretary of State is clearly not appropriate.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="090421139000045"></a>What principles should apply? First, we should avoid the problems under CROW. That is a negative principle, but on the basis of experience we do not want to replicate that. Secondly, we should give landowners and other people with interest in land a right of challenge to an independent person, and there should be an expectation that that independent decision at least in most cases will be carried through. Thirdly, it should provide for third-party involvement in a way that often happens in planning and CROW appeals, and which ought to happen under appeals or reviews under this system. Fourthly, the number of appeals and reviews should be as low as possible, and to do that the process must be as good, consultative, involving and inclusive as possible before the reports are published. Fifthly, it should be much quicker than the CROW system has been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="090421139000046"></a>We know that the Government are seriously considering what they should do and have been unofficially circulating a number of papers and proposals. What I am proposing today should lean heavily on what the Government have been discussing, and one reason for my proposals is to give the Government an opportunity to explain their thinking. I hope that they will take that opportunity. The difference between my proposals and what the Government have been talking about is that I think there should be greater third party involvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="0904227000001"></a>My proposals are set out in Amendment A350AB, which can be summarised as saying that the Secretary of State must appoint a person to carry out an

The review has to consider all the representations that the Secretary of State refers and may consider representations from the second category.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="0904227000002"></a>The independent person conducting the review has to do it publicly and openly. They must,</p>
<ul><a name="0904227000110"></a>&#147;publish details of the matter ... to be reviewed&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0904227000085"></a>and,</p>

<p><a name="0904227000087"></a>if they wish. They must,</p>
<ul><a name="0904227000113"></a>&#147;recommend to the Secretary of State&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0904227000088"></a>either,</p>
<ul><a name="0904227000114"></a>&#147;that no modifications should take place&#148;,</ul>

<ul><a name="0904227000115"></a>&#147;back to Natural England with a recommendation that ... one or more of the matters that have been reviewed&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0904227000090"></a>should be considered again. If that happens,</p>
<ul><a name="0904227000116"></a>&#147;Natural England must prepare and submit a report to the Secretary of State ... on those matters that are the subject of a recommendation from the independent review&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90421-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0904227000003"></a>That is not exactly the system of independent appeals that exists in many areas, but it is a satisfactory compromise along the lines on which I believe the Government are thinking. If that is true, they will have our full support in going ahead, for it satisfies the human rights of those with interests in land but, at the same time, does not prejudice and obstruct the carrying-out of a sensible scheme.</p>

<a name="90421-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0904227000004"></a>Our final amendment, briefly, is Amendment A350ZZA, which looks again at the question of fair balance being the only reason for a review, and the only issue that should be looked at. Quite clearly, within the context of the scheme as laid down, the concept of fair balance is reasonable and necessary. However, it has to be seen firmly within the objectives of the coastal access scheme. If fair balance is to be the criteria by which appeals are judged, then that has to be done not in a vacuum&#151;as if nothing else existed in the world, and there was no intention to have the scheme&#151;but within the context of the two fundamental objectives of the coastal access scheme, on producing a continuous coastal path and on the access land at the coastal margin. Unless it is looked at within that context, there is scope for a great deal of mischief and obstruction of what I hope Parliament will decide that it wants to see.</p>

The Government know that agriculture and the productive use of land is extremely important now; they also appreciate the importance of small businesses.

What we are agreeing, around the Chamber, is that the system is, perhaps, too long-winded and too expensive. I hope, then, that we are looking for something slightly shorter in its length of time and in coming to decisions, but there should be an appeal system because the Bill will, clearly, fall on its face without one.

I am clearly mindful of the report of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, from his Select Committee. Most recently, the Joint Committee on Human Rights has raised similar concerns. I noted in particular the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, about JR procedures not being particularly accessible to many of the people who would be affected, but there will be some, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, who will pursue JR, and he points out the potential cost to Her Majesty&#146;s Government in dealing with those matters.

It is clear that some form of review mechanism would be beneficial in reaching the consensus I have mentioned. I have circulated a paper setting out a possible review mechanism which would enable the Secretary of State, where it appears to him that a person with a relevant interest is seeking a modification or making any objection to Natural England&#146;s proposals, to forward them to an appointed person for review. We envisage that this would be an inspector from the Planning Inspectorate. We also need to look closely at how the views of all interested parties are considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0904227000014"></a>I also agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, and wearing my Defra hat it would be very hard not to agree with her, about the particular needs of agriculture and SMEs in having a system that they can use without the prospect of great expense. We will seek to meet all those points.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0904227000015"></a>However, we then come to the very interesting amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. He did not put forward Amendment A350ZA, but he put forward Amendment A350AA. That really is about the status of representations. The noble Lord knows that we do not believe it would be helpful if just anyone were able to invoke a review mechanism, partly for the reasons just referred to about not wanting to have an excessively expensive and time-consuming process. We do believe, however, that landowners, lessees and occupiers of land have a particular interest in the land they own or occupy and this, we think, has been recognised by the most recent report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. This speaks about providing a right of appeal to those affected by the designation of public rights of access over private land. That is the basic premise on which we are working in drawing up a suitable mechanism.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0904227000016"></a>Of course, however, I fully understand the point the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is making about the need for everyone with an interest in coastal access to have an opportunity to put forward their views on proposals for access. For any mechanism we draw up, it is important to me that the proposals will not be seen and commented on by these groups. What I would envisage is this: if, for instance, as a result of the review mechanism, an objection made by a landholder, lessee or occupier is upheld, one outcome might well be that Natural England would be asked to draw up revised proposals on the piece of land in question. That would then be subject to consultation and representation

That is the kind of process we envisage; it would ensure the involvement of all interested parties, but after the review mechanism had taken its course.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0904227000017"></a>I hope noble Lords will feel that I have responded constructively to the very serious points raised. There have been useful discussions, and we shall continue with them. I very much hope that I can bring in an amendment on Report which, if it will not satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on the specific point he is raising, will answer the generality of the points. At the end of the day, we want a consensus approach and we want landowners, lessees and tenants to have confidence. I believe that the kind of review mechanism we are proposing will enable that to happen.</p>

I do believe that something close to a consensus can be reached. Consensuses are sometimes 85 per cent agreement with people disagreeing at the edges, but that is better than disagreeing fundamentally. So I congratulate the Government on the work they are doing.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0904227000019"></a>There are two issues about third party involvement. One is whether third parties should have the opportunity to initiate a review. As a result of representations made by third parties on a report, the Secretary of State could decide to have a review, which is what I was suggesting. I understanding why the Government are saying that this should not happen, and I would not press that very vigorously.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0904227000020"></a>But the second question is whether, if a review takes place, third parties should have the right to have their say, to make representations during that review. That would be in line with planning appeals and CROW Act appeals, where, at the moment, third parties have that right. They do not initiate the appeal: the appeal is initiated by landowners. But anyone who has previously made comments on that particular piece of land, in relation to the CROW Act or a planning application, is almost always given the right to put their oar in. That does not necessarily take up a great deal of extra time or energy or expense. It is just a fair part of the system, and I would hope that the Government would consider that second point, if not the first. But I do express some satisfaction with the way this is going.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0904227000027"></a>I am very grateful for the Minister&#146;s response to the group of amendments that we have just debated, because clearly a right of appeal needs to be built into the Bill. I also believe that there should be some form of compensation, because areas of land may well be taken from those who own them to provide access, and that will be done in a compulsory fashion.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0904227000028"></a>I start by reminding the Committee of my membership of the National Farmers&#146; Union, the CLA, the Countryside Alliance and the National Trust, but it is the CLA and the NFU that have particularly raised the issue of compensation.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0904227000029"></a>The Minister said earlier that the Select Committee criticised the Government&#146;s response to its recommendations on rights of appeal, and that is true also concerning the whole question of compensation. I turn, first, to the ninth report of the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, Session 2007-08. On page 20, it clearly says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="0904227000100"></a>&#147;The Bill should give Natural England the power to offer compensation to owners and occupiers who can demonstrate financial loss as a result of the coastal access provisions where such compensation is necessary to achieve the fair balance between public and private interests that the Bill requires&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1463"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0904227000030"></a>Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and I both sat on the Joint Committee of both Houses. Again, its report says, on page 92, that most interested parties agree that compensation should be available in particular cases of demonstrable loss. There was also agreement that there should not be a presumption of compensation for all landowners and occupiers. Even though the Government are going to come up with some suggestion of right of appeal, they should also consider adding some form of compensation to the Bill. It is late and most noble Lords who are in the Chamber at the moment are well aware of this amendment, so without further ado I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="0904227000031"></a><b><a name="90421-0015.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0904227000133"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> The noble Baroness was pleased with my response to the previous discussion about appeals or a review mechanism. I suspect that this is not going to be so positive for her, though I am very grateful for the succinct way she has drawn out the issue. Essentially, her amendment would mean that Natural England would have to pay compensation for any loss caused by coastal access if it could be shown that the value of a person&#146;s land had depreciated, or that the person had suffered damage by being disturbed in his enjoyment of the land. I am afraid that I am going to resist this. The Bill has been drawn up so that the implementation of a new right will take account of the interest of landowners and minimise any impact on business. It is worth pointing out that land covered by buildings, or the curtilage of such land, will be excepted from the right of access. We expect the overall impact on business to be positive&#151;I do not know if I can pray the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, in aid of that as a general point, but I will tempt fate in seeking to do so.</p>

<a name="90421-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0904227000032"></a>The right of access was introduced under the CROW Act and we now have experience of it working and working well. We do not consider that it is appropriate that compensation should be provided for and, as far as the landowner&#146;s interests being protected if there is no right of compensation, I refer the noble Baroness to Clause 287, which requires the Secretary of State and Natural England to strike a fair balance between the interests of landowners and the interests of the general public. As I have made clear, since the Government are clearly committed to introducing a review mechanism, we think that we have the balance right.</p>

Even so, that leaves me somewhat uneasy. He is virtually saying that the Joint Committee has got it wrong; that is how I read it, shorthand. I do not think that it has got it wrong, so on this occasion I am grateful to him for the very positive way he has tried to facilitate the various issues that we have raised throughout debates on the Bill, but I may well want to come back to the amendment at a later stage; it depends on the appeals system.</p>

<p><a name="0904227000091"></a>If you are taking away something that belongs to somebody and you are not in any way considering giving them any compensation, I do not think that is compatible. I am only sorry that one or two of our legal friends are no longer sitting in their places, but I would like to give it thought before we come back on Report. I am well aware of the difficulties that we experienced when we were taking the CROW Act through and then the consequences of the appeals system being rather long, so it has not helped itself, but there should be some form of compensation in there. However, I shall leave that for another day.</p>

New subsection (2) clearly specifies that Natural England must abide by the approved proposals for long-distance routes, which would otherwise come under Section 2(1) of the CROW Act. This is very sensible because, in areas where Natural England has control, the coastal access scheme will not work unless it is required to follow its proposals. Bearing this in mind, it seems to make very little sense to then allow Natural England powers,</p>
<ul><a name="0904227000117"></a>&#147;to revoke or vary the direction after it is made&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0904227000092"></a>Indeed, that seems to undermine the reasoning behind subsection (2). Will the Minister tell us why this should be the case? How much control would this afford to Natural England over the direction and designation of the route?</p>

Furthermore, it limits the extent of spreading room to 2 metres on either side of the designated line of coastal route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0904227000040"></a>Amendment A359B reinforces these changes by removing the proviso in the Bill that states that any restrictions on access under Chapter 2 which apply to land that has become coastal margin land have no effect after the preparation period. In contrast, our amendment ensures that these restrictions remain and are instead incorporated into the &#147;approved proposals&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0904227000041"></a>These restrictions are necessary and important. They place a limit on spreading room in terms of its physical extent and in terms of allowing owners, factors of land management and persons interested in the land to maintain their legal rights as under CROW and have a say in the use of their land. We believe that this is crucial to ensure a balance between the importance of the path and the relevance of other uses of the land. We believe that spreading room must be catered for, but not at the expense of other land use.</p>

<p><a name="0904227000093"></a>which the relevant authority must carry out.

It would also add a degree of flexibility that is necessary for this coastal access path. It is important that we remember that while continuous access to the coast is important, other factors must be taken into consideration to which we should be able to adapt. It may mean that there is a short period where access to a certain part of the coastal path is restricted or denied. Nevertheless, this would not be for very long. It would not need to involve a great deal of the path; nor, indeed, is it too big a price to pay for maintaining the delicate balance with the flora and fauna that most people will go to visit.

People with an interest in the land will also be able to ask Natural England to propose restrictions, for example for reasons of land management, and can make representations to the Secretary of State if Natural England does not do this. The need for these restrictions will be considered by the Secretary of State. After the initial alignment process, landowners and those with an interest in land will be able to apply for further restrictions if circumstances change, and they will be able to make representations if these are not agreed.</p>

We have already published a paper setting out the changes we envisage will need to be made, but we will review these in the light of the consultation process. We will look in particular at whether different regimes are appropriate for the route slip and the wider coastal margin. We need the benefit of that consultation and other debates both in this House, which I can anticipate on Report and beyond, and in the other place, will help to guarantee that we get this right. Our view, therefore, is that the provisions in the Bill for full consultation with owners and occupiers about the alignment of the

We do not see the need to insert a new provision in the Bill, and although I share with the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, the concerns he has expressed in his amendments, I hope he will accept that the Government have considered these issues fully and that the Bill pursues a road which guarantees that what he seeks in his proposals for the way in which Natural England is to operate is already in the Bill. Given that, I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

It is not surprising that people are concerned about the impact it might have on their holdings, farms and property. This group of amendments ties in well with our discussions on the previous few sets of amendments where we have considered the relative rights and responsibilities of owners and the community at large as regards access to a coastal path.

To some extent this was covered earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington. It would be helpful if we had a much clearer idea, not necessarily of how the new coastal route and the coastal margin will fit into the planning system&#151;although they will have to fit into local development plans&#151;but how there will be a relationship between them. This is not a particularly coherent amendment, I regret to say; it is not one of my best. As we did not reach it last time, I promised myself I would rewrite it during the Recess, but I found other things to do like going to football matches.</p>

<a name="90421-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0904227000053"></a>There are two aspects. One is how the existence of coastal margin land, particularly the coastal route, will be portrayed within the local development framework. It clearly will be because long-distance routes tend to appear on the local map at the moment. That question is not dealt with in this amendment. The second aspect is what happens when there are applications for planning permission or development consent for major infrastructure projects to the new Infrastructure Planning Commission. What will happen to the coastal route as a consequence of these planning applications and what will be the process by which this happens? These important matters ought to be considered. Natural England will clearly be at the forefront of looking at the effect that planning applications and potential developments have on the coastal route, but there needs to be a formal process. If it is an application for planning permission to a local authority, Natural England will probably be a consultee already in that process. It is not a statutory consultee under the Planning Act 2008 for applications for development consent but it ought to be if it affects a long-distance route, particularly the coastal route and the coastal margin. It ought to have the opportunity to make representations about the planning application as it is being considered. I am not suggesting that in most cases the existence of the coastal route will be a major material consideration in looking at a major planning application, but it might be. It certainly ought to be an important consideration in looking at a small local planning application to a  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1469"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1469</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>local authority. The fact that a small development might have a significant effect by obstructing or in some way worsening the experience of the coastal route and the coastal margin ought to be something the local planning authority has to consider. It may not regard it as being the most important thing and it may give planning application after all, but if opinion is divided 50:50, it may tip the balance. On some parts of the coast, a planning application that threatens to spoil a major local tourist and recreational feature may be very significant indeed. At that stage, Natural England ought to have a clear statutory involvement and be able to make representations if it wants to.</p>

<a name="90421-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0904227000054"></a>If a planning application that affects the coastal route is granted, there ought to be a clear process for dealing with the implications, either by organising replacement coastal margin land or by providing an alternative route, as part and parcel of the process of the planning application. This is kind of thing that local authorities deal with every day in planning applications and it ought to apply in this case. If it does not, Natural England should still have the responsibility to take action, by an appropriate diversion or some other way, to repair the damage that is being caused to the coastal route.</p>

<a name="90421-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0904227000055"></a>I am probing how the planning system and the coastal access system will interrelate and how things will happen at different stages of the planning process, from people applying for planning permission to developments being carried out. It would be helpful if the Government were much clearer than they have been so far on these matters. I beg to move.</p>

Of course Natural England will be involved in any proposed development that is likely to affect the coastal route, but I refer to the comments that I made a moment ago about the natural enthusiasm of those involved, which will inevitably steer Natural England to go for the option contained in subsection (4)(a) in the proposed new clause, as that will be its route: it is much easier to object to a development than to rethink the route and the bits of the route on either side of the development, as obviously there has to be continuity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0904227000057"></a>This is just the sort of example that worried me when I spoke in favour of Amendment A357B on the importance of flexibility to accommodate future development. Of course planners must acknowledge the existence of the coastal route when considering any proposed development on our coast, but I would prefer it if the options contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (4) were the options of first resort and it was the local planning authority or the IPC that decided that, in the light of the alternative routes being put forward either by Natural England or by the developer, the existing route was irreplaceable. It should be the planning authority that decides whether that is a material consideration in the planning decision on the proposed development.</p>

<p><a name="0904227000094"></a>We would not wish to limit any further the rights of those with relevant interests in affected land. We have heard from the Country Land and Business Association&#151;the CLA&#151;of its strong opposition to the amendment. In previous discussions, I understood Defra to say that the Bill as drafted meant that the coastal route or margin would have no impact on any planning decisions that the landowner might seek in future. I understood the principle to be the same as in the CROW Act, where the owner is free to change the use of the land and the right to roam will be amended accordingly. I would welcome assurances from the Minister on that point. If the landowner wishes to develop their property, whether it be planting a new wood, ploughing up a bit of grazing, building a new cottage or extending a business premises, they should be able to do so, subject to existing planning law. The coastal route and the coastal margin is about making suitable land accessible to the public. We do not want to sterilise our coast or create a pseudo-national park by saying that the existence of a coastal path is a material planning consideration in the determination of a planning application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0904227000060"></a>My noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach sought in his amendment A357B earlier today to require a review to be requested because of proposed or actual changes in land use. The ability to change land use was strongly supported by my noble friend Lady Byford and by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington. I am pleased that he spoke again to this amendment. If local authorities feel there is sufficient need for a new route or right of way, which of course is taken into account in planning decisions, there are procedures in place for that to happen. This Bill should not be used to hamper the ability to change land use. To limit what owners can do with their own land would be a significant restriction, far greater than the impact we have been talking about so far.</p>

We expect the process of consultation which Natural

It is not conceivable that Natural England would be unaware of nationally significant developments. Should there be developments after the route has been put in place, Natural England will have the power under Section 55 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to draw up a report proposing a variation of the route. For these reasons, I believe that we have adequate powers as far as Natural England is concerned to respond to the issues of development and I do not think that it is appropriate for the coastal access provisions to be specifically included in the Planning Act, which was also the burden of the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0904227000064"></a>However, the case has not been made for what would be substantial amendments to this legislation. We have considered how Natural England will cope with the problem, which is of some significance. It will consider planning applications where access is already an issue. There will obviously be only one consideration that the planning authority must weigh up. The planning authority has its clear obligations under the Bill and this aspect must be taken into the balance. That is somewhat different from the burden of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. The planning authority will also take into account the interests of the local economy, the position of local landowners and the possibility that the route could be varied to avoid the development without any cost to the enjoyment of those who tend to use the route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0904227000065"></a>I recognise the important point on development that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has raised.

I will explain why I am confused in a minute. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, that there is nothing in this amendment that suggests that the coastal route should be the only thing that is considered, or that any other kind of development should necessarily be ruled out. It does not say that at all. Nor does subsection (4)(a) say that. All that subsection (4)(a) states is that it should be &#147;a material planning consideration&#148; along with all the others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0904227000067"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, said that it should not be a material planning consideration. I am confused about that. I do not understand why it should not be,

By setting up the coastal route and access land as it stands, you effectively change the land-use designation of that area. You allow people access to recreational areas that they do not have access to at the moment, and you create a long-distance route. That long-distance route will certainly appear in local development framework documents, or what we now call the local plan. I cannot see that it can possibly not appear in those documents. Once it appears in them, it is part of the planning system.</p>

<a name="90421-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0904227000068"></a>I understand the difference between the designation of land under CROW and the long-distance route, but the long-distance route will not be designated under CROW. It will be designated under the 1949 Act. A long-distance route such as the Pennine Way or the south-west coastal path is already a material planning consideration for any development that would take place and would affect it. That is my view; if the Government think that I am wrong, I would like to hear from them because I do not claim to be a total expert on this.</p>

<a name="90421-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0904227000069"></a>I am absolutely certain that these matters are considered. They will certainly be a cause for objections to developments next to or on the path of the long-distance route which people think are inappropriate. I cannot conceive that the planning system would not consider those objections fairly and objectively. This is not to say that it has to overrule everything else. There seems to be a lack of understanding among some noble Lords about how the planning system works. People are allowed to put in objections. Just because Natural England would be a statutory consultee under my proposals and be able to say, &#147;No, this would be disastrous and should not be allowed&#148;, or, &#147;If you are going to do it, this is how we would divert it&#148;, does not mean that the local planning authority or the Infrastructure Planning Commission would regard that as the be all and end all. It may say, &#147;We have considered these representations but on balance we are going to give planning permission&#148;. That happens all the time. I believe that Natural England is probably already consulted automatically by a lot of planning authorities on a lot of applications. Therefore, I do not understand what the objection is to the measure.</p>

<a name="90421-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0904227000070"></a>I am confused because on the one hand we were told that these matters are nothing to do with this Bill and everything is okay, but on the other we are then told by the Minister that Natural England may well make representations, which will be considered along with all other representations, which is what I would expect. The local planning authority will then make a balanced decision. Surely that is what will happen, so I do not understand why the essence of the amendment, although not the wording, is being resisted. I am really trying to probe how this will work. What will be the relationship between the long-distance route and the planning system both in terms of overall planning&#151;the development of local development frameworks, for example&#151;and in terms of dealing with particular planning applications and what Natural England has to do if a development takes place which radically affects the route or the coastal margin, but particularly the route? What responsibilities will Natural England

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0904227000072"></a>My amendments in this group probe the implementation and maintenance of the coastal route. There are a great number of small amendments here. Therefore, I shall try to speak to the larger issues on which I hope to receive further clarification. First, I wish to address the question of the work done to establish the route. Schedule 19 raises the possibility of some serious works being necessary. Paragraph 2(3) speaks of clearance and the removal of obstructions such as walls. When I first read through the schedule, I was pleased to note in Paragraph 2 that this will all be done with the agreement of the owner or occupier, and that Natural England or the access authority will bear the costs except where the owner agrees to undertake the works himself. Unfortunately, I then turned the page and realised that that is not the case under Paragraph 3. Here Natural England or the relevant access authority is able to come on to private land and start chopping down trees, filling in ditches and digging up walls in order to smooth the way for the coastal route. I hope that the Minister will assure us that sub-paragraph (3) is to be used only in the most extreme cases where Natural England has done everything it can to gain the proper permission for the works, and that in that case the owner or occupier would not be expected to fund any proportion of them.</p>

<a name="90421-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0904227000073"></a>I should also like clarification on why yet another definition of who has a relevant interest in the affected land, beyond those that we have already discussed, is being used. I should also like to hear more about how much disruption to the landscape the Minister thinks is appropriate for the creation of the route. It cannot be in anyone&#146;s interest to destroy natural wildlife habitats. This links to earlier discussions about whether the route is to be four metres wide where possible. Obviously, considerably more chopping down, filling in and digging up will be necessary if four metres is to be the standard. I hope that Natural England would rather reduce the width of the route than undertake significant works. I should also like confirmation that none of these works may be undertaken for the purpose of extending the coastal margin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0904227000074"></a>Secondly, I turn to notices and signs. My amendments probe where it might be necessary to change the signage on someone&#146;s land without consulting them, and when Natural England might not bear the full cost of such signage. They also express the hope that an indication of the extent of the coastal margin will be included on the signs, and that Natural England must reasonably respond to complaints by relevant people that signage is inadequate&#151;perhaps where the public frequently wander off the route onto land where there is no access. I beg to move.</p>

Many of us, including from the government Front Bench, have spoken on Part 9 and the importance of involving locals in the implementation of coastal access. The involvement&#151;and support, where possible&#151;of local authorities, parishes, landowners and farmers will be crucial to the effective operation of the whole initiative. If a local landowner, farmer or parish says that there are problems with walkers getting lost, or wandering where they should not be, it is entirely right that Natural England should have to respond with a helpful sign. Even if Natural England thinks that the route is perfectly obvious, it will be the locals who know what is happening on the ground, and their support will be needed to make the scheme work effectively. This is an eminently sensible amendment.</p>

For example, it enables Natural England to enter land for the purpose of surveying in connection with the preparation of a report to the Secretary of State proposing a coastal route. It provides for Natural England or the access authority to enter land for the purpose of identifying whether any works are necessary to facilitate use of the route, and for carrying out such works; and it enables Natural England or the access authority to enter into agreements with landowners or occupiers about the carrying out of works, and to make payment for the carrying out of works. Where a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached, Natural England or the access authority will be able to carry out the work themselves. The schedule sets out the steps that must be followed, and the right of appeal for landowners, before such work commences. It also provides for the signing of the route and of the boundaries of the spreading room.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0904227000077"></a>The substantive response that I will give to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, answers the question, &#147;Will this power be used in a proportionate way and will the compulsion be used in exceptional circumstances?&#148;. I fully accept the point that he is raising. We very much hope that works will be done by agreement, and that the reserve powers of intervention will be used only on rare occasions. The whole premise of this legislation is to ensure that, wherever possible, there is consensus.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0904227000078"></a>Amendments A362B to A362E would mean that it would not be possible for Natural England or the access authority to enter into agreements with owners and occupiers for the clearance of land to facilitate the use of the route by the public, or to facilitate rights of access by bicycle or horseback where restrictions on  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1475"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1475</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those rights have been relaxed by the owner. I think that that might be said to go against the spirit of the implementation of the eastern coastal route, which should be carried out where possible by working closely with landowners. If we were to accept the amendment, an agreement for the removal of obstructions such as a wall, fence or other barrier could not be entered into. Where the optimum siting for the route requires clearance or the removal of an obstruction to make it accessible, Natural England or the access authority ought to be able to enter into an agreement with landowners and occupiers to do the necessary improvements.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0904227000079"></a>Amendments A362F, A362K, A362P and A362R would require Natural England or the access authority to meet expenditure incurred by the owner-occupier in carrying out agreed works to implement or maintain the route. The Bill already provides powers for meeting or contributing to such costs. It is argued that the detail of such payments should be a matter for agreement between the contracting authority and the landowner or occupier taking the particular circumstances into account. Natural England will meet the costs of implementing the route and we think that the approach set out in the Bill provides the flexibility to make reasonable agreements with landowners and occupiers. It also ensures that where for whatever reason such agreements are not possible any necessary work can be carried out.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0904227000080"></a>Amendments A362G and A362H would remove the powers enabling Natural England or the contracting authority to recover relevant expenses where an owner or occupier fails to carry out the works which he has entered into an agreement to carry out and where the contracting authority carries out those works itself. In that respect the authority must be able to recover any expenses over and above its own contribution from the person with whom it has been agreed that the cost of carrying out work should be met and which the authority has incurred as a result of failure of the owner or occupier to carry out the agreed works.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0904227000081"></a>We considered a similar amendment to Amendment A362J when we discussed consultation on Natural England&#146;s report. As I said, it is not appropriate to extend the definition of those with a relevant interest in affected land to include those with other interests. Anyone may make representations to Natural England.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0904227000082"></a>Amendments A362M and A362Q would require Natural England to consult landowners and occupiers before erecting or removing any signs about the routes or warning of any hazards. The Bill already provides that Natural England must consult such persons as far as is reasonably practicable to do so. That is a sensible measure that will permit the erection of central signage and information on the safety of users where the identity of an owner-occupier may not be known or when it may not prove possible to contact them. Consultation with landowners, occupiers and other local interests will be the key to the successful implementation of the coastal access route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0904227000083"></a>Amendment A362N would add a provision that a person with a relevant interest in the land may request Natural England to provide a notice or sign. The Bill provides for consultation with and representations by those with such an interest. I am not convinced that it  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1476"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is appropriate to single out signage. On the question of an assurance that the works relate only to the route and not the margin, the answer is yes that that is generally the case. Paragraph 2(3)(a) and (b) makes it clear that it applies to the route. Exceptions arise under paragraph 2(3)(c), which relates to the margin but only where the landowner has given consent for horse-riders or cyclists to use the land under a relaxation of a general restriction under sub-paragraph (3)(e), which relates to contracting and removing walls and fences, et cetera, which we would expect to be generally related to the route.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0904227000084"></a>Overall, this follows CROW and we think that the balance is right. It is not a great big hammer to force landowners and others to do things that they do not want to do. I want to come back to the original point put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. We would expect this to be done through agreement. There may be exceptions but I hope that they would be limited.</p>

We have been trying to construct this path, if one may put it that way, on the basis of consensus and the hope that there will be a buy-in locally. I understand that there could be circumstances where the landowner is not identifiable, and it is necessary to construct a path or to do works on it. However, I am reassured by what the Minister has said, to the extent that he appears to appreciate that getting this wrong could cause many problems.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="09042218000002"></a>I mentioned the width of the route, which is laid down as being 4 metres in normal circumstances. Where that passes through woodland, or close vegetation typical of an area, the Minister did not say whether clearance of that natural habitat would be part and parcel of creating that route of 4 metres&#146; width, or whether a more natural path, which in some cases might already exist, could be adopted. I also asked for confirmation that works of this nature&#151;the clearance of woodland, scrub or brushwood&#151;would not be undertaken for the purpose of extending the coastal margin. I am particularly concerned that, if this path is to be driven like a motorway through the coastal regions, we could end up with a very negative impact. I do not suppose that to be the purpose for a moment, but we ought to be clear and I would like reassurance from the Minister on that matter.</p>

I am afraid that I might also drag the following Clause 296 into my remarks, and I hope that your Lordships will forgive the lack of an amendment tabled in my name addressing it. As I understand it, Clause 295 means that Natural England is not liable for any injury that a member of the public may incur along the route, unless that injury was predicted in a representation or request for a restriction or exclusion by someone with a relevant interest in the land. That is in contrast to Clause 296 where the occupier remains liable in much wider circumstances. That does not seem fair. Why should Natural England and, indeed, the Secretary of State be able to shrug off any responsibility for the public when the owner cannot?</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="09042218000008"></a>Clause 296 is an improvement on what went on before in the CROW Act. At least the owner is not to be held responsible by a member of the public falling off a stile as is the case on CROW land. The difference in liability between Clauses 295 and 296 is considerable. What makes it worse is that the owner&#146;s liability extends to members of the public walking across coastal margins, not just the coastal route. We have already had some discussion about how members of the public should be able to expose themselves to risk if they choose, and that Natural England need not regard their safety when establishing limits of the coastal margin. Here it appears that the owner is still to be held responsible even in this area. I beg to move.</p>

I did that not because I wish to remove the clause but because, as the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, has just admitted, nobody put down any amendments to it and that was the only way I could think of to be able to stand up and say something. I want to welcome the clause, so it was just a procedural device.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="09042218000010"></a>This matter takes us back to the debates we had on the CROW Bill nine years ago when there was quite a consensus across the Chamber that the reduced liability that owners and occupiers have under that legislation  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1478"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in relation to natural features should apply to all physical features. We never managed to get that to a vote for whatever reasons under the CROW Act, and in any case it was never passed. Since then, on CROW and access land the position has been that there is reduced occupier&#146;s liability as regards natural features but not as far as manmade physical features. One only has to think of crags that have been partly quarried and you start to ask what is manmade and what is natural. In the Derbyshire Edges you might go along the bottom of a crag and trip over a natural bolder. Then you might trip over a millstone that was left there when they stopped making millstones. Therefore, the distinction between the two is not very clear.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="09042218000011"></a>I want very much to welcome the fact that the land is defined as a physical feature of whatever kind and not just a natural feature. Looking to the future, I would hope that we might find an opportunity to amend the law on CROW access land to come into line with what will be the provisions on coastal access. That is for the future. In the mean time, I simply want greatly to welcome Clause 296.</p>

I am sure that on this part of the Bill at least this effort has borne dividends in the huge amount of consensus there is in relation to it. It is very different from the CROW Bill nine years ago. On behalf of the Liberal Democrats I would like to thank the Government and all their people for the help we have had. We look forward to locking horns again on Report.</p>

I must immediately refer to my officials, who have worked very hard; I am glad that he has made those comments and I very much echo them. I am also grateful for his remarks on clause stand part, because in one sense they are a response to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. Essentially, he is posing the question of whether we got the balance right. I believe we have; I think it is a fair balance.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="09042218000014"></a>As someone who worries about this country developing into a risk-averse society, I think that one of the most striking outcomes of the public consultation on improving access to the coast was the real concern to ensure that there would not be any action that would result in a loss of the sense of freedom and wildness which make our coastline so attractive. People do not want to see overly managed paths and a plethora of warning signs every few yards. Of course, the coast can present hazards in places&#151;we know that. But the fact is that over 70 million visits are made to what is described as the &#147;undeveloped coast&#148; each year. The vast majority of these are without incident.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09042218000015"></a>Clearly, we do not want a risk-averse approach, but we do want to ensure that people do not unduly put themselves at risk. Clause 287 specifically requires Natural England and the Secretary of State to have  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1479"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regard to the safety and convenience of those using the English coastal route. The effect of the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, would be to remove subsections (1), (2) and (3) from Clause 295. They make it clear that no duty of care is owed by Natural England or anyone acting on its behalf under the law of negligence when preparing or proposing the coastal route. This is in connection with any failure by it to erect signs warning of hazards or to exclude or restrict access.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="09042218000016"></a>The aim of this clause is to clarify the legal position. Without it, it would be up to the courts to decide whether it was appropriate to impose a duty of care in any given case. Apart from the risk-averse behaviour that that might lead to, we think it highly unlikely that the court would impose such a duty. But we do think it prudent to set out the position clearly on the face of the legislation.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="09042218000017"></a>I believe that the approach we have set out in Clause 295 is measured; it reflects the position that many who responded to our public consultation wanted us to take. People must ultimately take responsibility for their own safety. We do not think it is appropriate or proportionate that Natural England or the Secretary of State should have a significant level of responsibility for accidents that may occur as a result of people choosing to use the new right of access to the coast.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09042218000018"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, was quite right then to refer to Clause 296 and to ask whether we got the balance right. We think we do, and the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, made some very important points in relation to that. The CROW Act itself limited the liability of occupiers of access land to those exercising the right of access in respect of risks arising from natural features, subject to some safeguards. That is where the occupier has not acted intentionally or recklessly. Recognising that there are many more non-natural features on the coast than are likely to be on open country, the responses to public consultation supported reduced liability to be extended to include other, non-natural features. This clause provides for that reduced level of liability, subject to safeguards that the occupiers have not acted intentionally or recklessly.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="09042218000019"></a>If, for example, a land owner or occupier has installed steps to a previously private beach for their own use, they would not, subject to safeguards which I have mentioned, be liable where a user of the right of access is injured using them. We think that the provision of reduced occupiers&#146; liability is part of the fair balance that this Bill strikes between the interests of the public in having rights of access and the interests of owners and occupiers. The reduced liability will benefit occupiers of coastal land where there is already access. We think it will minimise the burden where new access is created. These provisions have been widely welcomed by landowners and users alike, which suggests that we have the balance right here.</p>

We now come to the powers of the National Assembly for Wales in relation to the Bill. We feel that access is not wholly adequate from the point of view of recreation. We have consulted the British Mountaineering Council, which has concerns about rock climbing access and matters of that kind.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09042218000022"></a>Amendment A364B would ensure that the issues contained in Matter 16.1 under Clause 300 concentrate on the functions of the National Assembly for Wales, or the Government of Wales. In fact, the Government themselves have moved to amend the Government of Wales Act 2006 with their own amendments and through clauses contained in the Bill. The Assembly does not have the power to do this, and we are seeking to amend some of the issues which the Government have raised in Clause 300.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09042218000023"></a>Clause 300 recommends changes to the Government of Wales Act with the addition of Matter 16.1, which refers to the establishment of,</p>
<ul><a name="09042218000150"></a>&#147;a route (or a number of routes) for the coast&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042218000063"></a>Matter 16.2 seeks to secure,</p>
<ul><a name="09042218000151"></a>&#147;public access to relevant land for the purposes of open-air recreation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042218000064"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government have already committed to Matter 16.1 with a coastal access improvement programme for the all-Wales coastal path. That was started in 2007 and is aimed at improving access to the coast for local communities and visitors through local path movements. The all-Wales coastal path is due to be completed by 2012, creating a walking route around the entire coast of Wales. This is a welcome development throughout Wales, and visitors to Wales universally welcome it.</p>

<a name="90421-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="09042218000024"></a>However, there is a feeling that, in order to maximise increased public access to the coast and to match the real need on the ground, area coastal access is needed as well as linear access. That is essential to the coastal access provision for Wales, and the Welsh Assembly Government must seek to implement Matter 16.2 as  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1481"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>soon as possible. This is the only way in which access for open-air recreation can be delivered. The linear route is felt to be too limited as an access option, as it does not provide for right of access to the shoreline, beaches or cliffs, and it is important that that is achieved. Equally, as noted, footpath access will not give users the right to leave the footpath and access the coast. Landowners and recreational groups both have reservations about the difficulties in managing access limited to a footpath. We have covered a lot of that already in our debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="09042218000025"></a>Amendment A364B establishes that there is a disparity between the coastal access regimes outlined for England and contained in this Bill and the coastal access improvement programme already being implemented in Wales. Clauses 286 to 299 outline measures to create a long-distance coastal path in association with that route and a margin of land along the length of the English coast accessible to the public for the purpose of enjoyment, in conjunction with that route or otherwise, and that this will be achieved through provisions outlined in the CROW Act 2000 and changes to the National Parks and Countryside Act 1949. Crucially, the legislation supporting the coastal access scheme for England stressed the desirability of that route adhering to the periphery of the coast and providing views of the sea. On the landward side, typical land forms such as dunes and cliffs will automatically be spreading.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="09042218000026"></a>This is very welcome, obviously, but our amendments&#151;I am referring not only to Amendment A364B, but to Amendments A364C, A367A, A367B and A368A&#151;achieve the following. Amendment A364C would insert:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="09042218000073"></a>&#147;The Welsh Assembly Government must exercise the relevant functions in order to secure the following",</p>

<p><a name="09042218000065"></a>objectives, which are mainly of a recreational nature. Amendment A367A replaces &#147;relevant land&#148; with,</p>
<ul><a name="09042218000152"></a>&#147;a margin of land along the length of the Welsh coast&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042218000066"></a>which is what is desired and is in fact the case in the English parts of the Bill. This will ensure continuity and uses the same form of words as in Clause 286. Amendment A367B would insert, after &#147;at the coast&#148;,</p>
<ul><a name="09042218000153"></a>&#147;or the foreshore or is land adjacent to the foreshore (including any cliff, bank, barrier, dune, beach or flat which is adjacent to the foreshore)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042218000067"></a>In order to strengthen the meaning of &#147;relevant land&#148;, a stronger form of words is used for clarity and certainty. The form of words is taken from Schedule 3 to the CROW Act 2000.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="09042218000027"></a>Finally, Amendment A368A will strengthen the need to ensure that coastal land falling under the definition set out in Section 3 of the CROW Act is included with any new right of access. What is interesting is that there are amendments to this part of the Bill from the Government and I am keen to establish what the synergy is between the government amendments and the amendments to which I have just referred. I beg to move Amendment A364B.</p>

I am surprised to hear that that is the case and I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter. It was also interesting to hear the noble Lord say that it appears that the coastal route around Wales requires to be bigger and to contain more land than the coastal route around England. I do not know whether that is the policy of the Welsh Liberal Democrats or whether it has wider demands.</p>

<a name="09042218000029"></a><b><a name="90421-0018.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09042218000170"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for initiating this limited debate and to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, for his contribution. I will try to answer his point in a moment. Clause 299 confers important new legislative competence on the National Assembly for Wales in relation to public access to, and routes for, the Welsh coast. It will do this by providing framework or general powers for the National Assembly. The new powers in this clause will add two new matters to Part 1 of Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006. The two matters will be added to Field 16, &#147;Sport and recreation&#148;.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="09042218000030"></a>The first matter will enable the National Assembly for Wales to bring forward a measure or measures for the establishment and maintenance of a route, or a number of routes, for the coast of Wales to enable the public to make recreational journeys. The second matter will enable the National Assembly to make a measure or measures securing public access to relevant land, again for recreational purposes. Land will be &#147;relevant land&#148; if it is land at the coast or land which can be used in association with either land at the coast or a coastal route.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="09042218000031"></a>These provisions will support the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s coastal access improvement programme, to which the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, referred. It is through that improvement programme that the Welsh Assembly Government intend to deliver a new all Wales coast path by 2012. The provisions will enable the National Assembly to legislate to provide new routes and secure new areas of land for public access at the coast of Wales, in addition to those delivered by the existing programme.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="09042218000032"></a>We have not reached this position without consultation and I have to report that the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly Government believe the framework powers provided for by Clause 300 provide the right legislative framework to underpin the Assembly Government&#146;s work. They would enable the Assembly Government to bring forward a proposed measure or measures, having consulted stakeholders on the best way forward for Wales. We feel reasonably secure in that position in terms of the intent of the Welsh Assembly Government and the fact that they agree that this is the way that it should be tackled in terms of their enhanced powers.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="09042218000033"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, would require the Welsh Assembly Government to exercise the relevant functions provided for under Part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, and  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1483"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1483</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any other functions that they consider to be appropriate to secure those matters provided for under this clause. In addition, the amendments would amend the description of matters to be inserted in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act to include,</p>
<ul><a name="09042218000154"></a>&#147;a margin of land along the length of the Welsh coast&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042218000068"></a>and to add a description of coastal land.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="09042218000034"></a>With this clause, we are providing enabling powers for the National Assembly for Wales to bring forward legislation in the form of Assembly measures appropriate to Wales. The amendments would constrain the scope of the Welsh Assembly Government to propose Assembly measures in this area and would fetter the flexibility of the National Assembly to determine and reflect the needs and aspirations of Wales in improving public access to the coast. I cannot therefore see where the gain is meant to be. If there were a gain, I am sure that we would have heard from the Welsh Assembly Government already and I would not be able to talk with the degree of confidence I have about the agreed way forward. I fully share the motivations of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, as I think everyone in Wales does&#151;he already indicated just how much support there is for the concept&#151;but we think we have done the spade work to guarantee that the Welsh Assembly Government will be able to pursue their measures and achieve their objectives by 2012 as they intend to do. I therefore hope he will accept that his amendments, which have prompted an interesting debate, are not necessary.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="09042218000035"></a>The noble Lord referred to some government amendments and asked whether they have any synergy with his amendments. I am not quite sure that I can define synergy when it comes to amendments, but I think the answer is no. The reason for this is quite straightforward; the amendments are minor and technical. They are there only because they are required as a result of the National Assembly for Wales (Legislative Competence) (Social Welfare and Other Fields) Order 2008, which came into force on 11 December 2008. This order inserted a new matter into Field 16 in Part 1 of Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act as Matter 16.1. As a result, these amendments are needed purely in order to renumber the matters in Clause 300 that will be inserted into that field. If the noble Lord can accept some synergy there, we end on a happy note of co-operation.</p>

It demonstrates that the framework powers contained in the Government of Wales Act 2006 enable the National Assembly and the Welsh Assembly Government to bring forward their own measures and to manage the coastal paths around Wales in a way that replicates the will of the people there.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="09042218000037"></a>The amendments were tabled because of concerns that there was a differential between the situation in England and the apparent situation in Wales. I have no doubt that this debate will appear on the record and that the Welsh Assembly Government will take account of the concerns that have been expressed. I hope that the access within the Welsh coastal area will take account of these sensitivities. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, and again thank the Minister for his response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="09042218000040"></a>I turn briefly to the other government amendments in the group. As part of our move towards a one-stop shop, Schedule 20 to the Bill inserts a clause into the Harbours Act 1964 that enables the Secretary of State or other relevant authority to delegate the function of issuing harbour orders to another body. Amendment A370A inserts an additional provision into the Harbours Act that enables the relevant authority to delegate directly with respect to the performance of delegated functions under that Act.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="09042218000041"></a>Amendments A370T, A370U and A370V to paragraphs (5) and (6) of Schedule 20 make changes to ensure that the existing provisions in relation to devolution are not affected. The remaining amendments to Schedules 20 and 21 are minor, but essential to maintain the devolution settlement as it currently stands in relation to harbours, as well as, alas, to correct a grammatical error arising from the inclusion in Section 158A(1) of the Government of Wales Act of a definition of the Welsh zone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="09042218000042"></a>The amendments to Clause 313 are required to reflect correctly the geographical extent of the Energy Act 2008 and the repeal of the Coastal Protection Act 1949, as well as to reflect the correct position regarding the effect of the amendments to and repeals of FEPA.

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="09042218000044"></a>I should like to thank the noble Lord for accepting the rare recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and for moving amendments to make several of mine unnecessary. There are two other amendments in my name, Amendments A370TA and A370TB, which relate to changes to the harbour order that the Government are implementing through this legislation. As we have heard, the Government are attempting to make sure that an objection to a change does not automatically lead to a public inquiry. This seems sensible, given that not every objection needs to result in one, but the changes must not be of such an extent as to allow legitimate and substantive objections to be fobbed off. Amendment A370TA seeks to give the objector the opportunity to confirm that he does in fact want a public inquiry and for that request to be given due consideration. Amendment A370TB considers whether it might not be useful for national representative organisations also to be able to make an objection in addition to the bodies already set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="09042218000045"></a>That is all I have to say on these amendments.

There has been strong agreement within the Committee to make this a better Bill, and indeed its Committee stage may well be one of the longest that we have ever had during the course of our parliamentary activities. However, it has certainly been productive. With that, I shall sit down.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a><a name="09042218000080"></a>&#147;If the objection was made by the Welsh Ministers to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State must cause an inquiry to be held under sub-paragraph (3)(a)&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09042218000069"></a>which merely states that an inquiry can be caused to be held. I should like to know why Welsh Ministers cannot cause an inquiry to be held rather than the Secretary of State. It is a small but important point in the interpretation of the legislation.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="09042218000047"></a>Perhaps I may add my thanks to the Minister and the Bill team for carrying out their duties in bringing this Bill to its conclusion at this stage.</p>

<a name="09042218000048"></a><b><a name="90421-0018.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09042218000178"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I thank both noble Lords for their generous remarks. It has been a very long Committee. This Bill had its Second Reading in December and we are nearly into May. But the thoroughness with which the Bill has been scrutinised in Committee means that we can look forward to a pithy Report, focusing on the key parts that noble Lords have identified that we need to come back to.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="09042218000049"></a>On the comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, we have to respect the devolution settlement. He may be weary of this being used as a response to his questions and amendments, but under paragraphs 18 and 28 of Schedule 3 to the Harbours Act 1964, which I am sure he is intimately aware of, Welsh Ministers can cause an inquiry to be held when the Secretary of State is determining a harbour order. These amendments are simply changing Schedule 20 to ensure that we do not remove this ability. They do nothing to undermine Welsh Ministers&#146; ability to cause an inquiry to be held.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="09042218000050"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor is right; we must remember to support Amendment A371. I did everything I could to show that it was technically defective because opposition amendments always are, but in this case I commend him on the quality of his drafting.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="09042218000051"></a>On Amendment A370TA the noble Lord is right to raise the issue that, in paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the Harbours Act, providers of an application must publish notice of their application for a harbour revision order. That notice must state that any person who wants to object should do so in writing to the Secretary of State, specifying the grounds of the objection within 42 days. Paragraph 19 of the same Schedule 3 places the Secretary of State under a duty to consider any objections made and not withdrawn before making a determination. I understand that objectors are keen to ensure that they get a chance to put in a supplementary submission if, for example, having discussed their objection with the applicants, their points are not fully met. In practice, once the initial objections and representations have been made, applicants will then either come to an agreement with the objectors or attempt to answer  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1487"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column 1487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their points in a response to the Secretary of State. If there remains a disagreement, the Secretary of State will invariably seek a further view from the parties before proceeding to a decision. We think adding a requirement to seek the subsequent views of all objectors would add unnecessary complexity and delay to the process.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="09042218000052"></a>On Amendment A370TB, the wording of Schedule 20 is based on the last wording used in the Harbours Bill, which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has introduced into this House on three occasions but which up to now has unfortunately not been enacted. Central to proposals to streamline the inquiry procedures&#151;proposals which received wide support from noble Members during the passage of the Harbours Bill in previous Sessions&#151;is the discretionary power for the relevant authority to hold an inquiry. In order to achieve the long-standing aims of these modifications, the list of bodies that can cause an inquiry needs to be kept to a justified minimum. That is why the conservation bodies which act as the Government&#146;s statutory advisers were added to the list in the Harbours Bill in 2003 to put additional environmental safeguards in place for what can be large complex developments. We would like to keep the list to those bodies at this stage.</p>

<a name="90421-0018.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="09042218000053"></a>I hope noble Lords will see these as constructive comments on the noble Lord&#146;s amendments. The government amendments are mainly for clarification and are a sensible tidying up of the Bill.</p>

These amendments concern transfers under Clause 7, which allows regulations to specify when an account may be transferred. In fact, draft regulations give a complete free-for-all on transfers, which account providers have to make whenever requested and at no cost to the account holder. The Minister will be aware that this remains a source of contention with the British Bankers&#146; Association, acting on behalf of the banks. It has asked us to raise this issue again with the Government, despite the fact that it was discussed at length in another place.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000004"></a>The BBA is obviously not opposed to savers having access to their money and is committed to ensuring that account holders can withdraw their money easily, but transfers to other approved providers raise particular issues of cost, which derive from the fact that the transfer process will probably not be automated and will be reliant on paper-based systems. I cannot think of anything more unsatisfactory in relation to these small-value accounts.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000005"></a>In addition, there would be problems with the production of statements, as that would require the transfer of an account history to the new provider for the new provider to calculate the maturity payment, which requires knowledge of the account history. The BBA has also referred to identification verification of the account with the new provider, which also causes a problem. I do not believe that the problems are confined to the banking sector. In the Public Bill Committee in another place, similar concerns were expressed by

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000006"></a>My Amendment 33 would allow transfers to be made only if approval of a provider was withdrawn or if the provider was within the special resolution regime set out in the Banking Act 2009, which the Minister and I had so much pleasure working on earlier this year. Regulations should be made only in this context, which is what Amendment 34 provides for.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000007"></a>The Government should be aware that this is still a big issue, which may strike at the heart of whether there will be any voluntary participation in saving gateway accounts. That is why I have raised the matter again in Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000008"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="090421111000199"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> Amendments 33 and 34 would limit the circumstances in which the transfer of a saving gateway account could take place. It may help if I explain the position on transfers in general, and our intentions, before coming to the amendments themselves.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000009"></a>As noble Lords may know, we have said that we are attracted to the idea of saving gateway accounts being transferable between providers&#151;for example, for an account holder who moves and who finds that their current provider is no longer accessible. However, we do not expect transfers to be frequent. Unlike child trust funds and ISAs, these are short-term accounts and it is not likely that account holders will want to change providers regularly to obtain, for instance, a better interest rate. The match payment will be the same with any provider and will be significantly larger than any other return offered by the provider.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000010"></a>We also recognise that this remains a considerable concern for potential account providers, as the Public Bill Committee in the other place heard during its evidence sessions, particularly from Ms Helen Banks of the British Bankers&#146; Association. This is an issue that we will continue to discuss in detail with potential providers and their representative bodies. Whatever the outcome of those discussions, a mechanism will be necessary for transfers to cater for cases where the transfer is triggered by the account provider rather than the account holder.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000011"></a>The amendment caters for a couple of specific cases: where a provider&#146;s approval is withdrawn or where a provider is subject to the special resolution regime provided for by the Banking Act 2009. However, the amendment would not allow transfers to be made in a number of other situations triggered by the account provider. It would not, for example, permit transfers to be made where a provider ceased to act as a saving gateway provider by choice, nor would it permit transfers to be made where a provider ceased to qualify for account provider status. In such cases, the amendment would mean that account holders would be stranded and unable to transfer their account elsewhere. I am sure that noble Lords would agree that that would not be a desirable state of affairs.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000012"></a>We continue to believe that this is an area that requires further attention and a degree of flexibility. We shall continue to talk with account providers as the Bill proceeds through Parliament. I have again put on

<p><a name="090421111000014"></a>The Minister pointed out some technical deficiencies in my amendment. I take the point entirely, but he will understand that I drafted it as a probing amendment in effect, as we cannot make amendments except by agreement in Grand Committee. As I say, I will discuss this further with the British Bankers&#146; Association, but he should be aware that this is one of the sticking points, which is why I think it important that we should make progress before the Bill moves to its Report stage in your Lordships&#146; House. I do not think that we have a date for that yet, but there is some urgency behind the Government making progress on this. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That would represent a rate of matching of 100 per cent.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000016"></a>The Government have stated that they intend the matching payment to be at the rate of 50p per qualifying &#163;1 balance. We have no problem with that, but inevitably they are taking a power in the name of flexibility to set the amount in regulations and have put no maximum on it.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000017"></a>We can see that flexibility might be desirable and are aware that the affirmative procedure is required for an order under Clause 8(1). Nevertheless, we feel that there should be some overall constraint on the amount that could be paid, otherwise we will be legislating for a power that could be subverted to pay ridiculous multiples of saving, perhaps as a way of channelling tax-free amounts to certain categories of individual without proper parliamentary consideration.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000018"></a>The affirmative procedure is clearly better than the negative procedure but, as we have pointed out in many debates on Bills, it gives relatively little influence to Parliament over the Executive, since the option of voting down a statutory instrument is wisely not followed except in the most exceptional cases. That is why I have proposed an additional restraint in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000019"></a>The Bill allows for a subsidised savings mechanism through the saving gateway. I do not believe that we should use that to create a legislative framework that could stray beyond that noble cause; we should restrict it to what could reasonably be regarded as an incentive to save and not leave an open-ended power on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000020"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090421111000203"></a>Lord Myners:</b> This amendment would limit the flexibility of regulations. Specifically, it would prevent regulations from setting a match rate for the scheme of higher than pound for pound. Noble Lords will know that the Government announced in the 2008 Pre-Budget Report that they would match each pound saved with 50p.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000021"></a>Leaving the details of the accounts to secondary legislation provides the flexibility to make alterations in the future. This might be necessary if, for example, experience of the national scheme suggests that a different match rate would better achieve the aims of the saving gateway. The noble Baroness has tabled a later amendment that speaks to the need for Parliament to review the performance of the saving gateway scheme. It is precisely as a consequence of such a review, although not the review that the noble Baroness will be proposing, that we wish to retain the flexibility to make changes through regulation.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000022"></a>I agree that too high a match rate may not represent good value for money for the taxpayer. However, it is important that we are able to respond to any lessons that we learn from operating the national saving gateway and that we do not place restrictions on the match rate that regulations can prescribe. Of course, any changes to the match rate would, as the noble Baroness has acknowledged, be subject to the affirmative procedure. I therefore hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

However, in the context of a savings incentive, it is reasonable for the Government to accept that there should be some provision that restricts the power to something that looks like saving. Once you get beyond a 100 per cent match, which I hope the Government will never get to, it is not an incentive to save any more; it is some other kind of channel of money flowing to particular recipients.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000024"></a>I am not convinced by the argument that unfettered flexibility is necessary to respond to the aims of the saving gateway scheme. It might be desirable for all kinds of other things, but not for the saving gateway scheme, because once you go beyond a pound you will be in ludicrous territory. If you had to induce someone to save by giving them pound for pound&#151;or more than pound for pound, because my limit would allow

This was debated in another place and again goes to the heart of an issue on which we have touched several times: the costs that the saving gateway scheme might impose on providers and the impact that that would have on the willingness of providers to get involved.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000026"></a>The Government have wisely provided for six-monthly statements in their draft regulations&#151;we welcome that&#151;but there can be no certainty for providers that the rules of the game will not be changed once they have signed up to be saving gateway providers. If the economics of saving gateway accounts are finely balanced with six-monthly accounts, the business case could be wrecked by a subsequent decision by the Government, perhaps under pressure from consumer groups, to increase statement frequency. If banks and other potential providers have to make their business case with this risk embedded in the calculations, they may not proceed.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000027"></a>It is not only the banks that are concerned about costs. As we touched on during our first day in Committee, the evidence to the Public Bill Committee in another place showed that the building societies also had concerns about costs. Even the managing director of the Post Office, while undoubtedly optimistic and enthusiastic about getting involved in saving gateway accounts, gave equivocal evidence about the economic viability of the saving gateway scheme.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000028"></a>The amendment would provide a small protection, which would cost the Government nothing to concede. If there ever were a competitive landscape for saving gateway accounts, the frequency of statements might well increase if account holders valued them and that provided a competitive advantage. No one would need to legislate for powers to achieve that; it could just happen. But to leave open the possibility that the Government could tighten the terms of the scheme at a later stage is simply not helpful. I beg to move.</p>

We believe that this level of detailed requirement is more appropriate for secondary legislation. It is an area where we believe there should be some flexibility to enable us to respond to any lessons learnt from operating the scheme, as well as to keep pace with any future changes in banking practice. The noble Baroness does, however, make a good case. I recognise that the success of the saving gateway is importantly dependent on the availability of a significant number of account providers. While I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment, I will go away and take account of her comments.</p>

I hope that the Government will take away a lot of these issues. There has been an assumption that drafting a Bill with huge regulation-making powers is the most satisfactory way to proceed and, from the Government&#146;s perspective, clearly it is. But from the perspective of the potential account providers, the more flexibility the Government have, the greater their ability to change the terms of business after people have made an initial decision. That may prevent people from making a decision if there is too much uncertainty or it may cause a lot of difficulty after the scheme has started. I hope that the Minister will look again at this and at some of the other issues that we discussed at our first Committee sitting. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am normally one to argue for sensitivity to the costs of business, but this is one area where I think that business would like to go further than most consumers actually want.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000033"></a>Let us take the parallel case of the Companies Act 2006, which allows companies to move to electronic delivery of notices of meetings and documents such as annual reports. Once companies have changed their articles to permit it, they are still not allowed to implement it and force electronic delivery on their shareholder base. Each shareholder has to be asked if he wants to stick with hard copy or default to electronic delivery, but there is no similar protection in these regulations.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000034"></a>I am a great enthusiast of the internet, but I still tend to opt for a hard copy of annual reports. Indeed, I have refused the blandishment of my bank to take soft-copy bank statements. In each case, I am given the choice. I wish to preserve choice for those who are drawn into the saving gateway and I think that the Government ought to share that ambition. I beg to move.</p>

This would allow regulations to specify that providers should supply statements on paper unless an account holder requests otherwise, should we wish to go down that route, so the amendment would not add anything to the Bill. However, this is an area where we think it sensible to be permissive rather than prescriptive. We expect that providers will supply statements in paper form as a default, but we do not see that it is necessary to impose a requirement to this effect in the regulations. For a provider to supply statements electronically, it is likely, as noble Lords will appreciate, that the account holder will be required to set themselves up with an internet banking service and at least to supply an e-mail address. It is hard to see how this could be done without the consent of the account holder. I hope, therefore, that the noble Baroness will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

His argument depends on whether the regulation-making power can ensure that electronic provision is not forced on individuals. I shall look carefully at what he has said to see whether this is adequately dealt with. It is not covered in the existing regulations; the issue is whether the regulations ought to be looked at again. Providers have all sorts of ways of getting details such as e-mail addresses; for example, small print may say, &#147;By giving us your e-mail address, you have allowed us to use your e-mail address&#148;. We cannot necessarily rely on providers to be reasonable about the way in which they do this, because the cost advantages are so great. One has only to look at how devious companies are at slipping in a tiny piece of paper with the annual report package that says, &#147;Are you really sure you want to carry on having hard copy?&#148;. You have to find that little bit of paper to make sure that you carry on having hard copy.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000039"></a>My amendment, which is probing, says that an account will cease to be a saving gateway account if the account holder sells it, transfers it or charges it as security. My aim is to prevent a saving gateway account holder from cashing in on the maturity bonus by selling it for cash or borrowing against it. I do not think that the Government want to encourage a secondary market in saving gateway accounts, since that would go against the spirit of trying to encourage savings.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000040"></a>I drafted transferring the account into the amendment, but, in hindsight, I do not think that that is what I meant to do, because I did not intend to cover transfers to an alternative provider, which we covered in an earlier amendment.

<p><a name="090421111000041"></a>My concern is that the kinds of organisation that facilitate pay-day borrowing, for example, and other uneconomic forms of lending should not be allowed to manipulate saving gateway account holders. It would be all too easy for a person with a saving gateway account, perhaps 18 months in and wanting some ready cash, to borrow against the account or to sell the account, with the lender cashing in the maturity amount. I could not find anything in the regulations that dealt with this and so, as I said, my amendment is probing to find out the Government&#146;s approach to saving gateway account holders using their account as a way of raising money prior to maturity.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000042"></a>The Child Trust Funds Act 2004, which is from the same stable as the saving gateway account, contains specific provisions about inalienability. I should perhaps have used that as a template for this amendment, but I rediscovered it too late in the day. If a bar on alienability is good enough for child trust funds, we should have some similar restriction for saving gateway accounts. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that I can provide the noble Baroness with some reassurance. As noble Lords may be aware, we intend to provide in regulations that a saving gateway account can be held only by a person who is or has been an eligible person and must not be held on behalf of any person other than the account holder. That is covered by draft Regulations 10(1)(b) and 10(1)(g). The effect of these provisions would be that, should the account holder sell or transfer an account, it will cease to be a saving gateway account and any right to a maturity payment would be lost. Beyond those safeguards, we do not consider it appropriate to further regulate the purpose to which eligible account holders put their savings, as to do so risks overregulation and could act to deter eligible people from opening an account.</p>

There are scoundrels operating in the margin in the unbanked community that we are trying to draw into the formal banking community and one needs to be alert to minimising opportunities for mischief in that area. However, it is worth bearing in mind that the value of the saving gateway account will be small&#151;up to &#163;600 plus entitlement to any match payment earned. Therefore it is unlikely that the account will be used for security by the account holder for, say, a loan or acquisition of another asset, particularly as the option is already there to remove funds from the account. However, in my comments about the scope for mischief and bad behaviour, I am alert to the noble Baroness&#146;s point. We come back to an issue of proportionality. I am much reminded, as I look across the Committee Room to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that this piece of legislation requires us to strike some compromises. There is certainly an important one here in ensuring that the saving gateway is not so onerous or beset by regulation and control as to make it unattractive either to prospective account providers or to account holders.</p>

That would ensure that Parliament received regular reports on key indicators about saving gateway accounts.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000049"></a>Subsection (2) of my new clause sets out the information that must be contained in the annual report; it essentially asks for take-up rates, drop-out rates and the costs of the scheme in terms of maturity payments to be set out. It also covers the number of providers offering saving gateway accounts, which will show whether genuine consumer choice has been available to account holders.</p>

Another area of information that would be desirable, but not necessarily easy to collect, is the persistency of saving after the maturity date. My amendment does not try to specify every possible item of data that might be useful but simply specifies the minimum amount of data. The amendment could no doubt benefit from a catch-all  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC365"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column GC365</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>phrase calling for such information as the Treasury considers would aid an understanding of the saving gateway scheme.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000051"></a>The saving gateway scheme has been designed with the benefit of the two pilots, especially the larger one. Nevertheless, I think that the Minister would agree that a national rollout will take place in a different environment and may well show different characteristics. There is the issue of the cost of the scheme, which at &#163;100 million for the first three years, falling to &#163;60 million per annum thereafter, is not completely insignificant. Every year Parliament will be voting that money and it seems to me that it will be important for Parliament to have some basic information on which it can judge the success or otherwise of the scheme and from which further questions or debates could flow.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000052"></a>In another place, the Minister said that HMRC would provide some information, which would be considered in due course. That is not sufficient assurance that HMRC will provide adequate information, which is why I have tabled my amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000053"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="090421111000221"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> In principle, I always hesitate about demanding too many reports from the public service and government, as that is a very easy thing to do. However, I support the amendment for two reasons. The first is that the information requested in subsection (2) is very simple. If I had oversight of this scheme in the public service, I would expect to have that information. I once was a senior civil servant. If I was in that position and did not have this information, I would feel that I was not doing my duty. The information is easily obtainable; the providers themselves must surely have it. We are not dealing with a complicated request in this case. For that reason, it is not unreasonable that the information should be in the public domain.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000054"></a>The second reason why I support the amendment is that this is not a savings scheme like the sort of schemes that National Savings &amp; Investments put out from time to time. It is a different type of savings scheme. It has a policy objective, which the Government have stated: to promote a saving habit among working-age people on lower incomes and to promote financial inclusion by encouraging people to engage with mainstream financial services. Those are legitimate objectives, which I strongly support. However, they differentiate this scheme, which is why I think that we should have the information in the public domain. In my view, this will apply with even more impact to the next amendment, Amendment 40, which, as the Minister will remember, in the days before he set off for Cornwall I stated that I would be supporting. However, it also applies with some force to the current amendment.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000055"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="090421111000222"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I, too, support the amendment, albeit for a slightly different reason. I am particularly concerned, as I mentioned at Second Reading, about the issues raised in paragraph (f), which concerns the,</p>
<ul><a name="090421111000184"></a>&#147;number of approved account providers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421111000147"></a>When listening to the debate this afternoon about the need to have hard copies of statements every six months, I was doodling some figures. I suspect that when this scheme begins its operation, most people who subscribe to it will not be subscribing &#163;25 per month;  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC366"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column GC366</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they will probably be prescribing, say, &#163;10 per month. In year one, therefore, they will subscribe &#163;120&#151;if they do it every month, which not all of them will&#151;so that the average amount held in the account during the period will be &#163;60. I believe that today LIBOR is 1.5 per cent, so I reckon that the bank will make 90p on such an account. It will have to send out two written statements, which will take up all of, if not more than, the 90p. I am concerned that the scheme will simply not be viable for any account provider. It will be extremely interesting at the end of the first year to have a report that, among other things, will tell us how many account providers there are.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000056"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090421111000223"></a>Lord Myners:</b> This short debate has been most well informed. I agree with the noble Baroness about the importance of publishing data on the operation of the scheme and I agree with the contributions from noble Lords that that evaluation has to be set against the core purpose of the saving gateway as presented to Parliament. I confirm that, as is currently the case for ISAs and child trust funds, we intend that HMRC will collect and publish data on the operation of the scheme.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000057"></a>We want to ensure that the content of the data that are published is sufficient to allow as far as possible an evaluation of the operation of the scheme against the clear objectives that we have set. This will require careful consideration of the matters to be covered, in particular whether the matters specified in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would be sufficient or whether some variation or addition to that list might be appropriate. In addition, we will wish to consider whether annual publication for the period specified in the amendment would be appropriate or whether, as is the case with data for child trust fund account openings, more frequent publication would be in order.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000058"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, the legislation for other government-supported savings accounts, such as ISAs or the child trust funds, contains no such reporting requirement. Despite that, HMRC publishes detailed data on the operation of these schemes. To take one example, noble Lords may well be aware that data are published annually on ISA account subscriptions and valuations. As the Economic Secretary made clear in the other place, it may be that a similar approach is appropriate for the saving gateway. Alternatively, a broader or different range of data might be appropriate.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000059"></a>We think that it is too early to put in place any requirements on the data that should be published. We want the data that are published to be sufficient to contribute to an evaluation of the operation of the scheme. While it is likely that this will include at least some of the data specified in the amendment, it may well require considerably more detail and data, and we do not wish the Bill to lock us into an incomplete or inflexible reporting requirement. As experience of ISAs and child trust funds demonstrate, legislation is not required to ensure that appropriate data are published.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, makes an interesting point about the economics of the scheme for the account provider, to which we referred at various points in earlier discussion in Committee. Of course, he uses LIBOR as the benchmark for determining the revenue. Most banks are willing to pay well above LIBOR for secure retail deposit funds and for the  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC367"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column GC367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>opportunity to develop a new customer franchise, so I suspect that the economic advantage will be greater than the 90p that he suggests. But that would be for the banks to determine.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000061"></a>On the central thrust of the amendment, it is too early to be prescriptive about the precise detail of reporting, although I fully acknowledge the importance of ensuring that reports are made. As the noble Baroness suggests, there is a cost to this scheme. It is not an insignificant amount and Parliament will need to satisfy itself that the public are getting value for money from the scheme and that the accounts deliver their objective. With that, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000062"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="090421111000224"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> First, I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, has chipped in. I knew that he was here to help on the next amendment, but he is most welcome to comment on Amendment 39. The support of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, is welcome, for whatever reason it is given.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000063"></a>The Minister says that there is no requirement in the child trust fund or ISA legislation and that HMRC publishes information anyway. That is true, but it is not always the case that the information is there for those trying to look at child trust funds. Indeed, when Parliamentary Questions are tabled to try to find out more information, we are often told that it is not available or cannot be provided without disproportionate cost. HMRC has a bit of a track record, too, of providing what it wants to provide; it often provides information on operational matters that it likes to do and not necessarily on policy matters. I do not think that I am being unfair about HMRC in this regard, which is why I was trying in this amendment to get some basic information, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said, which would support a review in the context of the policy objectives of saving gateway accounts.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000064"></a>I shall consider the Minister&#146;s comments carefully. I do not think that the amendment is perfect, but I am not at all convinced that we should simply leave HMRC to decide what it wants to put into the public domain and then consistently bat away any further Parliamentary Questions on the grounds that the information can be provided only at disproportionate cost. If there are clear areas in which information is important to be provided to Parliament, we have an obligation to specify them, which does not preclude the Government and HMRC from giving additional information if they wish. However, there is a bare minimum data set that it might be reasonable to impose for the benefit of Parliament. I shall think carefully about what the Minister has said today and before we come to our consideration at Report, but at this stage I am not convinced. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

My previous amendment focused on information on some basic facts being provided to Parliament annually. This amendment is rather different, although the provision of information to Parliament is a common theme. Amendment 40 would require the Treasury to appoint an independent person to carry out a review of the effectiveness of saving gateway accounts and to prepare a report, which would be laid before Parliament and published. The report is intended to cover much more territory than the previous amendment, and the two amendments are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000066"></a>In subsection (2) of the proposed new clause, I have listed the matters that should be included in the review, which includes a catch-all for,</p>
<ul><a name="090421111000185"></a>&#147;any other matters which the independent reviewer considers relevant to a consideration of the effectiveness of Saving Gateway accounts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421111000148"></a>The specific requirements are listed in subsection (2) and include take-up, the extent of regular savings both before and after maturity and, importantly, what happens when the two years are up. Here we need more information than has been available from the limited data provided by the early pilots.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000067"></a>Subsection (2)(c) refers to the,</p>
<ul><a name="090421111000186"></a>&#147;barriers to the wide use of Saving Gateway accounts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090421111000149"></a>That is predicated on there being not a high enough take-up, which may prove to be incorrect. My assumption is that there is some further learning to do about what will entice lower-income people into regular saving. The average for child trust funds is that only 75 per cent are opened by the parent, while 25 per cent are not opened. There is quite a lot of variation within that, but it is quite simple to open such a fund. It does not even require you to go and put money in; it requires you only to open the account. So it is quite likely on the basis of the child trust fund experience that take-up will be somewhat lower. If we are genuinely trying to kick-start this process, it is important to keep a view of what prevents people from opening saving gateway accounts.</p>

It is unclear to what extent the saving gateway scheme will stand or fall by the financial education that is hard-wired into it. The Thoresen review, which we discussed on our first day in Committee, is still only at its pre-large-scale pilot stage. By the time this review would take place, there might well be some important information from those pilots. Indeed, there may be other sources of information to draw on.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000069"></a>As to timing, I have suggested in subsection (3) of my new clause that the review should be carried out four years after the saving gateway scheme gets going and should be completed within one year. I am flexible on timing, but that seemed to be a good sighting shot at the sort of period in which it would be reasonable to take a look at what had actually happened.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000070"></a>Post-legislative scrutiny should be an important aspect of our approach to any new legislation that charts new territory, which saving gateway accounts qualify as. There probably ought to be a default position that all Bills with new policy requirements&#151;anything other than tidying-up Bills&#151;should have some form of post-legislative scrutiny, unless a case is made that that would be unnecessary. The default position should be that post-legislative scrutiny is embedded in any Bill that comes forward. I accept that that is part of a bigger proposition and is a debate for another day, but in the context of this scheme it would be wise of the Government to ensure that post-legislative scrutiny was provided for. I have set out one way in which that could be achieved. I beg to move.</p>

It needs to be distinguished completely from Amendment 39, which concerns the annual report. This is a proposal for a report on the effectiveness of the saving gateway accounts. The argument that I advanced earlier that these are a rather special type of saving does apply, but none the less there are further reasons why it would be useful to have a report on the effectiveness of the accounts. One reason relates to the potential benefits of the scheme, which lie, as the Government have stated in the notes on the Bill, in encouraging people to acquire a saving habit, to build a stock of savings and to be brought into contact with mainstream financial services. Those benefits exist but, according to the Government&#146;s documentation, they are difficult to quantify. I agree with the Government that that was the situation when the document was issued at the end of February this year. The scheme has not started and the benefits are difficult to quantify, but it would be a good idea to try to quantify them and to see how effective the scheme is. I support this scheme but, when it has been running for some time, we need to know whether it is working or not. For that reason, I support the amendment.</p>

That aspect will potentially be valuable. My preference would be for the review to take place significantly earlier than the noble Baroness suggests, because this legislation is slightly different from other Bills that we have considered when we have looked for a review after a certain period. For example, in the Banking Act, the expectation was, and I hope still is, that it will not be regularly used and, therefore, one could specify a certain period. In this case, my concern is that there will be a very small number of providers and that, at the end of year one or two, the whole scheme could be, if not in disarray, far less effective than we all want, for that reason if no other. If we are to have such a review, I would prefer that we brought it forward, possibly to the end of year two. Equally, I would give the reviewer less than a year to produce his results.</p>

This must be carried out carefully and evaluated against the objectives that have been set. In my business career, I was always in favour of post-implementation reviews and I think that there is much to be said for the need to hard-wire into practice post-legislative scrutiny. However, as the noble Baroness said, that is a bigger proposition, and one, perhaps, for another day. I also found myself nodding in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, when he said that the fact that it was difficult to quantify the benefit was not an excuse for not going through the exercise.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000074"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, we have already published detailed independent evaluations of the two saving gateway pilots. The Public Bill Committee in the other place heard from researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Bristol University about how these evaluations were conducted. Building on these evaluations, we are already considering how we can most effectively test and measure the success of the scheme once it is up and running.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000075"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would require us to ensure that the review was carried out on the fourth anniversary of the first issue of notices of eligibility and specifies some of the matters that would be considered in the review. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggests that the review be held rather earlier.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000076"></a>I agree with the comments that have been made in this short debate that an evaluation of the success of the policy needs to take into account participants&#146; savings behaviour during and after the account and any barriers to participation in the scheme. Because we wish to review behaviours after the account, we tend to support the noble Baroness&#146;s contention that a period of four years or even slightly longer is appropriate. Yet the noble Lord, Lord Newby, says that we need to be looking at impediments on the account provider side where one might argue that the review should be rather earlier.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000077"></a>That leads me to conclude that a review is necessary and important; it will address the issues of value for money and the achievement of the declared policy

However, I am reluctant to see too much specificity about the timing and form of any review or reviews that might be required, because those might be better informed by our observed experience as saving gateway accounts are introduced. I therefore believe that the form, detail, content and timing of any review would be best finalised later, once the scheme is up and running and after further discussion with researchers, account providers, intermediaries and, in particular, financial inclusion experts. That will ensure that the design and focus of any review can take into account the experience of participants and any issues that have arisen from the operation of the scheme.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000078"></a>On that basis, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment. However, I acknowledge the importance of having proper evaluation to address the issues that have been raised by noble Lords. If I can find a way of conceding that point in a further amendment but allowing breadth and flexibility about timing and content, I would be happy to come back with an amendment on Report.</p>

I thank both noble Lords for taking part in the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, is right: this clause is quite different because it is about effectiveness rather than just routine information to Parliament. I should point out to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, who sought an earlier report, that I outlined to the noble Lord, Lord Myners, the reason why I had gone for the timing contained in the amendment. That is why I separated this amendment from the previous amendment. Some information can just flow and does not need any independent person to look at it. I accept that information on how many account providers there are is very important and should be kept in mind, but you do not need an independent review to achieve that; you need only an information flow to Parliament.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000080"></a>This is an important issue and the Minister has undertaken to take it away. There is no point in my restating why I believe that a requirement for an effective review should ideally be placed in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and I can discuss between now and Report how best to proceed. However, in one way or another, we will return to this issue on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We can see that HMRC needs powers to get back money which has been incorrectly paid; the issue is whether any limits should be placed on this regulation-making power.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000082"></a>Amendment 41 seeks to constrain these regulations. It states that where HMRC has made an error or mistake, recovery should be permitted only if the person required to account for it contributed to the error or mistake. This is very similar to the definition of official error which I believe is used by HMRC for tax credits, which constrains HMRC&#146;s ability to pursue overpayments due to errors of its own officers.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000083"></a>The draft regulations contain provisions which are much more draconian than this and specifically allow recovery in the case of official mistake whether or not the account provider or the account holder had anything to do with the error. That is the effect of paragraph 2(b) of regulation 20 of the draft regulations. While HMRC might have no mercy for account providers, the position of account holders is different and, as a minimum, they should not be pursued for HMRC&#146;s own errors where they have not contributed to them.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000084"></a>My amendment does not differentiate between account providers and account holders and I would be open to a more restricted amendment. Alternatively, the Government might wish to reconsider their draft regulations. It seems to me that HMRC should adopt the same kind of rule it adopts for tax credits and not the most draconian rule it can find in its toolbox back at headquarters. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000085"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090421111000233"></a>Lord Myners:</b> Amendment 41 seeks to limit HMRC&#146;s powers so that it would be able to recover sums that had been incorrectly paid as a result of its error or mistake only where the person from whom the sum is recovered has materially contributed to the error or mistake. It would prevent HMRC taking recovery action where one of its officers made a genuine mistake to which the person from whom recovery is being sought has not materially contributed. I can give a couple of hypothetical examples of where this might be the case; for instance, where a keying error means that a provider is reimbursed &#163;11,000 rather than the &#163;10,000 actually claimed, or where a computer error leads to a duplicate payment being issued in response to a claim.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000086"></a>HMRC will have checks in place to ensure that such errors do not occur, but it would be unwise to rule out completely the possibility of mistakes being made. This amendment would prevent HMRC recovering money if they were. That would mean that any payment made in error by HMRC would effectively become a windfall at the taxpayers&#146; expense, from which the provider, using the examples I have quoted, would benefit, unless HMRC could show that the provider materially contributed to the error.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000087"></a>HMRC payments under the scheme, including any made in error, will be made to an account provider, rather than directly to an individual. It is reasonable for any account provider to check the payments that they receive from HMRC under the scheme and to

Where recovery of a sum paid by HMRC in error is appropriate therefore, it is most likely that this will be from the account provider that received the payment, rather than from any individual.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000088"></a>However, in all cases in which an overpayment has been made, HMRC will consider the facts and circumstances of the particular case to assess whether it is appropriate to take recovery action. HMRC will, as part of this process, take into account the reason for the overpayment, including whether it was due to a mistake on the part of the Government or some other person. However, it is right that HMRC should be able to take action to recover public funds on behalf of the taxpayer in those cases where it judges it appropriate. In light of this explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.</p>

His officials have given him the most ludicrous examples to illustrate why HMRC should be allowed to use the full powers to go after individuals. The Minister was not around when tax credits went wrong. HMRC was devoid of any humanity or understanding in relation to the overpayments that were made under the tax credits scheme. That was due fundamentally to the design of the scheme; the scheme is now being fixed with a &#163;25,000 disregard, precisely because it just does not work. However, there were at the time hundreds of thousands of cases of both overpayment and underpayment where HMRC went straight into its most aggressive recovery routine. The Minister said that it will use its judgment where appropriate; I have to tell the Minister that it does not. The rule that I read out was, I believe, inserted after the issue in relation to HMRC&#146;s overzealous protection of public funds, which caused great distress to individuals, blew up.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000090"></a>One can postulate an error whereby an account should not have been opened, but people have saved into it and are not entitled to the maturity bonus for one technical reason or another which has nothing to do with them. Are we to leave that to HMRC&#146;s judgment, or are we to put a constraint on it, as I believe exists in relation to tax credits? That is the nature of this proposal. The Minister has not really answered that point.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000091"></a>For that reason, I am not very happy with what he has said in response and would like to think further about whether the mechanism that I have raised in the amendment, or some other mechanism, is the right way forward. However, I have to say to him that HMRC&#146;s track record in dealing with individuals when things go wrong, especially at the smaller end of business, which is not where its tradition is&#151;it is much more used to dealing with people with more money flowing through their personal finances, and not with people at the end of the benefits spectrum&#151;is simply not good. It is for that reason that I proposed the amendment, and I am disappointed by the Minister&#146;s response. I shall therefore consider it further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The draft regulations allow HMRC to recover money from an account provider, an account holder or someone who is entitled to receive a maturity payment. But paragraph (3) of Regulation 20 of the draft regulations says that these persons are jointly and severally liable. That means that HMRC can pursue the deepest pocket available, which will almost certainly be the account provider.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000093"></a>My amendment says that an account provider need not account to HMRC for an amount which it has paid in good faith to an account holder or other person entitled in law to receive the amount. For example, if a saving gateway account has been opened incorrectly so that a maturity payment should not be made, and if the account provider has in good faith paid that over to the account holder, why should that provider be pursued for the amount?</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000094"></a>The draft regulations seem to restrict the liability of the account provider but are drafted as to the extent that the account holder has assets in its possession or control. It would be very surprising if the account provider did not have any assets in its possession or control because there is no restriction in the regulations to assets relating to the saving gateway account. If a provider has anything in its books, the regulations allow HMRC to recover it from the account provider.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000095"></a>I hope that the Minister can explain how those recovery provisions are expected to work and how the draft regulations achieve that. I may have misunderstood them, but, if not, some amendment is required to protect those who have paid out in good faith. I beg to move.</p>

I rise with some trepidation as I believe that the issues the noble Baroness raises around HMRC go well beyond anything limited to the saving gateway account, but are a rather more fundamental concern about the way in which HMRC conducts its relationships.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000097"></a>The amendment would qualify the regulation-making power in Clause 12 so that HMRC could not recover an overpayment from a provider where the provider had paid the money to another person in good faith and the recipient had a legal entitlement to the money. I hope that I can give the noble Baroness some reassurance that the amendment as presented is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000098"></a>Paragraph (3) of Regulation 20 sets out the persons from whom HMRC can recover amounts claimed by and paid to account providers which it transpires were not properly due. These persons are, first, the account

If that were not the case and the provider has paid the amount it claimed from HMRC to the account holder, HMRC would pursue the individual account holder. Failing that, HMRC could pursue any other person in whom the overpaid amount is vested. In practice, it means that HMRC would generally seek to recover the amount from the person who is holding it. If an account provider has paid a sum over to an account holder in good faith and correctly on the basis of the facts available, it would not be liable and HMRC would seek to recover the sum from the account holder. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

First, there are the persons from whom repayment can be taken. Paragraph (3) of Regulation 20 refers to the account provider. The Minister referred to the extent to which the account provider has the funds in its possession and control, but that is not what the regulations say.

<p><a name="090421111000103"></a>Would income or capital gains tax be involved in respect of the maturity payment if no regulations were passed under the clause? Would it be treated as interest, some form of income or as a capital payment? If it is a capital payment, I doubt whether there is any need for regulations, given the annual exemption from capital gains tax. It would be interesting to know what the Government&#146;s view is of the taxable status of the maturity amount.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000104"></a>The Government&#146;s clearly stated intention is that saving gateway accounts will attract neither income tax nor capital gains tax. We fully support that. The Bill is permissive on that score, which is why I have tabled the customary &#147;may/shall&#148; amendment into Clause 14, so that the Government must create these regulations to ensure that the funds stay outside the ambit of the tax system. Can the Minister explain why there should be any optionality for the Government?</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000105"></a>Amendments 48 and 49 together ensure that if the Government make regulations under Clause 14, which deals with the relief from income and capital gains tax, the affirmative procedure must always be used. Clause 27 requires only the first regulations to be subject to the affirmative procedure. The relevant approval is only for the other place, about which we always have some regrets, but that is a debate for another time. However, it must surely be right that Parliament in one form or another has to take the positive step of approving tax-related regulations.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000106"></a>In practice, I think that there will be no issue with the first regulations, but suppose the Government then changed their mind about total exemption and narrowed the exemption. That is exactly the kind of issue that the Government should be required to come to Parliament for to explain and to seek approval. That is what the affirmative procedure does, which is a modest requirement. If the Government wish to make the equivalent change in the Finance Bill, that would have to be processed as part of the Finance Bill itself. If we are going to allow it to be done by regulation, as a minimum we believe that it should be done using the affirmative procedure, so that the Government have to come and explain why they wish to make the change.

<a name="90421-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000110"></a>Amendments 48 and 49 seek to ensure that all regulations on the tax relief applying to saving gateway accounts should be subject to the affirmative procedure. I can understand the noble Baroness&#146;s point and clearly it would be a major decision for any future Government&#151;it would have to be a future Government as we will not do this&#151;to remove the saving gateway&#146;s tax-free status. However, it is much more likely that regulations will be needed in future to reflect technical changes in the income tax or capital gains tax systems. It would not be an appropriate use of parliamentary time for such regulations to be subject to the affirmative procedure. There are precedents for this approach. For example, Section 13 of the Child Trust Funds Act 2004 provides for regulations subject to the negative resolution procedure to be made for, and in connection with, the tax treatment of investments under child trust funds.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000111"></a>I realise that the noble Baroness has tabled other amendments relating to the balance between the affirmative and negative procedures, which my noble friend Lord Davies responded to earlier this month. Specifically, she aimed to make every use of the powers to set the maturity period, the monthly deposit limit and the number of accounts that a person can hold subject to the affirmative procedure. As my noble friend said, we will consider her points on these amendments carefully. However, I believe that the arguments are less strong in this case. It is far more likely that any future legislation that relates to tax relief after the first set of regulations have made saving gateway accounts tax-free, will be required for technical reasons rather than to change the tax-free status of these accounts. I therefore hope that the noble Baroness will seek leave to withdraw these amendments.</p>

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="090421111000178"></a>&#147;( ) Regulations may make provision about the transfer of funds from an account when it ceases to be a Saving Gateway account if the account holder has not given instructions to the account provider as to the disposition of the funds.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="090421111000114"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090421111000246"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> The amendment seeks to add a new subsection to Clause 16, which deals with the transfer of funds when an account ceases to be a saving gateway account. Clause 16 sets out a rather narrow regulation-making power which will, in effect, allow a saving gateway account to be transferred into an ISA. It is welcome to that extent but the Government need to go beyond this.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000115"></a>When a saving gateway account reaches maturity after two years, there could be as much as &#163;900 in the account, or possibly more if any interest is paid on it, and something has to be done with the account at that stage. Our strong preference is for the account to be transferred into a savings-type account, for which the obvious choice is a cash ISA. We recognise that not all providers may offer cash ISAs and, hence, it would not be right to specify a cash ISA as a default option.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000116"></a>Our concern is that banks may well default a matured saving gateway account into a deposit account which pays little or no interest. This is what happened in the pilot scheme. We all know that banks and building societies rely on their customers not taking the trouble to seek maximum returns. I have rarely encountered a bank which proactively ensured that savings earned the best possible interest return. Banks may even set up a default of transferring the saving gateway money to a current account, which would clearly be the least desirable outcome.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000117"></a>In another place, the Minister argued that the Government want competition and a marketplace. That was a rather nave view because it seemed to assume that not only would there be competition between providers as to the terms of a saving gateway package, which would include the competitiveness or otherwise of a default option, but that potential saving gateway customers would be capable of differentiating between the competing offers. I put it to the Minister that both of those propositions are unlikely.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000118"></a>My honourable friend Mr Mark Hoban in another place sought to require in the Bill that the default option had to be a cash ISA or the provider&#146;s best instant-access savings account. My amendment does not seek to be prescriptive about where the money should go; it merely creates a regulation-making power to allow the Government to set default rules if the need arises.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000119"></a>If the Minister in another place is right about there being a competitive marketplace in which saving gateway customers genuinely exercise choice, no regulations would be needed; but if my fears are correct, there will be a need to act. It is not clear that the suite of

My amendment is, therefore, offered as an improvement to the Bill to provide reserve powers should they be necessary. On that basis, I hope the Government will welcome my amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000120"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090421111000247"></a>Lord Myners:</b> The amendment would give regulations additional power to make provisions regarding the rollover account that providers will put in place  for saving gateway funds to move into, once they  mature.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000121"></a>We have very carefully considered whether to take powers in the Bill to make regulations regarding default rollover accounts. This would have advantages, as the noble Baroness has said. Default rollover accounts should be interest-bearing, cash-based rather than equity-based, and should give account holders access to their money. We have made this clear to potential account providers and will be discussing these characteristics with providers to ensure that account holders will be offered the most appropriate rollover accounts.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000122"></a>However, we do not think that it would be appropriate to legislate in this area. We expect that providers will want to help their customers access the option most suitable to their needs. The representatives of potential providers, from whom the Public Bill Committee in the other place heard in its evidence sessions, stressed that providers will want to offer the most suitable rollover accounts. We want account holders to understand the implications of default rollover accounts and to have access to support and information in deciding what to do with their money at the end of their saving gateway account. The Government are engaging with a range of third sector and intermediary bodies to design and deliver support on the saving gateway. We are considering a range of options around informal guidelines for account providers on rollover accounts and are finding the industry very receptive to the discussions that we have initiated in that respect. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000123"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="090421111000248"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for that response. I understand why the Government might not want to make regulations now, but I am mystified as to why they would not want to have a reserve power to make regulations if the need arose. The Minister said that the evidence was that providers will want to offer the most suitable account at the rollover time. I may be cynical but I am not sure that banks, by their actions, have demonstrated that they proactively seek to put their customers into the most suitable accounts on a routine basis. I do not believe that my experience is unique in this respect, so, whatever fine words were offered during the evidence session, I am not sure that they can necessarily be relied on, and relied on for all time.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000124"></a>My proposition is that the Government need a reserve power if the market does not work&#151;that is, if informal guidelines do not work and the banks do not do what they say and ensure that these accounts are provided.

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000125"></a>I am disappointed that the Minister will not consider taking a power to do something which the Government may need to do if guidelines do not prove right in practice. I was not suggesting placing in the Bill a requirement other than the ability of the Government to flex this in due course. I hope that the Minister will think further about that before Report, because that would allow the Government to achieve the right result for saving gateway holders if the market did not produce the right solution. I may be cynical, but I am not sure that it will. I hope that the Minister will think about that again. I will think again before Report about whether to bring this proposal back.

What constraints and controls operate there?</p>

<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC381"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column GC381</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="090421111000195"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="090421111000130"></a><b><a name="90421-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="090421111000251"></a>Lord Myners:</b> Amendment 45 is presented as a probing amendment. It concerns the disclosure of information by HMRC to the Department for Work and Pensions in relation to England, Scotland and Wales, and to the Department for Social Development in relation to Northern Ireland, so that HMRC can establish who is eligible for the saving gateway. The clause extends the existing information gateways between HMRC and the DWP and the Department for Social Development to cover the supply of information to HMRC by these departments for saving gateway purposes. The amendment seeks to impose a restriction so that information supplied can be used only in connection with administration of saving gateway accounts.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000131"></a>I am sure that we can all agree that the collection, use and sharing of personal information must be lawful and proportionate. I hope that I can offer the noble Baroness reassurance that the use of information by HMRC in relation to the saving gateway will be proportionate and will be, quite rightly, strictly regulated without the need for such an amendment. The information that will be supplied to HMRC will be the minimum necessary to enable it to establish a person&#146;s eligibility for the saving gateway and to establish whether a person has any specific needs. For example, they may have an appointee looking after their affairs or they may require documents sent to them to be in large print or in Braille. It is appropriate that HMRC knows this so that it can communicate in a way that is sensitive to a person&#146;s circumstances.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000132"></a>The data transfer will take place by means of a secure electronic transfer. Once these data reach HMRC, there are no plans for them to be routinely used for other HMRC functions. I say &#147;routinely&#148; because there are some circumstances where it might be beneficial for data to be used for reasons that would not fall within the purposes of administering saving gateway accounts. For example, the Bill makes provision for a death payment to be made where an account holder dies before the account reaches maturity. DWP will inform HMRC where a person on a qualifying benefit has died. If the amendment were accepted, HMRC would not be able to update any of its other systems to note this fact. Similar cases may arise where information supplied by DWP in relation to the saving gateway contains more up-to-date contact details than are held elsewhere in the HMRC systems. It makes sense, both for more efficient and effective public administration and in enabling HMRC to provide better customer service, for HMRC to be able to update records on other systems if they are out of date or inaccurate. The amendment would prevent that kind of sensible and wholly benign reuse of information. I therefore believe that the amendment is too restrictive.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000133"></a>I share the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns that safeguarding personal information is paramount. The Bill, by placing the saving gateway under the management of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs, will ensure that the provisions of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which strictly regulate the use of information by officers of HMRC, will apply to any information held by HMRC in relation to the saving gateway, including the information supplied by DWP that we have been discussing.</p>

<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000134"></a>Under Section 19 of that Act, it is an offence for any Revenue and Customs official to wrongfully disclose information held by HMRC in connection with any of its functions. A wrongful disclosure may be a criminal offence, punishable on conviction by a fine, imprisonment of up to two years or both. So there are already provisions in place which regulate the use of information by HMRC and which protect the interests of the individual by safeguarding against the misuse of information by HMRC officers. The amendment would not add anything to that, but it would constrain HMRC from using information across its other functions in a way that would be beneficial to customers and enhance its economic efficiency. In the light of the assurances I have given, I hope the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.</p>

As noble Lords may be aware from the draft regulations that we have published, we intend that this declaration will include confirmation from the account applicant that they meet the &#147;connection with the UK&#148; conditions, set out in regulations made under Clause 3(1)(b), and that they have not previously opened a saving gateway account, other than an account closed within a &#147;cooling-off&#148; period offered by the account provider.</p>

We do not therefore propose that a person should be permitted to benefit as a result of an incorrect declaration. In certain circumstances, where an incorrect declaration was made deliberately, HMRC can also impose a fixed penalty of &#163;300.</p>

<p><a name="090421111000142"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would go further, by extending the circumstances in which the penalty would be applied to include those cases in which an account-opening declaration had been made incorrectly through carelessness. We intend that this penalty, which can be imposed only on individual account holders rather than financial institutions, should be reserved only for the most serious cases in which a person has deliberately sought to exploit the system. That is reflected in the amount charged and the fact that this penalty cannot be mitigated or reduced when chargeable. We do not consider that it would be proportionate or appropriate to apply this penalty to any mistakes that might have been made simply through carelessness. In the context of people with little experience of mainstream financial services, who may be concerned about the account-opening process anyway, the threat of a wide-ranging penalty could easily be a deterrent to applications to the scheme. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

It concerns the definition of the Northern Ireland Social Security Commissioner in Clause 25(7). This is the body that will hear onward appeals in Northern Ireland against decisions of the appeal tribunal referred to in Clause 25(1)(b). Clause 25(7)(b) currently provides that a tribunal of three or more commissioners constituted under the relevant Northern Ireland social security legislation would fall within the definition of a Northern Ireland Social Security Commissioner for the purposes of this Bill. A requirement that a tribunal should consist of at least three commissioners would be unnecessarily restrictive compared with the position for appeals on comparable matters, such as the child trust fund, where a quorum of only two such commissioners is sufficient. An amendment is therefore required to make this clause in the Bill consistent with the position for the child trust fund, as well as the relevant Northern Ireland social security legislation, which refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="090421111000188"></a>&#147;a tribunal consisting of any two or more of the Commissioners&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90421-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090421111000145"></a>This amendment will ensure that properly constituted Northern Ireland appeal tribunals consisting of only two social security commissioners can hear onward appeals on saving gateway matters. It does so by replacing the reference at Clause 25(7)(b) to &#147;three or more Commissioners&#148;, with a reference to &#147;two or more Commissioners&#148;. The amendment would not alter any provision in the Bill affecting rights of appeal, the range of appealable matters, or the powers of any tribunal authorised to hear appeals, and I hope that noble Lords will support it. I beg to move.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="090421113000003"></a><b><a name="90421-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="090421113000064"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Veterans and Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Kevan Jones) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="090421113000004"></a>The Government have been actively engaging with the concerns expressed by our nuclear test veterans that they and their offspring have been adversely affected by their participation in the British nuclear tests of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="090421113000005"></a>The wider published peer-reviewed epidemiological evidence to date has not demonstrated a general link between veterans&#146; ill-health and participation in the tests.  Similarly there is no peer-reviewed evidence suggesting that their children and grandchildren are at increased risk of genetic abnormalities. </p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="090421113000006"></a>The Government are, however, determined to address the ongoing concerns of nuclear test veterans.  I had a constructive meeting with the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association (BNTVA) and interested MPs on Monday 20 April.  I am pleased to report that the BNTVA has agreed to help identify a representative sample of veterans and their descendants with a view to conducting an assessment of their health needs.  I therefore announce today an intention that the Ministry of Defence will work with veterans and experts to finalise the details of research to investigate the particular health needs of nuclear test veterans and their offspring with a view to identifying priorities and taking action to improve health.  I also intend some follow-up to last year&#146;s New Zealand chromosome study.  The aim will be for projects to be of practical relevance to veterans with results delivered to a reasonable timescale.  The work will be tendered in the normal manner and should be under way before the end of this year.  A working group including representatives from the BNTVA will be established to take these projects forward.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="090421113000008"></a>On 26 February 2008 (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. <I>WS 73</I><I>-</I><I>74</I>), my predecessor, the right honourable member for Bolton West, made a Statement to the House about the performance of the First Great Western Franchise, in which she also announced a package of benefits designed to bring about real improvements for passengers. The package is worth &#163;29 million and is fully funded by First Great Western.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="090421113000009"></a>One of the elements of the package of passenger benefits announced in the Statement was that First Great Western would undertake &#147;refurbishment of Thames Valley commuter trains to a higher standard than committed in the franchise agreement to commence this year [2008] and to be completed by 2011&#148;.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="090421113000010"></a>The stated completion date of 2011 was incorrect as it did not reflect the obligation in the agreement with First Great Western, which was to procure agreed expenditure on the refurbishment of the Thames Valley commuter trains by 31 March 2012, and I apologise for this.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="090421113000011"></a>I understand that First Great Western is confident that it will meet this obligation by the agreed date.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="090421113000013"></a>A draft Flood and Water Management Bill for England and Wales and a consultation paper will be laid before Parliament today. Copies of the draft Bill and associated documents will be available in the Vote Office and have been placed in the Library. The draft Bill and the consultation paper set out the Government&#146;s proposals to improve flood risk management and ensure water supplies are more secure, and the consultation period will close on 24 July. I am inviting the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee to scrutinise this draft Bill in the coming weeks.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="090421113000014"></a>The aims of the draft Bill will be to:</p>
reduce the likelihood and impact of flooding;improve our ability to manage the risk of flooding, by clarifying who is responsible for what;improve water quality;give water companies better powers to conserve water during drought;reduce red tape and other burdens on water and sewerage companies; improve the overall efficiency and management of the water industry; andreduce pollution and improve water quality.
<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="090421113000015"></a>The draft Bill will implement the key recommendations made in Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s independent review into the summer 2007 floods, as promised in the Government&#146;s response in December. It includes giving local authorities a clear leadership role in local flood risk management, encompassing all sources of flooding. It would also introduce a modern risk-based approach to reservoir safety to replace the current system where regulation depends on size rather than the risk posed to surrounding communities.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="090421113000016"></a>In addition to the provisions on flooding, the draft Bill includes measures to improve conservation of water in times of drought and the regulation of the water industry, and it will enable water companies to develop new ways of delivering very large infrastructure projects.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="090421113000020"></a>Today I am announcing that new support to help homeowners remain in their home if they fall on difficult times will now be available. Homeowners mortgage support (HMS) will enable eligible borrowers to reduce their monthly mortgage interest payments to affordable levels for up to two years to help them get back on track with their finances if they suffer a temporary loss of income<I>.</I></p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="090421113000021"></a>This new support builds on a range of measures the Government have already put in place to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="090421113000022"></a>From today, the following major high street lenders will offer their customers HMS: Lloyds Bank Group (which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland), Bradford &amp; Bingley, Northern Rock, the Royal Bank of Scotland (which includes NatWest and Ulster Bank), Cumberland Building Society, and the National Australia Bank Group (which includes Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank).</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="090421113000023"></a>A number of other banks, building societies and specialist lenders have also confirmed today that they will offer their customers HMS as soon as possible. These are Bank of Ireland (which includes Bristol and West), GMAC, GE Money, Kensington Mortgages, Standard Life Bank, and the Post Office.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="090421113000024"></a>Lenders offering HMS will have the security of a government guarantee if the borrower defaults.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="090421113000025"></a>At the same time, four other high street lenders, Barclays (including First Plus), HSBC, Nationwide and Santander (including Abbey and Alliance &amp; Leicester) have all confirmed today they are offering comparable arrangements to their customers, while opting not to take up the government guarantee. Customers of these institutions experiencing a reduction in income and willing to make regular monthly payments will receive a similar level of support and be encouraged to seek independent money advice.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="090421113000026"></a>As a result of today&#146;s announcement, lenders covering more than 80 per cent of the mortgage market will now be providing enhanced support to their customers. Borrowers will receive independent money advice as part of these changes to help them make the right decisions for their circumstances. The door will remain open for further lenders to join the scheme, and we will be working actively with the sector to enable this.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="090421113000027"></a>HMS does not provide consumers with a payment holiday. The mortgage interest payments that have been deferred will eventually have to be paid back.</p>

It is the latest element of the extra support put in place for homeowners which includes:</p>
&#163;25 million additional funding for debt advice services;a new pre-action protocol which sets out guidance from the judiciary on the steps that a lender is expected to take before taking action to repossess; for those households whose cases reach court, free legal advice or an appropriate alternative, is available across the country;enhancements to the support for mortgage interest (SMI) support available to out of work households; anda new mortgage rescue scheme targeted at vulnerable households.

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="090421113000035"></a>I am taking this opportunity to update Parliament, following my Answers on 19 January (<I>Official Report,</I><I></I>col. 514), on whether UK-supplied equipment may have been used by the Israeli defence forces (IDF) during the recent conflict in Gaza.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="090421113000036"></a>All strategically controlled exports from the UK (both military and dual-use goods) require an export licence, issued by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on the basis of advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence and, in relevant cases, the Department for  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS123"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column WS123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>International Development. Applications are assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria and any other relevant announced policy. There are eight criteria, which set out the basis on which applications will be assessed. The most important criteria in relation to exports to Israel are as follows: criterion 2 (we will not issue an export licence where there is a clear risk that the export might be used for internal repression), criterion 3 (we will not issue licences for exports which would provoke or prolong armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in the country of final destination), criterion 4 (preservation of regional peace, security and stability), and criterion 7 (the risk that the equipment will be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions).</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="090421113000037"></a>Estimates suggest that Israel buys over 95 per cent of its military requirements from the US.  The EU accounts for a proportion of the remainder.  The UK is estimated as accounting for less than 1 per cent of total Israeli military exports.  Of the goods licensed by the UK, a significant proportion will have been for dual use goods for non-military use, or for goods for incorporation in Israel before onward export to a third country. Of the military goods licensed from the UK, the majority have been for components rather than complete systems or sub-systems. Many of the licences we have identified covering military equipment were for components for incorporation into US-manufactured platforms which were then re-exported to Israel<I>.</I></p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="090421113000038"></a>I will start by dealing with the equipment used by the IDF in relation to Operation Cast Lead which&#151;contrary to suggestions made in the press and elsewhere&#151;we do not believe contained components supplied under licence from the UK.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="090421113000039"></a>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)&#151;UAVs were used extensively for reconnaissance and targeting. The Heron and Hermes 450 variants were positively identified. Numerous export licence applications have been received to supply equipment to Israel&#146;s significant UAV industry. The great majority are subject to further incorporation in Israel for onward export and a small number approved for demonstration, research, testing and our own &#147;Watchkeeper&#148; UAV programme. We have no evidence to suggest that goods licensed by the UK were diverted within Israel for use by the IDF.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="090421113000040"></a>Tanks and armoured bulldozers&#151;Merkava tanks were deployed in support of the ground offensive into Gaza. We have not identified any UK components on the Merkava tank. D9 armoured bulldozers were used to clear ground, clear routes for armoured vehicles and there are credible reports that they were used to demolish houses containing weapons caches or tunnels. None was supplied under licence from the UK, nor were any components for them.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="090421113000043"></a>Thirdly, there is IDF equipment that was used in Operation Cast Lead and which almost certainly contained British-supplied components.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="090421113000044"></a>Combat aircraft&#151;The F16 was widely used, including for the delivery of precision-guided ordnance. No licences have been granted by the Government for the export of F16 components sent direct to Israel since 2002. British made components for F16s have been exported to the United States where Israel was the ultimate end-user.  These licences covered components for head-up displays, head-down displays and enhanced display units.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="090421113000045"></a>Helicopters&#151;Apache attack helicopters were used in the operation as part of the initial air campaign, and later in support of ground troops. Licences have been approved for the export of components to the US for incorporation into equipment for use on Apache helicopters ultimately destined for Israel. These licences covered parts for the fire control and radar system, navigation equipment and engine assemblies.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="090421113000046"></a>Naval Vessels&#151;Saar-class corvettes took part in the operation from the waters off Gaza. They are likely to have been used for a number of tasks, but there are credible reports that the Saar 4.5 was used in a naval fire support role (the Saar 5 does not carry a gun suitable for such a task). Applications have been approved for components direct to Israel for a 76 mm gun for a Saar 4.5 class vessel. We have also licensed the supply of other types of equipment for the Israeli navy; most recent cases have been for ubiquitous cabling for the Saar-class vessels and components for radar equipment. Of the cases for radar equipment most have been for air defence purposes, but they have the technical capability to be used for fire-control against surface targets.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="090421113000047"></a>Armoured personnel carriers&#151;Armoured personnel carriers (APCs) were used and these included conversions of UK-supplied Centurion tanks to carry troops, for mobile headquarters and as combat engineer vehicles. The Centurions were sold to Israel in the late 1950s.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="090421113000048"></a>It is inherent in the consolidated criteria that judgments are in part based on past practice, so evidence from Operation Cast Lead will be used in all future applications. I can confirm that we are looking at all extant licences to see whether any of these need to be reconsidered in light of recent events in Gaza. All future applications will be assessed taking into account the recent conflict. I continue to believe that UK export controls and the consolidated criteria are among the strongest and most effective in the world and are the best basis for putting into practice our commitments on arms exports.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="090421113000051"></a><b><a name="90421-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="090421113000070"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim Fitzpatrick) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="090421113000052"></a>The department has today published a consultation paper on a new road safety strategy for Great Britain. The consultation document, <I>A Safer Way</I>, proposes a new approach to road safety, ambitious new casualty reduction targets and a number of new measures to assist in achieving those targets. It also proposes a long-term vision to make Britain&#146;s roads the safest in the world.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="090421113000053"></a>The paper puts forward four national targets for achievement by 2020, as compared with the 2004-08 average. The headline target is to reduce road deaths by one-third. We propose further targets to reduce serious injuries on our roads, also by one-third, and to halve the combined total of death and serious injuries to children on our roads. Lastly, given our aims to increase levels of walking and cycling and to improve safety, we suggest a target to halve the rate of road death and serious injury to pedestrians and cyclists per kilometre travelled.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="090421113000054"></a>Our current strategy has improved road safety significantly, reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries by 36 per cent over the past decade, but eight deaths a day is still intolerable and we want to make our roads safer still. By improving our roads, our vehicles and our behaviour on the roads, we aim to develop a road safety system in which mistakes on the road do not lead to death or serious injury. We propose do this through smarter working with local partners, not through creating large numbers of new offences and regulation. We need to target action on those roads, people and behaviours most associated with death and serious injury on our roads.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="090421113000055"></a>To improve safety on rural roads, where 60 per cent of all British road deaths happen, we propose annually to publish maps highlighting the main roads with the poorest safety records, encouraging local agencies to rapidly improve safety standards. We also propose to recommend to highway authorities that lower limits are adopted on single carriageways currently subject to 60 mph limit, where risks are relatively high and there is evidence that a lower limit would significantly reduce casualties. To improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists, we propose to give guidance to local highway authorities recommending that, over time, they introduce 20 mph limits into all streets which are primarily residential in nature.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="090421113000056"></a>Improved vehicle safety will continue to be crucial in reducing road casualties. We aim to support improvements through regulation, where appropriate,  


<notus-date day="21" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS126"></a><b>21 Apr 2009 : Column WS126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but also through consumer information and raising awareness, working in partnership with industry. We expect further improvements in vehicles&#146; crash protection to be targeted around particular problems or collision types. We believe that advanced vehicle safety systems, helping drivers and riders to avoid crashes, have the potential to deliver increasing improvements in safety.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="090421113000057"></a>Our recent consultation on road safety compliance put forward measures to crack down on irresponsible behaviour and we will set out our conclusions in the final version of the new road safety strategy. Our proposals in the compliance consultation included tougher penalties for extreme speeding, and tackling drug-driving and drink-driving.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="090421113000058"></a>We propose to support responsible road use by improving driver training and testing, through the highly successful THINK!<I></I>campaign<I></I>and through development of a seamless suite of educational materials from pre-school to pre-driver, the first phase of which will be published later this week. Significant new effort will also go into improving driving skills and standards.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="090421113000059"></a>Despite improvement in 2007, the number of collisions involving 18 to 24 year-olds and newly qualified drivers remains unacceptably high. Tackling this issue remains a priority within our proposed new strategy, and we are also today announcing a programme of measures that will strengthen the way that people learn to drive and are tested, and create a culture of continued and lifelong learning.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="090421113000060"></a>The Driving Standards Agency&#146;s <I>Learning to Drive</I> Consultation Paper prompted almost 7,000 responses. The responses, many of which were from young people, confirm general support for our view that education and incentivisation<b></b>through improved training and testing is the best way to improve the safety of newly-qualified drivers.  As well as recognising that the great majority of people want to be law abiding and safe, such an approach also acknowledges that people learn to drive for many reasons, including to access education and employment.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="090421113000061"></a>Newly qualified drivers have told us that the current regime does not properly prepare them for driving unsupervised.<b></b>The programme of measures will ensure that they are better equipped to drive safely and responsibly in modern driving conditions. They will also introduce a more efficient and effective learning process, and give employers and insurers greater confidence in the driving abilities of newly qualified drivers and those who have invested in further training.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="090421113000062"></a>The changes will be delivered through a phased implementation programme, which supports progressive improvements while avoiding disruption to those currently learning to drive. The first phase aims to deliver, over the next two years, an improved learning process, improved theory and practical driving tests, and further options for learning and qualifications.</p>

<a name="90421-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="090421113000063"></a>Full details are set out in <I>Learning to Drive: Report on Consultation</I>, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. The consultation on the new road safety strategy closes on 14 July 2009. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of the House and are also available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office.</p>

The understanding from our US colleagues is that these individuals have been sentenced for charges related to murder, terrorism, insurgency and kidnapping. The UK is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances and works proactively with EU partners for its abolition around the world. Since autumn 2007 there have been no reports of any executions being carried out by the Government of Iraq. Our embassy in Baghdad has requested a call on the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights and will seek to raise this issue with them.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_44"></a><a name="090421114000064"></a>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office remains in contact with vulnerable groups and organisations such as the UK-based Iraqi lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender group. We are aware of some media reports of violence committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation. Homosexuality is a culturally sensitive issue in Iraq, as in much of the Middle East. In Iraq, the legal position is unclear. The law appears to criminalise homosexual acts with individuals under the age of 18. We are seeking to clarify whether homosexuality is criminalised per se. The UK continues to press the Government of Iraq and members of the Iraqi council of representatives to protect all of Iraq's communities, regardless of faith, political persuasion and sexual orientation and to take tough action against those responsible for violence and intimidation.</p>

As noted in CONTEST, we assess that most material of concern is hosted overseas.</p>

The number of overall cases has reached 94,000, with over 4,100 deaths. Working with international partners, the Department for International Development (DfID) has made available a &#163;10 million support package of direct responses to the epidemic itself and to boost essential medicine and supplies to help keep people alive through the worst of the crisis. The numbers of new cholera cases is now dropping sharply and the worst of the outbreak appears to be over. We continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_87"></a><a name="090421114000121"></a>The cholera outbreak and the dire humanitarian situation is a result of the chronic failure of social and economic policy. Only a long-term and systematic programme of reform will now begin truly to improve conditions for the people of Zimbabwe. We hope the new Government will provide this. We and the international community stand ready to support with development assistance when we see evidence of a commitment to economic and social reform and to the welfare of the population as a whole. In the mean time, we will continue to provide humanitarian and other essential help. Recent reports from the United Nations suggest that there is no substantial government obstruction to the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p>
