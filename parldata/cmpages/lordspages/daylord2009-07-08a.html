The <I>Code</I><I>s</I><I> of </I><I>Fundraising </I><I>Practice </I>outlaws members from using direct mail enclosures, such as coins, that generate a guilt response. If self-regulation should fail, the Charities Act 2006 contains a reserve power for government to intervene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09070884000005"></a><b>Baroness Crawley:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her kind welcome. I will try to be short on both counts. Would it be legal for her to send cash through the post with a begging letter? I would not advise her to do it, but it would not be illegal. I know that the noble Baroness is a national treasure, but she is not a national charity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09070884000006"></a>The noble Baroness is right on her second point: the clock is ticking for self-regulation on these annoying practices.

The practice of sending gifts or coins through the post is supposed to get a guilt response from people. It is a very annoying and frustrating way of going about building up a good name, as well as funds, for a charity. The commission, the Institute of Fundraising and the Fundraising Standards Board are all against it.</p>

However, does she agree that many charities see the downturn as presenting them with opportunities; for example, some charities in the social enterprise sector and those which require more volunteers as, for all sorts of reasons, more people are available to do that work?</p>

Charities that offer services such as information and advice to vulnerable communities on employment and employability and health and well-being services would all benefit from having more volunteers.</p>

What is being done to encourage some of the small charities to consider merging when they are competing for funds, often in a very small pool in a small area where it is not cost-effective to have multiple charities operating?</p>

The Charity Commission&#146;s polling of charities&#146; response to the downturn shows that only 6 per cent of UK charities polled&#151;I think 1,000 charities were polled&#151;said that they would consider a merger and collaboration. However, I will certainly get back to the noble Baroness on that.</p>

Is it still intended to pursue that possibility following the earlier pilot scheme? Meanwhile, can my noble friend assure the House that the officials responsible for the acceptance of the new scheme, which is so important for the enhancement of our public collections, will be enabled to stay closely in touch with the art market in London?</p>

On the earlier points, I can confirm that Birmingham is a short distance from London. Of course, things will be effected more efficiently if we moved into the electronic age. The cost is &#163;750,000, which is not a negligible cost. The suggestion from the MLA is that those who benefit from the process could usefully make a contribution to that and the suggestion has been made that it might look at this matter. Those discussions will continue. The Government are not prepared&#151;nor is the board prepared from its budget&#151;to sustain the full costs of going electronic. Meanwhile, I emphasise that the turnaround on licences is very rapid and very efficient. Some licences will continue to be issued, and requests responded to, on the same day.</p>

I understand that, at the moment, almost all of these documents are handled and turned around within five days&#151;and a very high proportion of them within 24 hours. Is the Minister satisfied that that will continue to be achieved when the move to Birmingham is made?</p>

I think the outstanding anxiety is where those licences are required within 24 hours&#151;the same day&#151;and this is the case in fewer than 1 per cent of cases. In those exceptional cases, it is anticipated that the office in Birmingham will be able to offer a service&#151;while certainly a few hours longer than one based in London under any courier system&#151;which will cope with same-day issuing.</p>

Also, costs will be reduced in the longer term. I have merely identified in the &#163;750,000 the one obvious and straightforward way in which the service could be made even more efficient than it is&#151;although it is highly efficient and is a source of very little in the way of criticism. It could be made more efficient with this extra deployment of resources, but the House might think it fair that the art industry and those concerned with this exercise, as well as the public purse, should make their contribution.</p>

Many of us have feared that in the Doha round there is a real risk of trade being put on to the second tier of global preoccupations, after international finance, regulatory changes to the banking system and climate change negotiations. All those things are important, but trade remains absolutely central to the growth of the global economy. A successfully negotiated world trade round would deliver a boost of something in the region of $150 billion a year to the global economy.

The proximate reasons why the ministerial talks failed last year were that India wanted higher, more special safeguards for its agriculture and the United States wanted lower protection for both agriculture and industrial goods among developing countries. There is plenty of room and scope for those positions to converge and for agreement to be found between the two. Since then, of course, the make-up of both the Indian and American Governments has changed, which presents an important opportunity to take forward what has already been agreed and to resolve the outstanding issues. The British Government will use every opportunity, international and otherwise, to encourage the parties to do exactly that.</p>

Does he not think that, if that were pursued, it would drive a coach and horses through any chance of getting the Doha round resumed and that it is, in fact, the latest tool to come out of the protectionist toolbox?</p>

Very strong marching orders should be given by heads of government to Trade Ministers to resume their ministerial negotiations at the earliest opportunity and to concentrate their minds on securing full agreement to the world trade round by 2010.

The paper <I>Re</I><I>forming </I><I>F</I><I>inancial </I><I>M</I><I>arkets</I>, published today by the Treasury, introduces a more formal and transparent structure for the three authorities by establishing a statutory council for financial stability chaired by the Chancellor, which will analyse and examine emerging risks to the financial stability of the UK&#146;s economy and co-ordinate the authorities&#146; response.</p>

<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="09070884000050"></a><b><a name="90708-0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070884000345"></a>Lord Barnett:</b> My Lords, will my noble friend thank our right honourable friend the Chancellor for kindly making his Statement in advance of my Question? That was very helpful. However, it needs a lot of clarity and I hope that we will debate it before too long. Does my noble friend agree that although the Statement confirms that the Governor of the Bank of England is basically the head of a quango, albeit an important one, he is not responsible for policy, which is for the Chancellor, and now he will no longer be responsible for regulation, which will be for the FSA? On the other hand, does my noble friend agree with the governor&#146;s statement that if banks are,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000265"></a>&#147;too big to fail, then ... they are too big&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000231"></a>I gather from the Statement&#151;a very lengthy one&#151;that he disagrees. In that case, does he accept that banks, either big or small, are not too big to fail?</p>

<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="09070884000051"></a><b><a name="90708-0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070884000346"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I recall the time when my noble friend was a mighty force in the Treasury. He seems to have demonstrated that force today by getting the Chancellor to produce the Statement today and to answer in such a constructive way the points which he is seeking to make. The answer to his question is obvious. We have learnt from the financial crisis that difficulties and threats to the British economy can occur as a result of large institutions and indeed of not-so-large institutions. The House will recall Northern Rock, which is certainly not one of our largest banks. Consequently the issue of size is not necessarily the crucial one. What is at stake is whether the failure of any financial institution poses a threat to the stability of the financial system. That is what the new machinery is designed to ensure does not happen.</p>

<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="09070884000052"></a><b><a name="90708-0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070884000347"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, will this council for financial stability not serve to diffuse authority within the banking system away from the three bodies that the Minister referred to, when we really want concentration in the banking sector?</p>

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="09070884000053"></a><b><a name="90708-0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070884000348"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I do not think that it will do that at all. What it will do is make the co-ordinating mechanism which exists between these three authorities open and transparent; and of course the Chancellor, in chairing it, is directly accountable to Parliament for decisions taken. In that respect I would have thought that the House would have appreciated that this is an advancement of openness, clarity and confidence about the way in which the three institutions will work together to promote financial stability.</p>

It looks absolutely first-class, and of course I agree with my noble friend Lord Barnett that the sooner we debate it, the better. However, I hope that my noble friend can answer the one question that still seems not to be fully answered. Am I right in thinking that when it comes to deciding whether to use taxpayers&#146; money to bail out a bank that has taken undue risks, the decision will absolutely be taken by the Chancellor and no one else?</p>

<p><a name="st_50"></a>

<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="09070884000056"></a><b><a name="90708-0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09070884000351"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. Clearly, the buck must stop with the Chancellor. He claimed in his Statement today that he was supporting better corporate governance and strengthening regulation, and that he wants to penalise banks whose pay policies create unnecessary risk and focus on short-term profit. So why did he wave through Mr Hester&#146;s &#163;10 million bonus package, which depends entirely on the performance of the share price over the past few years? Taxpayers own the bank through UKFI, so why is he washing his hands when he has the power to stop this scandal?</p>

We all recognise the challenge. I repeat that the last time we had a financial crisis of these dimensions, it took advanced countries close to a decade to recover, yet we are judging the efficacy of the Government&#146;s activities in a matter of months after the crisis first occurred. That may be a measure of the success of the actions taken.</p>

Parliament and politics face a huge task in seeking to dispel public disgust and public anger with our politics and politicians and instead to replace it with public trust and public confidence. The legislation before this House today is a vital step in that endeavour.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_674"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 674</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09070884000060"></a>I shall touch, first, on one procedural issue. On 30 June, my noble friend the Chief Whip proposed to the House a timetable for consideration of the Bill with the aim of achieving Royal Assent by the time the House rises for the Summer Recess. The noble Lord, Lord Norton, has since tabled an amendment to the committal Motion, which will be considered after Second Reading. In order to allow the House the opportunity to take a view on the timetable in response to that Motion, last night I withdrew from the Order Paper the Motion I had tabled, which would have allowed the House to take Report and Third Reading on 20 July. If appropriate, I shall retable my Motion at a later date.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09070884000061"></a>Before I begin to address the issues in and around the Bill, I want first to deal with three specific points: this House and what this House has done to tackle its own difficult issues this year; the relationship of the Bill, and its provisions and implications, to this House; and the responsibility that we as Members both of this House and of Parliament more generally have towards this proposed legislation.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09070884000062"></a>First, the Bill deals wholly and solely with the House of Commons. The reason for that is the public&#146;s anger&#151;entirely justified, entirely understandable and entirely right&#151;over the expenses scandal in the House of Commons. Most MPs are decent, hard-working men and women who strive for their constituents and do an excellent job. However, all MPs and many of their families have been tarnished by the expenses scandal, and that is why we need to work, and work hard, to put it right. I want to do everything possible to do that.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09070884000063"></a>Although the scandal is primarily a Commons scandal, we in this House have had our own difficulties. We have had to take the serious and significant step of suspending Members of this House for the first time in 400 years. We have been subject to a degree of media scrutiny of our own system of allowances&#151;not on the scale of that undergone by MPs but, none the less, unquestionably difficult enough. As do the Commons, we feel the dark shadow of investigations into Members of this House by the police&#151;no doubt legitimate and necessary investigations but, again, difficult none the less. If this has been an appalling period for the Commons&#151;and it has&#151;then it has been a tough period for this House too. I believe that we can say that we have addressed our own problems ourselves and have tried to do so in good order.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09070884000064"></a>The inquiry, which we established at our own instigation and concluded, into the events which led to the suspensions was thorough, rigorous and scrupulously fair. Arising from that incident, again at our own instigation, we have senior and serious Members of this House considering the issues for the rules and code of conduct of this House. At our own instigation and in the light of media scrutiny of our own allowances, the independent Senior Salaries Review Body is examining the question of financial support for Members of this House.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09070884000065"></a>If there are abuses in this House, this House is rooting them out and, if there are wrongs, this House is righting them. This House is putting this House in order. In line with that, this Bill contains no provisions, no measures and no proposals at all for this House.  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_675"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Nothing in this Bill will affect this House. Nothing in this Bill will impact upon this House. Nothing in this Bill will change what we in this House do and how we in this House do it.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09070884000066"></a>In spite of that, I recognise that there are two issues which we need to address: the constitutional and related issues&#151;issues for the Commons, but for this House too and for Parliament more generally&#151;which a number of Members of this House believe are raised by the Bill, and the future applicability of the Bill, its approach and provisions to this House. I will deal with the constitutional and related issues when I deal later with a range of reports on this Bill by a number of committees of this House and the other place. I need to deal with the future applicability of the Bill to this House.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09070884000067"></a>I know that a number of Members of this House have expressed concern at statements by Ministers about the Government&#146;s declared intention that they intended, in due course, to extend the provisions of the Bill to this House. Indeed, I gave some of those statements myself. But we also said that we would listen and consult extensively. We have done so. We have listened. For this House is not the House of Commons; it is a different place, a separate place, a place with its own, different, and separate ways of doing things. It is a place in which self-regulation means something different&#151;genuinely and materially different&#151;from what it means in the Commons. In relation to this Bill, the Government have recognised that from the first.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09070884000068"></a>When the proposals now in this Bill were first advanced, No 10 said in a document from the Prime Minister&#146;s Office on 19 May that the Government accepted the difference in self-regulation in this House, and in this Chamber, on 20 May, I repeated a Statement made in the other place by my right honourable friend the Leader of the House of Commons which stated that we,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000266"></a>&#147;recognise that the principle of self-regulation operates differently in the House of Lords&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/5/09; col. 1385.]</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000232"></a>I understand the concerns of Members of this House about this Bill or its approach being applied to this House and I acknowledge those concerns.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09070884000069"></a>I can say two specific things today. First, this Bill, whose current and only remit is for the House of Commons, will not apply to this House. Secondly, this Bill will not be extended in the future to this House as currently constituted. But, thirdly, just because this Bill does not and will not apply to the House of Lords, it does not mean that this House has nothing to do with this Bill. This House does have business with this Bill because this House has a responsibility to this legislation.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09070884000070"></a>The Commons has passed this legislation. The Commons believes it needs this legislation. That is explicit in the approval that the Commons has given to it. The Commons has amended this legislation to the point where the Commons is satisfied with it and with what the legislation will do to the Commons. This is the Commons&#146; Bill; a Bill of the Commons, by the Commons and for the Commons; and I believe that the Commons should have it.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_676"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 676</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09070884000071"></a>I am aware of the argument put by some Members of this House, with their own views of what constitutes a strong sense of parliamentary duty, that they see it as an obligation on them to save the Commons from itself. I understand those arguments and I respect those arguments, but I believe that they are misplaced. Although this House has a clear responsibility, it is a responsibility to let the Commons have the Bill that the Commons wants for the Commons.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09070884000072"></a>That is the responsibility of this House in dealing with the Bill. I look for this House to discharge the responsibility that it has before it.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09070884000073"></a>I now turn specifically to the Bill itself. The argument for the Bill, in what it is proposing for the Commons, is clear. The fundamental purpose of the Bill is to replace the self-regulation of expenses, allowances and financial interests with a system of independent, transparent and robust regulation.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09070884000074"></a>Public confidence in the Commons&#151;and, indeed, the whole of Parliament&#151;has been shaken by the expenses crisis. Although the issue has now fallen from the headlines, we are mistaken if any of us believe that this episode has been forgotten or forgiven by the public. We have a duty in this House to help the Commons implement a new system that can restore public confidence in the propriety of MPs and the process that governs their expenses and financial interests.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09070884000075"></a>That restoration of confidence cannot happen soon enough. There is agreement between the leaders of the parties that that is essential. All party leaders in the Commons agreed on the need for an independent authority for the setting, administration and adjudication of allowances. The Commons passed the Bill now before us unopposed at Third Reading. It has benefited from scrutiny and amendment in the Commons. Our aim is to create a system in which the public and Members of the other place can have full confidence. Key to the package of measures that we have brought forward in this Bill has been the guiding principle that we should deliver an independent, transparent and accountable system for handling expenses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09070884000076"></a>The Bill establishes an Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and a separate Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations. The authority will have three very important functions. It will set the system of MPs&#146; allowances independently of Parliament. It will administer the payment of those allowances according to clear rules. It will set and administer the MPs&#146; code of conduct on financial interests. All three of these functions will be taken out of Parliament and made transparent and independent. The commissioner will investigate complaints about breaches of the rules on allowances or financial interests. He or she will be independent and transparent, working outside Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09070884000077"></a>Let me now deal in more detail with the structure of the Bill. Clause 1 provides for the creation of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, the IPSA, and a separate Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will have the power to set a system of allowances and expenses for MPs without requiring parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09070884000078"></a>Schedule 1 to the Bill supplements Clause 1 and makes provision for the membership, administration and funding of the IPSA. The IPSA will be made up of four members and a chair. To ensure that the IPSA is lead by people with the appropriate breadth of skills and experience, the Bill provides that one of the five members must be a person who has held, but no longer holds, high judicial office; one must be qualified to be an auditor for the National Audit Office; and one must have been, but no longer be, a Member of the House of Commons. There is no bar on Members of the House of Lords being members of the authority.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09070884000079"></a>With the exception of the parliamentary member, a person who has been a Member of the House of Commons at any time within the past five years may not be a member of the IPSA. It is important that the IPSA should have some understanding of the way that Parliament works, but it is equally important that we can demonstrate to the public that it is truly independent. The proposed membership will deliver that balance.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09070884000080"></a>Selection to the authority will be on merit and by fair and open competition. A candidate for appointment as the chair or as a member will be selected by a panel, under the aegis of the Speaker of the House of Commons, with the agreement of the Speaker&#146;s Committee, which is to be established by the Bill. The appointments will be approved by an Address of the House of Commons and made by Her Majesty. Provisions for the terms of office for the chair and ordinary members of the IPSA are set out in paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 and they will be for a fixed term, which will not exceed five years. Both may be reappointed only once for a further term not exceeding three years. The IPSA, its members and staff will not be regarded as servants of the Crown and its annual report will be laid before each House of Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09070884000081"></a>The independence of the IPSA is further enhanced by paragraph 5 of Schedule 1, which provides that its members can be dismissed only in response to an Address from both Houses of Parliament. We are there as a safeguard for the independence of the process&#151;a vital role in making clear to the public that the IPSA is not beholden to the other place, that its perceived independence is a real, substantial independence.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09070884000082"></a>Schedules 1 and 2 extend the Freedom of Information Act to cover the IPSA and commissioner respectively. This means, among other things, that both bodies will be obliged to publish a publication scheme, approved by the Information Commissioner, setting out what information they will make available to the public without an FOI request being needed.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09070884000083"></a>I have already referred to the Speaker&#146;s Committee for the IPSA, which will be established by the Bill. Schedules 1 and 2 provide that it will approve the selection of candidates for appointment as a member of the IPSA or as the commissioner. In addition to giving the committee certain functions, the Bill sets out the membership of the Speaker&#146;s Committee which will comprise: the Speaker of the House of Commons; the Leader of the House of Commons; the chair of the House of Commons&#146; Committee on Standards and Privileges; and five MPs who are not Ministers of the Crown, appointed by the House of Commons.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_678"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09070884000084"></a>Clause 2 provides that the IPSA is to take over responsibility for paying the salaries of MPs in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the House. However, it will have no role under this Bill in setting the level of salaries. A new procedure for this has been set recently, with the level of salary increase being recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body on the basis of a basket of relevant public sector pay settlements. That procedure will continue unchanged.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09070884000085"></a>Clause 3 provides that the IPSA will be responsible for preparing and administering a new MPs&#146; allowances scheme and that this should be reviewed on a regular basis. The measures in the Bill will in no way pre-empt the work currently being undertaken by the Committee for Standards in Public Life to review MPs&#146; allowances. Indeed, the Bill simply lays the framework for a system of independent regulation, and we expect that the IPSA will draw on the outcome of the committee&#146;s work when devising an allowances scheme for MPs. Clause 3(7) lays out certain matters that the IPSA may include in the scheme, such as specifying the kinds of expenditure or the limits on the amounts to be paid. The allowances scheme will be laid before the House of Commons and published. However, it is essential to the credibility of the scheme that the other place should not be able to amend it, and therefore the scheme will come into effect without the need for parliamentary approval. There will however be a requirement on the IPSA to consult widely when devising the scheme and Clause 3(4) lists those who the IPSA must consult, including any other person the IPSA considers appropriate.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09070884000086"></a>To ensure that we lay the foundations for a robust and transparent system, Clause 4 provides that the IPSA will also take over responsibility for authorising and making payments under the allowances scheme.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09070884000087"></a>Clause 5 places a duty on the IPSA to prepare an MPs&#146; code of conduct relating to financial interests. The code will be prepared and revised by the IPSA in wide consultation, and must be reviewed regularly by the authority. The Speaker must lay the code before the House of Commons, and no such code can come into force unless approved by a resolution of the other place. The Bill requires that the code of conduct relating to financial interests must prohibit paid advocacy and must require registration of interests. It will not cover declaration of interests, which will remain a matter for internal regulation by the other House.</p>

<a name="90708-0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09070884000088"></a>Clause 6 sets out the investigatory powers for the Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations. This will allow the commissioner to initiate an investigation where there is reason to believe that an MP may have been paid an allowance to which he or she was not entitled, or may have failed to comply with MPs&#146; code of conduct relating to financial interests. A significant element of these provisions is subsection (6), which requires the IPSA to determine procedures in relation to the handling of investigations, complaints and the publication of reports following investigations. Clearly, Members in another place will want to be assured that any investigations or complaints will be handled according to appropriate standards of fairness. To begin to address these legitimate concerns, Clause 6(8) makes particular requirements on these procedures to exemplify how standards of fairness must be upheld.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09070884000089"></a>An additional safeguard is that the judicial member of the IPSA will have a hand in agreeing the investigation, complaint and publication handling procedures. The IPSA will also need to act in setting these procedures in a way that is compatible with the Human Rights Act. This means that courts will be able to review the exercise of functions of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority on the basis of the ordinary principles of administrative and human rights law.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09070884000090"></a>Clause 7 includes a number of sanction powers so that the IPSA may direct those who have received allowances to which they were not entitled to repay them. In addition, the IPSA will be able to direct an MP to amend his or her entries in the register of financial interests. Where appropriate, the IPSA will also be able to recommend to the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges that the House takes disciplinary action against a Member who has broken the rules. It will be up to the committee whether it accepts, rejects or modifies such a recommendation. Such disciplinary action may include withholding a Member&#146;s pay, being suspended or even expulsion from the other place.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09070884000091"></a>It is important that we should note that these are powers that the House of Commons already has; the Bill does not confer them on the House. They are mentioned only as an indication of the matters on which the IPSA may recommend, not as an indication of the sanctions the House can impose. Moreover, the Bill does not prevent the House exercising any of its disciplinary powers otherwise than following an investigation by the commissioner or a recommendation by the IPSA. However, we are willing to consider further whether the commissioner should simply make a report on fact and refer rather than recommend this to the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09070884000092"></a>In addition to the enforcement powers for the ISPA and commissioner, Clause 8 of the Bill creates the following new criminal offences: of providing information that the Member knows is false or misleading in a claim for an allowance, for which the maximum sanction is up to 12 months&#146; custodial sentence or an unlimited fine; failing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the rules on registration of financial interests, for which the maximum penalty is a fine of up to &#163;5,000, and an offence prohibiting paid advocacy. There are precedents for such offences; I have made available in the Library a chart that shows a range of comparative offences.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09070884000093"></a>Clause 9 provides that the Speaker may agree with the IPSA that it shall take over certain registration functions currently carried out by the Standards Commissioner. It further provides that the Speaker may agree with the Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations that he or she shall take over other functions of the Standards Commissioner. Any such agreement would take place only after appropriate consultation with the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges; it would be laid before the House of Commons and be subject to approval by resolution of the other place.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09070884000094"></a>We must recognise that, already, there is a wide-ranging scheme on allowances and financial interests in the House of Commons. To manage the transition from  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_680"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 680</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the old system of allowances, Clause 11 sets out the powers to make transitional provision which may be exercised by a Minister of the Crown, for example the Leader of the House of Commons. This is to ensure that a valid system of rules relating to allowances and financial interests is in place as soon as possible after the IPSA has been established. I should emphasise, however, that the new rules on offences will apply only in relation to an allowances scheme or financial rules made by the IPSA. Moreover, the IPSA and the commissioner will not be able to exercise its functions under the Bill in relation to any matter arising under the old rules.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09070884000095"></a>Perhaps I might now turn to the thoughtful scrutiny that this Bill has received from several committees. The House of Lords Constitution Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the House of Commons Justice Committee have all published reports in the last week. First, let me address the reports from the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution. Its first report concludes that the committee is unconvinced that the case has been made for fast-tracking this Bill and that the policymaking has been rushed.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09070884000096"></a>This Bill is the result of constructive cross-party discussion, which included representatives from your Lordships&#146; House. Throughout the cross-party talks on this Bill, there has been a broad consensus that we must end the self-regulation of the House of Commons allowances schemes and the registration of financial interests. It is critical that the IPSA should be up and running as soon as possible for MPs currently in the Commons, but it is also crucial that it is established and properly embedded before the forthcoming general election, so that any new MPs elected at that time are not sullied by the problems of this Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09070884000097"></a>I am grateful to the Constitution Committee for its reports on this Bill. As members of the committee will know from the evidence that I gave to them, we agree on many issues, including expedited legislation. On that point, following a key recommendation of the committee, I undertake to ensure that in this House, any Minister seeking to bring forward fast-track legislation makes an early statement to the House when the legislation is introduced, setting out the case for expedition. On a second key recommendation, I believe that there should be a post-legislative review of the Parliamentary Standards Bill within two years. This would provide Parliament with an opportunity to review the impact and effectiveness of the legislation in the near future. On the committee&#146;s second report, published this lunchtime, we will study it and come back in Committee to the issues raised in it.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09070884000098"></a>I would also like to touch upon the key issues raised in the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The report suggested that the Bill may not be compatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 6 sets out a right to a fair and public hearing where there is to be a determination of a civil right or a criminal charge. The committee suggests that more procedural safeguards, such as the opportunity to call and examine witnesses, should be included in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09070884000099"></a>The report also concludes that there should be a right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council against determinations of the IPSA and the  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_681"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>House of Commons. The Government very much appreciate the work of the Joint Committee but we do not accept that the Bill as currently drafted is incompatible with Article 6. We will set out our reasons fully in due course. I should stress also our belief that nothing in the Bill as it currently stands is incompatible with Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09070884000100"></a>The Justice Committee report aired concerns about the infringement of parliamentary privilege. The Government have listened to its concerns about including a statutory requirement for there to continue to be a code of conduct incorporating the Nolan principles and we have removed this from the Bill. On its introduction, the Bill also included provisions that proceedings in Parliament may be admissible in a court in relation to the three new offences in proceedings against a Member. At the behest of the other place, this no longer forms part of the Bill. The removal of these clauses in no way undermines our key objective, which is to establish an independent and transparent system of regulation.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09070884000101"></a>In the light of this, and following further cross-party discussions&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="09070884000102"></a><b><a name="90708-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070884000355"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> My Lords, in relation to the work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the right honourable Jack Straw, in the Commons, indicated to Mr Dismore, the chair of the committee, that the Government were open minded about introducing fairness procedures. Is it the Government&#146;s intention to do that at Committee stage?</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09070884000104"></a>In the light of what I was saying, and following further cross-party discussions, we will be tabling an amendment to the Bill to remove the new offence on paid advocacy. We agree that this issue requires further consideration and we intend to return to it in the next legislative Session.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09070884000105"></a>In conclusion, the Bill, which is wholly and solely for the Commons, is necessary. It is an essential Bill; a Bill which the Commons wants; a Bill which the Commons needs; and a Bill which will bring about the changes in the Commons that the public of this country want to see. It is a Bill that does not apply to this House; a Bill which will not apply to this House. Nevertheless, it is a Bill towards which this House, as the second Chamber of our Parliament, has a clear responsibility. It is a Commons Bill and it is a Bill which this House must ensure that the Commons has. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

My past interests in this area have been as Leader of the House of Commons, chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee some 20 years ago, although much has changed since, and more recently as a Member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the committee that produced the report on the House of Lords.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_682"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 682</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09070884000107"></a>I wish to make four general points today. The first is this: there is no question but that there have been, it would appear, some serious abuses of the Commons allowances system, although it is easy to get an exaggerated view on how many&#151;but more on that later. It clearly needs to be attended to and I have no objection in principle to an independent body being responsible for it. However, that does not mean that we should give this Bill, which is the Prime Minister&#146;s answer to the abuses, swift approval. There are some serious and fundamental flaws in it, which anyone reading the paper by the Clerk of the House of Commons to the House of Commons Justice Committee, our own Constitution Committee report and the Joint Committee on Human Rights report would see in abundance. In particular, the first two are devastating in their criticisms. At Second Reading in the other place, Alan Duncan referred to the Clerk&#146;s paper. He said that it had two central concerns, which were,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000267"></a>&#147;first, that swathes of the Bill are or would have been justiciable and would set Parliament&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000233"></a>&#147;Parliament&#148;, not only the House of Commons&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000268"></a>&#147;on a direct collision course with the courts; and, secondly, that this could undermine the basic principles of free speech in this House&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/6/09; col. 66.]</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000234"></a>Those are devastating criticisms.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09070884000108"></a>My first point therefore is that the handling of this matter is little short of disgraceful. It bears all the hallmarks of a knee-jerk response by a beleaguered Prime Minister in a bunker making legislation on the hoof in response to newspaper headlines and announcing his quick thought for the day on YouTube. It flies in the face of all the Government&#146;s own rules for public consultation&#151;I stress public consultation, as distinct from secret cross-party talks&#151;and adequate time for scrutiny of legislation. It raises serious constitutional issues as a result of the thoughtless haste with which the Government did the drafting. We see evidence of that in the continuing response by the Government in making changes and even promising some&#151;if I heard it right&#151;in the next Parliament. In all my time in Parliament, I have never seen such a critical report by a clerk in the House of Commons. I say to the Leader that my criticism does not include her role. I have great sympathy for her and I am grateful for the assurances that she fought for and gave today.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09070884000109"></a>Admittedly, in the House of Commons, Clause 6 was withdrawn and Clause 10 was defeated, albeit by a majority of three. These clauses were highly objectionable on constitutional grounds but, as the report of the Constitution Committee makes clear, much still needs to be done on what are now Clauses 6, 7 and 8. I leave it to my noble friend Lord Goodlad to talk about his Constitution Committee report, but I quote one sentence from it:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09070884000250"></a>&#147;This is no way in which to legislate on matters which raise complex constitutional and legal issues&#148;.</p>

We should not have done that. We should have stopped it in the Commons and said no.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09070884000112"></a>We in this House are left to pick up and sort out the pieces. I believe that, contrary to the implication that the Leader gave, there are many in the other place who expect us to do just that. Indeed, some have said that to me. This raises the question of timing, about which my noble friend Lord Norton has tabled an amendment to the Motion&#151;I wait to hear what he has to say. If we do not go down that route, there are other ways of giving this House more time, such as extra days or postponing other business to the spillover. Whatever it is, we must find some way or other of ensuring that we give this Bill enough time for the proper scrutiny to take place. That includes the question of a sunset clause for further considered thoughts in the next Parliament. We have to bear in mind that the other House passed this legislation in three days with no Third Reading.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09070884000113"></a>My second point relates to the fact that, although this Bill relates only to the House of Commons, there are, as all three reports to which I referred confirm, major constitutional implications in the Bill relating to the Bill of Rights, parliamentary supremacy, the relations between Parliament and the courts, judicial review and human rights. I leave it to others in this debate more qualified than I am to talk on these issues.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09070884000114"></a>In passing, I observe on human rights that one of the most disgraceful aspects of this whole episode has been the way in which what is effectively a kangaroo court of three people, with no proper right of hearing or appeal, has been allowed to cause one or two Members of the other place to retire from Parliament because they were not able to stand again. I refer in particular to the case of Ian Gibson, the former Member for Norwich North. I come from that area. Although I disagree profoundly with him on many political issues, I thought that the way in which he was treated was utterly disgraceful and should not have been allowed. I know that that feeling is widely shared in the whole community and in all parties in Norfolk. In my judgment, there will have to be much debate and significant amendments on all these counts before this Bill is allowed to pass.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09070884000115"></a>Again, as Alan Duncan said at Second Reading,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000269"></a>&#147;if we get it wrong it could have a devastating effect on our democratic process and our procedures, which could seriously disadvantage the interests of voters&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/6/09; col. 58.]</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000235"></a>So this Bill is not just about internal matters of the House of Commons; there are much wider parliamentary issues at stake. Since the House of Commons gave such little time to it, it behoves us to give much more.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09070884000116"></a>My third point relates to outside interests. There is a curious paradox in that there is much complaint nowadays that too many MPs have never had experience outside the narrow channels of going from university to politics, being a research assistant, then a special adviser, then a Member of the House and then, just possibly, a Minister. Now measures are being introduced  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_684"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 684</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to curtail and hugely discourage outside interests. Shortly after I left the Cabinet, I had to give what was almost the first piece of evidence in the first session of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I made a plea to it, and delivered a paper, on the importance of allowing Members of Parliament to continue with outside interests to enable them to bring the proper experience and judgment to the House of Commons. I am glad to say that that committee, which was under pressure to recommend against outside interests, strongly agreed with me.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09070884000117"></a>I know that having outside interests hugely helped me in my parliamentary career and I do not believe that it is to the detriment of what MPs do in their role as Members of Parliament or in their constituency. It means a heavy workload, but it brings huge advantages to the House. Let us not forget that Ministers, who have an even bigger role than many of those with outside interests, also have their constituency and parliamentary interests as well. So there is one law for Ministers and another for everyone else.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09070884000118"></a>This Bill&#151;and even the petty timekeeping that will now be required to have an outside interest&#151;will mean a continuation of the trend of stopping outside interests, which will mean the demeaning of Parliament and reinforce the very trend that so many criticise of a House dominated by people with no outside experience. In my view, it is not necessary to include outside interests in the Bill, as the Standards and Privileges Committee in the House of Commons has been doing a good job in the area of the register, the code of conduct and breaches. I am not aware of criticism of the committee, whose chairman I pay tribute to&#151;he has done a terrific job&#151;along with the parliamentary committee itself. The committee should have been left to deal with all of that.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09070884000119"></a>I come to a point that takes me outside the Bill but that worries me most. I know that what I am about to say will be unpopular in some quarters, but I believe that it needs saying. Of course, there have been serious abuses that need to be tackled but, in the media witch-hunt that is taking place, the fact that most MPs are highly honourable is being overlooked. They have to have second homes if they are to undertake their constituency activities and have time even to see their families. They are immensely hard-working and commit themselves to public service, their constituents and the great issues of the nation, often at some considerable financial sacrifice. I do not think that most people realise, unless they have been in it, how time-consuming the whole business is. The commitment is enormous.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09070884000120"></a>The unpalatable fact&#151;and perhaps I will be unpopular for saying it, but it needs saying&#151;is that one reason why allowances have got out of kilter and sometimes been misused is that salaries have gone way out of line for the kind of people whom we should be trying to attract to Parliament. Of course, there will always be people who will stand for Parliament, but it is people of talent and experience whom we need to attract. After all, it is the greatest institution in the nation. Ministers are drawn primarily from it and in their roles in all sorts of ways they have much greater responsibility and impact on people, the nation&#146;s affairs and internationally than do those in many other roles outside Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09070884000121"></a>When I left the Cabinet and rejoined some companies, I simply had not realised the extent to which salaries had fallen behind in the House of Commons, compared with the kind of salaries&#151;and pensions&#151;that I saw offered even in middle-ranking positions in not very big companies. The whole thing has got completely out of kilter. Indeed, many people in public sector jobs in local authorities are paid greatly more than Members of Parliament, who are supposed to have the responsibility over them. Most people know that there are recently qualified lawyers in their mid-20s, with perhaps only one or two years&#146; experience, who are earning as much as Members of Parliament and who expect to go on earning hugely more. That also applies to other professions.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09070884000122"></a>Being a Member of Parliament should be one of the most important and worthwhile careers, but I am concerned about everything that is now happening to many good and worthy MPs and the unfair vilification of them, on top of outdated salaries. I realise that in the current crunch this is not the moment to raise salaries, but that issue has to be addressed in the future. My concern is that, unless we put these things right, it will be very difficult to attract the sort of talents that we want in the House and to stand for Parliament, which would be a tragedy.</p>

The need for it is self-evident in the harm that has been done to the body politic in the past two or three months. I am mindful, as many noble Lords will be, of the agreement involved. Not only the Prime Minister, but the three party leaders in the Commons, believe it is important for a Bill of this nature to be brought here. I agree that we have to be flexible with the timetable. If more days are required for Committee stage&#151;it will depend on the number of amendments tabled&#151;further time will have to be provided.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09070884000124"></a>This is a short Bill and it seems to be getting shorter in terms of what is before us. It has been an interesting experience for me as one who has been invited for what one might call informal pre-legislative scrutiny with the Lord Chancellor, the right honourable Jack Straw MP, representatives of all the parties in the Commons, including the nationalist parties and the Northern Ireland parties, and Cross-Benchers from this House. There have been at least five meetings, and the Bill changed in many ways before it became the one now published. The Bill is to create this thing called IPSA to create and run an expenses regime and pay salaries, to investigate alleged wrongdoing and deal with the consequences. My noble friends Lord Goodhart and Lord Lester of Herne Hill will have more to say on such matters.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09070884000125"></a>We have also been informed that the Bill does not affect this House, and the noble Baroness reiterated that point. One way of making that clear would be to re-name the authority the IHOCSA or the Independent House of Commons Standards Authority. The aim is to get MPs out of fixing salaries and expenses; yet Parliament is supreme. However if, through this regime, expenses became too much or were perceived as too little, I doubt that IPSA would last that long.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_686"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 686</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09070884000126"></a>I also want to mention the relationship between the various bodies that are looking at these matters. The Bill creates IPSA for the moment, which will look at the expenses regime and then pay those expenses, but we have Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s report to come, and then there is the SSRB. I am far from clear about the inter-relationships there. It could be, as the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, indicated, that there is a greater relationship between these matters; particularly the salaries issue where, in certain circumstances, expenses seem to have been embraced as an addition to salary. Perhaps that should be put to one side and these things looked at in the round, and not separately.</p>

<a name="90708-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09070884000127"></a>Reference has already been made to a sunset clause. There is no doubt about it: all those meetings have taken place; nevertheless, this is being done in a rush. Is it right? If there is a sunset clause and this Bill lasts a couple of years, it would be a good thing, particularly with post-legislative scrutiny. There are details in the Bill that need looking at. I am amazed that the Bill suggests that five people should become the IPSA and that those five can resolve themselves into a committee of&#151;I assume&#151;fewer than five. The committee can then resolve itself into a sub-committee, of fewer than fewer than five. It is strange that they cannot co-opt someone to serve on a sub-committee of a committee, when doing so may assist them on some element of benefit in kind, or something that they have no expertise in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09070884000128"></a>At the Second Reading of a Bill, there comes a point at this stage where people say, &#147;Well, I very much welcome this Bill and perhaps we can improve it in Committee&#148;, or, &#147;This is a Bill that I want to oppose at every turn&#148;. I think this Bill may well need very much amendment, but it is one of those Bills that I feel we will just have to put up with.</p>

I am pleased that further concessions have been made today by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall; this means that its size is to be yet further reduced. However, despite this, the Bill still raises issues of significant constitutional importance. Accordingly, while its contents may be primarily of concern to the other place, I would suggest that this House would be wrong to abdicate its responsibility to revise its contents, particularly in relation to constitutional matters.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09070884000130"></a>In so far as this has been possible in the time available, the Select Committee on the Constitution has given careful consideration to the Bill in its present form. Its views have been made known to the House by its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. I agree with the views of the committee and will try to avoid trespassing on what the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, will say about the views of the committee.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09070884000131"></a>There are issues that I would like to address, which are by no means exhaustive. First, the Bill is premature. Secondly, I raise the question of whether we need a new criminal offence that can be committed only by Members of the House of Commons, when there is  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_687"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 687</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already a perfectly good existing criminal offence which would be applicable and which gives greater powers of punishment than those in the Bill. Thirdly, is there a danger that the Bill will undermine the delicate relationship between Parliament and the courts? This has been carefully established by the courts in relation to not interfering with proceedings in Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09070884000132"></a>I have not the benefit of the great experience of the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, whose speech I endorse, but in addressing these issues I take into account my experience as chairman for a short time of the sub-committee on interests of Members of this House, the cases bearing on the relationship between Parliament and the courts that came before me when I sat as a judge, and the deliberations of the Select Committee on the Constitution.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09070884000133"></a>On the prematurity of the Bill, as I understand it a primary purpose of the Bill is to ensure that Members of the other place adopt the appropriate standards in making claims for the repayment of allowances. However, those standards have not yet been determined and are still under consideration. We still await the report of Sir Christopher Kelly. If you are still seeking to devise the appropriate standard, is it not unwise to introduce new methods of enforcing an as yet unidentified standard? Surely the method of enforcement should be tailored to meet the standard, not the other way round. The Bill curtails what the standard can be before it has been introduced and accepted by Parliament in that it assumes that it will be allowances based.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09070884000134"></a>Let me illustrate what I mean. A great many of the problems that have arisen over expenses are due to a lack of clarity about what can properly be claimed. It is my understanding that if clarity had been introduced into what Members in the other place were entitled to, many of the situations which have resulted in criticism would not have arisen. If that clarity could now be achieved, much of what is proposed in the Bill could be unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09070884000135"></a>To take an extreme example, if it was decided that instead of being an unquantified amount a set sum was payable irrespective of what had been expended, the problem, at least in relation to that allowance, would largely disappear. How much better it would be to wait until full consultation has taken place and then legislate than to take the present course, which involves determining the remedy before the true dimension of what is required is known.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09070884000136"></a>As regards the new criminal offence, it is always possible for dishonest persons to make claims to receive that to which they are not entitled. This can happen in many circumstances and criminal offences can be committed by all sections of society. This is certainly not a temptation confined to Members of the other place. The criminal law therefore makes full provision to ensure that those who commit offences of this nature can be convicted and duly punished. What is the purpose of creating this new offence, which I believe does not add to the existing law, by providing that a Member, who for the purposes of the allowances scheme,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000270"></a>&#147;provides information ... that the member knows to be false or misleading in a material respect&#148;?</ul>



<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_688"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 688</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09070884000236"></a>This is well trodden ground. The presence of the new offence will only create confusion and allow the unjustified point to be made that Members of the other place are being treated with undue preference; for example, because the punishment is less than those available against the ordinary citizen.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09070884000137"></a>On the courts and Parliament, recent constitutional changes have undermined certain of the constitutional safeguards which have benefited our society for generations. This Bill creates a danger of undermining at least one of those safeguards, which is that the courts should avoid pronouncing on matters affecting the internal affairs of either House of Parliament. So far, by the exercise of appropriate sensitivity the courts have avoided conflict with Parliament. This has proved to be a constitutional safeguard. It is difficult to conceive of any more damaging way of disturbing the delicate relationship between Parliament and the courts than the courts taking upon themselves a supervisory role in relation to the manner in which Members are to be compensated for expenses incurred in the performance of their parliamentary duties.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09070884000138"></a>The Bill introduces methods of investigating, policing and adjudicating upon the activities of Members of the other place by IPSA and the commissioner, which could well come before the courts if the Bill remains in its present form. The adjudications by IPSA, which the Bill involves, will have very serious consequences for the reputation of those Members&#151;albeit that they would not involve penalties of the sort imposed by the criminal courts. The Members who are proceeded against can reasonably expect to have the same rights as would be available to those who appear before ordinary disciplinary tribunals. The new bodies that are being created&#151;the commissioner and IPSA&#151;have many characteristics of a tribunal which is subject to judicial review.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09070884000139"></a>I note, however, what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, about no recommendations being made; I appreciate that that could improve the position. Despite that, this is still a very delicate situation. The fact that, at such a late stage, it was thought right to make that change indicates the danger to which I am referring.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09070884000140"></a>There is, therefore, a real risk that the system being introduced by the Bill will inadvertently make the activities of those bodies subject to review by the courts. The courts in this way will be drawn into adjudicating upon what has been happening in Parliament. Generally this is undesirable, but it is particularly undesirable because, in those proceedings, questions of parliamentary privilege could well arise. The danger of this happening should be avoided, unless there is no alternative. However, Clause 6(3) provides that, for the purposes of investigation, a Member of the other place must&#151;and I emphasise the word &#147;must&#148;&#151;provide the commissioner with any information he reasonably requires. I suggest that could be a recipe for conflict which could end in the courts. One way that the danger could be reduced&#151;</p>

Parliament could not be landed in a position where the courts were undermining the privilege of free speech, which is so important, in the Houses of Parliament. However, once you put a specific statutory obligation upon a Member of Parliament, as this Bill does, to provide information without limitation as to what information can reasonably be sought, that surely creates a different situation. It is that different situation to which I was seeking to draw attention.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09070884000143"></a>I was going to refer to the fact that perhaps an alternative way of dealing with the matter would be by giving an express right of appeal to the Member, instead of the Member relying upon judicial review. I note what has been said about the possibility of an appeal to the Privy Council&#151;an appeal which is now to be dealt with by our new Supreme Court. I am bound to ask: is that the right place for an appeal on a matter of this nature to go, bearing in mind that it is thought that the criminal offence would go before a magistrates&#146; court? You would get a ruling on evidence by the Privy Council in relation to proceedings which could take place in the magistrates&#146; court. The Supreme Court will have jurisdiction over the whole of the United Kingdom&#151;to that extent it is different from any other court&#151;but the Crown Court and magistrates&#146; court, at least in England and Wales, would seem more appropriate destinations for an appeal. However, for different reasons, each would be inappropriate destinations for matters with which the Bill is concerned.</p>

Does he agree that there is no objection to there being an internal independent appeal mechanism set up instead of the Privy Council, or that the Privy Council&#151;as it deals with appeals against members of the professions&#151;could do precisely the same if it were a disciplinary matter? In other words, there could be either an external body, which has the disadvantages that the noble and learned Lord indicated, or an independent and impartial tribunal set up within the House of Commons, presided over by a senior judge, that could deal with the matter in the way that the noble and learned Lord has indicated.</p>

It is the need to consider matters of that sort, to which I will not&#151;if the noble Lord will forgive me&#151;give a response immediately, that indicates why the course that has been taken in relation to this Bill was perhaps not the one that was needed. These are dangers which need very careful examination. After careful deliberation, a system needs to be made which stands the test of time.</p>

As the noble and learned Lord said, the maximum sentence under the Fraud Act for unlawful expense claims by MPs is 10 years&#146; imprisonment. Under the provisions of the present Bill, it is one year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09070884000154"></a>I have touched briefly on a fraction of the considerations rehearsed in the three Select Committee reports currently before your Lordships&#146; House.

I agree absolutely with all that has been said both by my noble friend Lord MacGregor and by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09070884000156"></a>We are faced with a serious situation, which has prompted&#151;although not in a very sensible way&#151;the preparation of serious measures in response to it. However, it is important to put them in perspective. I fear that, in the 20 years that have passed since I was Leader of the House of Commons, the morale of parliamentarians, Members of the other place, has declined steadily. We need to consider the impact of what is now being proposed on the long-term prospects for that.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09070884000157"></a>My recollection of the atmosphere in those days, when we had only just invented our first parliamentary standards commissioner and the Privileges Committee had greater freedom and greater self-confidence, is that the committee and its members were confident that if such a crisis had arisen, they would have been able to handle it. I had as my colleagues parliamentarians as diverse and emphatic as the late Lord Biffen and the by no means late Tony Benn. It was a traditional, confident body. I am anxious that what follows from this will try to restore that confidence as well as the standards.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09070884000158"></a>We have, in a way, been here already. I had forgotten until the other day that the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, had himself been charged, in April 2000, with making proposals for standards of conduct in this House. I wrote then a document for his consideration and this is what I said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09070884000251"></a>&#147;My central proposition is that the tide of oversight and regulation of Members of Parliament should now be seen as having already reached its high water mark. In the Commons indeed it has already become unduly intrusive and should now begin to recede&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070884000237"></a>I drew to his attention a quotation that I have overworked frequently. It is from Lord Moulton, the distinguished liberal Law Lord, in 1912:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09070884000252"></a>&#147;There are three great domains of human conduct. The first is where our actions are limited or forbidden by law. Then there is the domain of free personal choice. But between these two is a third domain, that in which there is neither law nor unfettered freedom. This is the domain of &#145;obedience to the unenforceable&#146;, where people do right although there is no one and nothing to make them do right but themselves&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09070884000159"></a>That was then a proposition understood. It has been a proposition on which many of our self-disciplines  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_692"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 692</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have been based. Indeed, it was the foundation of the determination of this House to be self-regulating without the need for external pressure. It is a perfectly respectable standard. That is why I was distressed when the Prime Minister, I think, began repudiating the notion of behaving on our own devices like a gentlemen&#146;s club. In fact the whole essence of self-regulation, if it is properly to work, is mutual respect in that way, and that is a way to which we should wish to return, if we can.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09070884000160"></a>I am not challenging the need now for tighter measures of the kind that we are discussing today. I am really saying that we need to try to get the balance right and restore the morale and self-confidence of Members of the other place, as we would here. I agree with those who have said that there has been a decline&#151;one must put it as crudely as this&#151;in the self-confidence of Members of the other place, alongside an enhancement in the narrow professionalisation of their political role. The other place now lacks the presence of people with wider experience in almost every occupation of which I can think. Nowhere is it more obvious and more critical than in the field of the law officers of the Crown. We have at the moment an Attorney-General in this House who is immensely competent and well qualified for the post. But in the days when I became Solicitor-General, and that is now some 30 years ago, I was one of probably half a dozen people competing for the job. At that time the House of Commons had a mass of people, not just in the law but in other professions, who were there with those qualifications, giving a spread of confidence and competence to the House.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09070884000161"></a>That has changed, and the prospect of entering Parliament at the present time is not very encouraging. We need to have a Parliament that is able once again to spread its confidence and its talent. That is why I feel that we must not only be careful in the adjustment and measurement of the measures that are necessarily now being taken but also ask ourselves whether there are not other ways in which Parliament has abdicated from areas where it once used to be responsible and behaving effectively in areas of need.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09070884000162"></a>The first example is the fact that we have now had in the Commons a sequence of four parliamentary commissioners for standards, all people of great integrity and all coming from a background wholly different from the one in which they have had to exercise their powers. One wonders whether we cannot get away from that contraction of the self-regulatory capacity of the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09070884000163"></a>Another example is the extent to which the Electoral Commission has taken over many functions that used to be determined by Speaker&#146;s Conferences. The first chairman of the Electoral Commission was a man for whom I had the greatest admiration as the director of the BBC World Service. However, his background and training, and that of his colleagues, were not the most appropriate to handle an area that had been taken away from the House of Commons. Speaker&#146;s Conferences are not all that ancient&#151;the first was held in 1916&#151;but they became more frequent after World War II, being held in 1944, 1965, 1973 and 1977. Parliament&#151;the House of Lords was also represented on Speaker&#146;s Conferences&#151;then played a part effectively and with  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_693"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>respect, but we have now sub-contracted that role to an organisation which, frankly, lands a whole range of ill considered propositions in front of us. Therefore, over the past decade or so the electoral system has gone through turmoil so fast that even I can hardly understand the ballot paper.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09070884000164"></a>Those are my two points: Parliament should set about reclaiming functions that it used to do well and we have to get the balance right, although we have to be very careful to ensure that we have a sufficiently tight means of preventing any further misbehaviour of the kind that has caused this problem. Just as my noble friend Lord MacGregor drew attention to the current under-financial reward for Members of the House of Commons, so we also have to ensure that the House itself is rewarding and welcoming, so that it can once again attract real people and not just narrowly qualified professional politicians to perform a job of huge importance. It is our function not only, as some people have said, to protect the House of Commons from itself but also to enable the House to regain some of the self-confidence that it used to enjoy&#151;I sound like a very old man indeed&#151;in the days when we were there.</p>

Despite the great range of expertise on the subject before us, we found on the Labour Benches that none of my noble friends, except my noble friend Lord Barnett, felt able to take part in this debate. Therefore, both I and my noble friend felt that we had no choice&#151;we had to take part.</p>

<a name="90708-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09070884000166"></a>I begin by thanking my noble friend the Leader of the House for her introduction to this debate and for her obvious desire to be conciliatory. As an example, I had thought that the Prime Minister had said in terms that the principles of the Bill would be applied to reform of the House of Lords when that took place. That, I must admit, frightened the life out of me, but I understand from my noble friend that that was based on a complete misinterpretation and that, when we come to reform, we are not going to be told, &#147;You accepted this for the Commons Bill; therefore, you have to accept it for the Lords Bill&#148;. I hope that, when she replies to the debate, my noble friend will reassure me that I did not misunderstand what she said and that we will not be confronted with that argument. If we are, my view is that we ought to throw this Bill out rather than amend it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09070884000169"></a>Given what has been going on in the other place, albeit by a minority of Members, as the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, has pointed out, the Government need to act and to introduce appropriate legislation as quickly as possible. I, for one, certainly support the Government in that. However, beyond that, if there had been deals in the other place between the Government and the Opposition so that the Bill passed there with a minimum of debate, that is their business. Of course, it becomes our business when it affects how we deal with the Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09070884000170"></a>There is a paradox. Recently your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee published a report on the fast-tracking of legislation, to which the Leader of your Lordships' House and the Deputy Leader of the other place gave excellent evidence. The paradox is that what they said then does not remotely match up to what is being done now and is in conflict with the Constitution Committee&#146;s report on that subject. What is being proposed makes it impossible for your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee to do the job assigned to it by your Lordships when the committee was set up. One can quote various paragraphs from the report but my favourite is the absolutely stark statement in paragraph 9:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09070884000253"></a>&#147;The way policy making has been rushed, the lack of public consultation and the limited opportunities given to Parliament to scrutinise the Bill all, in our view, fail to meet the minimum requirements of constitutional acceptability&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070884000239"></a>Nothing could be plainer than that and nothing can guide us more clearly to what is our duty.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09070884000171"></a>One would have thought that the Leader of the House would immediately have accepted the view of a major committee like the Constitution Committee, which has expressed its view in such a forthright way. We would have expected the usual channels&#151;I emphasise &#147;the usual channels&#148;&#151;to have assisted us but there has been complete silence from the usual channels, as far as I understand it, in accepting the peculiar set of accelerated arrangements that have come forward. Why are not the usual channels defending the way in which this House behaves? Your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee published a second report this afternoon and I commend it to your Lordships because it contains very good detailed examples of precisely the areas in which the detailed scrutiny must take place&#151;I use the word &#147;must&#148;, not &#147;might&#148;. The Constitution Committee and your Lordships&#146; House must be allowed to do the job of scrutiny properly.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09070884000172"></a>It is clear to me that we would do it in a way which makes it absolutely certain that the legislation will be passed. We do not seek to destroy the legislation but it seems to me&#151;this is where I disagree with my noble friend the Leader of the House&#151;that October is soon enough to get this Bill on the statute book. It would be better than &#147;soon enough&#148; as we would end up with a much better piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09070884000173"></a>My second worry is that the gossip around your Lordships' House is that the deal or the stitch-up&#151;a better expression&#151;between the main parties, or rather between the leaders of the main parties, is that the Opposition have been instructed to nod through the Bill. I have heard that from at least one very senior

That means that with all the time in the world the Opposition leadership would devote none of its efforts to scrutiny at all.</p>

I am always willing to believe that I have been misled. I was going to add that the fact that essentially the Opposition were saying that they not going to get involved in scrutiny was unusual, to say the least.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09070884000176"></a>I now have to add one or two quite disrespectful remarks to noble Lords opposite. The most cursory reading of any of the major works on politics and government in this country tells us that the Conservative Party is the custodian of the traditions, notably the constitutional traditions, of our country. For better or worse, the Bill removes 300 years of self-regulation in the other place. You would have thought that the Conservative leadership in the other place would therefore have absolutely nothing to do with a Bill of this kind. You would have thought that if the Liberal leadership&#151;sorry, they are now called the Liberal Democrats, but they used to be Liberals&#151;had any sense of history, they would also not involve themselves in this. I can tell you one person who does not want to be involved at all: that is me.</p>

The fundamental difficulty about the Bill is that it tries to do two separate things, one of which is wholly laudable and that is to deal with the immediate problem of expenses and how they are dealt with. The other is the quite separate question of financial interests; an extremely complicated matter involving the privileges of Parliament and the relationship between Parliament and the courts, which deserves long and careful consideration before we come to any legislative decisions, if those decisions are indeed necessary. The difficulty we face is that both those issues have been bundled into one document. The first needs urgent consideration; the second needs long reflection.</p>

Of course I agree with the noble Lord, but that means that we must give the Bill full scrutiny in this House and take as long as is required. All the problems can be solved by a simple statement from my noble friend the Leader of the House. All she has to do is to say that there will be no accelerated timetable, and then the Government will have their legislation in October. That is all she has to do.

It is certainly highly desirable that that objective should be achieved, but the reality is that the way in which the Bill is being pushed through and the drafting of the Bill will themselves bring Parliament further into disrepute. That is the nub of the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09070884000182"></a>The noble Baroness the Leader of the House says that this is a Bill that Parliament&#151;or, rather, the House of Commons&#151;wants and that the House of Commons ought to have it. I think that that is seriously open to doubt. I do not think that the House of Commons or, indeed, this House wants a Bill that has the most horrendous constitutional implications and undermines some of the basic building blocks on which Parliament operates. That is not the kind of Bill that either the Commons or this House wants or deserves. I find it extraordinary that the Bill in its original form should have appeared as it did. I cannot imagine what the people drafting it were thinking about.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09070884000183"></a>Apparently, what is now envisaged is that we must rush the Bill through so that it is on the statute book before the Summer Recess. Members of Parliament are going to rush back to their constituents waving the Act, as it will then be, almost like Chamberlain returning from Munich, saying, &#147;Fear not! All our troubles are over. You can have faith in Parliament. I am now going to be very carefully regulated by IPSA&#148;&#151;they may ask what that is&#151;&#147;and don&#146;t worry about it. All is well&#148;. Then, if the MP is honest, he will go on to say, &#147;But I feel bound to point out that the cost of getting this to you now, rather than in the autumn, is that serious aspects of the Bill of Rights, which have protected your interests for years, have been eroded and parliamentary privilege has been under attack in order to get this Act to you quickly&#148;. The constituent may well turn round and ask whether parliamentary privilege is something that the MP wants to keep, but the MP may say, &#147;It&#146;s your privilege. It&#146;s people&#146;s privilege, not Parliament&#146;s privilege. It enables me to stand up in the House of Commons and say things without fear of being taken to court by someone I am rightly attacking on your behalf&#148;. It does not seem to me to be sensible to want to create that situation so that Members of Parliament can get to their constituencies with the Act in a few weeks&#146; time, rather than in the autumn, by which time we could deal with some of these immensely difficult problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09070884000184"></a>I shall make one more quick point. The Leader of the House referred to a cross-party consensus. We all know that there is no cross-party consensus. What has been reached between closed doors is an agreement between the leaders of the parties, perhaps motivated to some extent by political expedience in the present circumstances. It is not a cross-party consensus and I hope very much that, in the course of the debates, abbreviated though they may be, unless we accept the

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09070884000185"></a>Having said that, I agree with what the noble Baroness said in her opening remarks about the independent, self-governing aspects of both Houses. We recognise that she is very good at defending the interests of this House and is doing a splendid job in that respect. However, we must recognise that the independence of each House operates both ways. If it were just a question of qualifications, an enormous number of Peers in this House have great experience of the House of Commons and how it works, whereas, alas, very few people at the other end&#151;although one or two of them now appear at the Bar since we have had Secretaries of State in this House&#151;have any idea of what goes on here. That was certainly true when I was in the Commons. So, in terms of qualifications, it is more appropriate to say what we think ought to happen in that House than for them to say what happens in this House. There is no doubt that we win hands down. None the less, I think that the noble Baroness is right to preserve the view that we are independent in that sense.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09070884000186"></a>We have been immensely well served by the committees of the House and, indeed, the Justice Committee in the other place. We have had a succession of extraordinary reports produced at very short notice that ought to form the basis on which we go forward. In particular, the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Goodlad has produced extraordinary reports in a short space of time. For example, the committee&#146;s 17th report points out that the Bill has already been somewhat changed by the Government agreeing to remove one clause and by the defeat on the other very important constitutional clause. It is important to point out that so little time was allowed in the House of Commons for debate on this issue that the implications of the defeat and the consequential amendments were not able to be debated there. They will have to be debated in this House.</p>

The latest report of the Select Committee&#151;and, indeed, the extremely helpful memorandum by the Clerk of the Parliaments, which I am glad has been provided&#151;points out that there are still many issues of great constitutional importance that we need to deal with. I hope that we will be given adequate time and that the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Norton will be accepted, because we can then proceed on a sensible basis. If that is not so, it is important that the Government should clean up the highly objectionable clauses that the various committee reports point to, preferably with government amendments or, certainly, with acceptance of other appropriate amendments, so that we can get a Bill that is not wholly objectionable and does not completely defeat the object that it seeks to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09070884000190"></a>In that context, I refer to the point that was made&#151;perhaps rather unfairly&#151;in the Constitutional Committee&#146;s report. It says that the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, talking,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000272"></a>&#147;24 hours before the removal of the proceedings in Parliament clause&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000240"></a>said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09070884000254"></a>&#147;The package ... is a coherent whole, and no part of it would work without the rest&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070884000241"></a>We have lost at least one major bit since then, so we are entitled to ask the noble Baroness where we stand after that. The committee goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09070884000255"></a>&#147;The bill will accordingly have to be substantially recast. To do so under an accelerated passage is in our view wholly unacceptable given the questions of constitutional principle and detail that it raises&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070884000191"></a>That is a strong statement, but I hope that the noble Baroness can, in winding up, tell us how she proposes to recast the Bill if, indeed, we do not have time to sort it out. None the less, I very much hope that, when we come to a decision on the matter tonight, it will be to allow adequate time, so that Members of the House of Commons can go back to their constituencies saying, &#147;You may be reassured by this Bill, which has been properly considered by Parliament, with a great deal of assistance from the Members of the House of Lords. This is something with which we can now restore faith in Parliament as a whole&#148;.</p>

I agree with the last part of what the noble Lord said, if not the whole. I should declare an interest: I was counsel in the case of Pepper v Hart, dealing with parliamentary privilege, and next week I am in a case where one Secretary of State is trying to use parliamentary privilege to prevent proceedings of this House from being seen by the courts.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09070884000193"></a>The way in which the Government have rushed to introduce and propel this hastily cobbled Bill is not how the Executive should use their law-making powers. However, in considering the Bill, we should remember, as the Leader of the House emphasised, that its aim is to deal with the House of Commons, not the House of Lords. We should not filibuster or thwart but seek to improve the Bill as far as we can. I also agree with my noble kinsman, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, who said that the House must not abdicate its responsibilities but scrutinise and improve the Bill. It is vital for us to work together, across and beyond parties, to increase public confidence in Parliament and politicians and in the fact that in both Houses most of us are, I hope, dedicated to public service.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09070884000194"></a>One of the problems that the Bill creates is its impact on the fundamental constitutional principle that statements made in Parliament should be protected by absolute privilege. As has been said, parliamentary privilege is not some fusty, archaic doctrine, and &#147;privilege&#148; is a misnomer. Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1688 serves  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_699"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 699</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the dual interests of free speech in Parliament and the separation of powers between Parliament and the courts. It is designed not to protect individual MPs but Parliament itself, although for party-political reasons a squalid exception was made in Section 13 of the Defamation Act 1996, enabling MPs to pick and choose, on the basis of personal self-interest, whether to waive parliamentary privilege or to invoke it as claimant or defendant in libel proceedings. That was, as Lord Simon of Glaisdale pointed out, a constitutional monstrosity, which continues to deface the statute book.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09070884000195"></a>Article IX of the Bill of Rights can be taken too far. As I say, I declare an interest as counsel in Pepper v Hart, when I appeared against the then Attorney-General, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, as he will recall, where an attempt was made by him on behalf of the Commons to prevent the courts from referring to what Ministers had said in Parliament when courts interpret ambiguous legislation. It was claimed that the Commons would strongly object if courts were to use <I>Hansard</I> as an extrinsic aid to statutory interpretation. Other common law countries, including Australia, New Zealand, India and the United States, had done so without any violation of their constitutional protection of speech and debate in their parliaments. The Law Lords rejected this inordinate claim and there has not been any subsequent objection from the other place.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09070884000196"></a>More recently, it has even been suggested from Commons advisers that the practice of referring in court to reports of Select Committees, such as the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member, in legal proceedings violates the Bill of Rights because it involves the risk that the courts may question proceedings in Parliament. That, too, is an inordinate claim, which would place the courts in blinkers. I am sure that my noble kinsman, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, would agree, as he has said so in the past as a judge. The courts know when and how to keep off Parliament&#146;s lawns while exercising their vital duty of interpreting the law of the land. There have been important cases where neither the Executive nor the citizen could have had a fair hearing without the benefit of the proceedings of Select Committees when deciding issues of legal public policy and where the courts would have been denied crucial evidence.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09070884000197"></a>In the present case, the Clerk of the Commons has explained his perception of the problems of the privilege aspects of the Bill. He is surely right to remind Parliament of the need for a parliamentary privileges Act to implement the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1999, but there is no appetite for one in the Government. I respectfully do not agree with the Commons Clerk&#146;s opposition to what he describes as,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000273"></a>&#147;tinkering with parliamentary privilege on a piecemeal basis&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000242"></a>If that view were taken literally, it would inhibit or even prevent necessary reforms. His concerns about encroachments on parliamentary privilege are real but they go too far. He takes a similarly negative position on the draft bribery Bill, arguing that privilege prevents any use of anything said in Parliament, even to prove that a Member committed the offence of corruption.  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_700"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 700</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>His memorandum argues in paragraph 19 that admitting evidence of proceedings in Parliament effectively removes the right of free speech.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09070884000198"></a>We should look for enlightenment across the Atlantic. Article I, Section 6, of the American Constitution provides, like our own Article IX, that any speech or debate in either House of Congress,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000274"></a>&#147;shall not be questioned in any other place&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000243"></a>This so-called speech and debate clause protects legislators from punitive executive or judicial action and reinforces separation of powers. In the 1970s, the American Supreme Court considered several cases aimed at preventing claims of privilege from going too far. To take one example, which was referred to the Constitution Committee, in a case called the United States v Brewster a former Senator had been indicted for taking a bribe to influence the performance of his official legislative duties. He sought protection under the speech and debate clause to declare the indictment invalid. In upholding the indictment, the Supreme Court ruled:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09070884000256"></a>&#147;Taking a bribe is obviously no part of the legislative process or function&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070884000244"></a>The clause was read as prohibiting an inquiry into the motivation for performing specific legislative actions. That surely is the common-sense and balanced approach that will be taken by our own courts. I therefore respectfully disagree with the somewhat overprotective approach taken by the Clerk of the Commons. It is important to keep Article IX of the Bill of Rights within proper balance and limits, as our courts and other courts of the Commonwealth and the United States have done in recent times.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09070884000199"></a>The human rights problems are at least as important as those about parliamentary privilege. They were examined by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in its report 10 years ago. It is lamentable that the Government have failed to give effect to its recommendations, including the repeal of Section 13. The committee was chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead. Its members included the noble and learned Lords, Lord Mayhew and Lord Archer, the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, Lord Wigoder, my learned friend Paul Tyler MP, as he then was, and Ann Taylor MP, as she then was&#151;not a bad committee.</p>

<a name="90708-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09070884000200"></a>The committee pointed out in paragraph 280 the importance of ensuring that the procedures followed in the investigation of complaints against MPs should match what it called &#147;contemporary standards of fairness&#148;. It set those out in paragraph 281. Those recommendations were endorsed by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in 1992. The Joint Committee on Human Rights then reaffirmed them and the chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Andrew Dismore MP, speaking in the other place on 29 June at cols. 82-7 of the <I>Official Report,</I> made an extremely strong speech in which he explained them fully. Later in the process, the Justice Secretary, the right honourable Jack Straw, indicated, as I mentioned, that he was open-minded about introducing some fairness guarantees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09070884000201"></a>We do not know what advice the Attorney-General has given. That perhaps illustrates the need for Parliament to have its own legal adviser. Perhaps the much delayed constitutional renewal Bill will have to be amended to

In any event, Ministers must have the committee&#146;s recommendations drawn to their attention as well as its references to Article 6 of the convention and the judgment of the Strasbourg court in the case Demicoli v Malta. As the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege observed 10 years ago:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09070884000257"></a>&#147;The existence of this jurisdiction&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09070884000202"></a>at Strasbourg&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000275"></a>&#147;is a salutary reminder that if the procedures adopted by Parliament when exercising its disciplinary powers are not fair, the proceedings may be challenged by those prejudiced. It is in the interests of Parliament, as well as justice, that Parliament should adopt at least the minimum requirements of fairness&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000245"></a>That applies as much to the functions of IPSA and IPSA&#146;s commissioner as to parliamentary committees. They should have an overriding duty to be manifestly seen to be fair and to ensure fairness in their procedures.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90708-0006.htm"/>


<a name="90708-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09070884000203"></a>There also needs to be a right of appeal, whether through the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council against any determination by IPSA or by the Commons that amounts to the determination of a criminal charge, or a Member&#146;s civil rights and obligations, or through some other body. Having listened to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, I think that the better path might be to include within the Bill at Committee stage something familiar to those who deal with disciplinary offences against lawyers, doctors or accountants, where a special independent and impartial tribunal is set up under the statute that is able to look at the substance of complaints and allegations, and not merely by way of judicial review. I am not drafting, but if one were to say, &#147;For the purposes of this Act, there is to be a tribunal known as the Parliamentary Standards Tribunal, to have the functions conferred on it by this Act&#148;, and, &#147;Members of the House of Commons should have a right of appeal to that tribunal against any determination by IPSA or the House of Commons amounting to the determination of a criminal charge or a Member&#146;s civil rights and obligations, within the meaning of Article 6 of the convention&#148;, that would wholly meet the obligations of the United Kingdom that bind Parliament as well as the courts and the Executive. It would avoid the conflict that everyone is rightly worried about between the Queen&#146;s courts on the one hand and Parliament on the other under the doctrine of parliamentary privilege.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09070884000204"></a>I respectfully suggest, therefore, that consideration might urgently be given to creating the kind of tribunal that the Prime Minister, as Chancellor, created in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 when he set up the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal dealing with disciplinary matters in exactly the way that I have suggested. Those interested in matters north of the border, as I am, will recall that, when recently the Scottish Parliament was dealing with how to discipline naughty solicitors, all these issues were raised and the Scottish Parliament decided to create an independent and impartial special tribunal to deal with disciplinary matters in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09070884000205"></a>I shall not now bore the House by commenting on the Explanatory Notes dealing with legal advice about the European convention. However, I should like to point out one rather comical matter. If, in our sad lives, we study the Explanatory Notes in the Commons and the Lords, we find an interesting difference between  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_702"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the two. The Commons version is extremely tentative and walks on eggshells, whereas the Lords version has been firmed up by reference to a French case involving the Conseil d&#146;État. I do not believe in this case that second thoughts were better than first; I have no doubt that the convention would apply.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09070884000206"></a>Finally, the Constitution Committee pointed clearly in paragraph 35 of its most recent report&#151;from lunchtime&#151;to the need to create a domestic appellate body that is sufficiently independent and impartial to satisfy the requirements of the convention. If that were done, I would feel much more confident in supporting the Bill.</p>

However, among the very sound doctrine about the need and duty of this House to revise legislation coming to it from the House of Commons, there was also a delicate warning off from any notion that we might be looking at an extension of the time that the Government desire the Bill to take. If I remember correctly, the noble Baroness said that this was about the House of Commons only and for the House of Commons, and that it would not be extended to this House. She was taken up on that by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09070884000208"></a>I add one further reference, taken from the first report on this matter from your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution. Paragraph 4 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09070884000258"></a>&#147;A document deposited in the House of Commons Library by the Government on 20 May 2009, referring to the proposed Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, states that it is clearly appropriate that this new body also takes responsibility for these issues in the Lords&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070884000246"></a>It is only fair to go on to say that the document adds:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09070884000259"></a>&#147;We recognise that the principle of self-regulation operates differently in the House of Lords. It is clear that extensive work and consultation will be necessary in order to ensure the agreement of the House to the effective transfer of responsibilities to the new body&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09070884000209"></a>Like my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I look forward keenly to the noble Baroness&#146;s response to the questions that she was asked in that regard. The very brief life of this Bill rather starkly illustrates the wisdom of the old parliamentary adage, &#147;Don&#146;t go legislating in haste, or you will repent at leisure&#148;. A gloss on that might be added, &#147;Especially in July&#148;. The remarkable Clause 6, providing for a statutory code of conduct for MPs, has already had to be withdrawn. In fact, the Lord Chancellor was driven to repent before he had finished his Second Reading speech, by withdrawing that clause. He did so in the face of some savage condemnation for what might be called its unconsidered constitutional dismemberment, with warning criticism, already referred to, from the Clerk of the House of Commons. The Lord Chancellor then suffered the mortification of Clause 10&#151;the no less objectionable parliamentary proceedings clause&#151;being defeated without any debate, the Lord Chancellor's own guillotine having descended on himself. I tried to think of some allusion about petards, but failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09070884000210"></a>Now, today, it was announced at the end of the Leader of the House&#146;s speech that part of Clause 5 relating to paid advocacy is also to be withdrawn. It is a shrinking Bill, but one that I none the less suggest to your Lordships still needs the extra time&#151;that should more appropriately be called the ordinary time&#151;that would be secured by the amendment to be moved later by my noble friend Lord Norton.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09070884000211"></a>One could take a certain grim pleasure in all this if it were not for the fact that the Bill itself is so deeply alarming. So much has been said about that that I shall try not to repeat it. Your Lordships&#146; Select Committee has done full justice to it in a report the like of which, for the severity of its unanimous criticism, I have never seen. Of the two clauses concerned, the report states at paragraph 2:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09070884000260"></a>&#147;Both of these clauses threatened to undermine freedoms which are essential for Parliament to operate properly and risked opening the door to conflict between Parliament and the courts&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09070884000212"></a>Like several noble Lords who have spoken today, I think that it is a real pity that the word &#147;privilege&#148;, attaching as it does to constitutional safeguards, has acquired a rather foreseeable pejorative flavour. In truth, the privilege is that of the public who are ensured that their representatives in Parliament speak without fear of unpleasant consequences, whether at the hands of the Executive or the judges. The trouble with the Bill even as amended in the other place is that it still&#151;I quote again from the Select Committee&#146;s report at paragraph 7&#151;establishes,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000276"></a>&#147;a statutory external regulator of important parliamentary matters, acting within a statutory regime and potentially subject to the jurisdiction of the courts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000247"></a>The committee describes that development as,</p>
<ul><a name="09070884000277"></a>&#147;a profound change which has the potential to give rise to conflict between Parliament and the courts, the implications of which require very careful examination&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070884000248"></a>Those last three words bear perhaps even more weight than what precedes them, and even that is putting the matter a little laconically.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09070884000213"></a>Immense benefits for individual freedom and the rule of law have flowed over the centuries from the settlement in the Bill of Rights and the separate jurisdictions of Parliament and the courts. We had an enormously interesting and authoritative speech from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, on the importance of that being maintained. I am quite certain that the judges do not wish to see it disturbed. I reckon that they are mightily relieved that under our domestic constitutional arrangements, Members of Parliament answer only to their electorates in respect of parliamentary matters, not to the judges. As for the Commons, in my 23 years there, I never detected any desire to offer any sort of welcome for what was liable to be described as interference from the judges.</p>

I am afraid the answer is that Ministers have simply lost their heads. I have sympathy for them and for all MPs in their present travails, but it cannot be sensible to behave like this, without even a sunset clause, in order that,</p>

<p><a name="09070884000215"></a>It cannot be sensible either, I suggest, on constitutional grounds. Nor can it on more immediate practical grounds, for when its true import is understood, it is likely to diminish public confidence even further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09070884000216"></a>My right honourable friend Mr David Heathcoat-Amory said at Second Reading in the other place:</p>

<p><a name="09070884000217"></a>That, I suggest, should be the operative perspective. What is needed from this House, therefore, is surely some cool, calm deliberation.</p>

Does that not give rise to a practical problem, which has to be solved; that is, to ensure fairness by some tribunal that will prevent the Strasbourg court having to intervene? That is what the Joint Committee was saying.</p>

That is one of the many complex matters that deserves far fuller discussion and decision than is possible for somebody standing on his feet, either when making a speech or having it interrupted. I was suggesting, perhaps presumptuously, that some cool, calm deliberation is needed. Very notably, that is what was called for in the other place by the very senior and experienced Labour Member Mr Denis MacShane. He said&#151;reluctantly, as a long-standing socialist and no friend of the House of Lords as it is presently constituted&#151;that he hoped that the Lords,</p>

I add my own tribute to the way in which the noble Baroness the Leader of the House presented the Bill this afternoon, but I wish to differ from her in one respect. She was, I think, trying to argue that the Bill has gone through all its stages in another place and that, as it applies only to that other place, it is for Members there to decide how the evil should be remedied.  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_705"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 705</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>As we have heard very clearly this afternoon, the rights and privileges of Parliament are put at hazard in the Bill. That affects your Lordships as well as the other place.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09070884000223"></a>The Government are much attached to constitutional reform. This measure is constitutional reform with a vengeance. It might almost be called &#147;constitutional regression&#148;. We should think long and hard before passing with unseemly and unnecessary haste a measure that puts at hazard parliamentary rights and privileges, which have been, as was pointed out, so long and hard fought for, and which lie at the heart of our democratic freedom. As Feste says to Malvolio:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09070884000264"></a>&#147;That is not the way&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09070884000224"></a>It would not be beyond the wit of man to devise a remedy for the evil that this Bill seeks to deal with which would avoid this hazard. The Bill provides for a new independent authority, IPSA, to determine and pay the salaries and allowances of Members of Parliament and to propose and police a code of conduct relating to their financial interests. It is true that the new authority's recommendations and proposals are to be subject to the approval of the House of Commons, but that is no more than a right of veto. A right of veto may look good in principle but can well be very difficult to act on and to exercise in practice. The power of proposal and decision should remain with Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09070884000225"></a>It may be argued that the public anger and distrust of Members of Parliament is so great that the abdication of authority by the House of Commons proposed in this Bill is a necessary part of the remedy if a measure of trust is to be restored. However, as has been said this afternoon, it would be a very high price to pay. Members of Parliament have received a no doubt very salutary shock from the recent exposures of the uses and abuses of the system of allowances and expenses. As the Leader of the House has said, the great majority of them are decent and hardworking people and they will be as keen as anybody else to restore trust. I believe that most of them would not just accept but would positively welcome a framework under which they themselves would be responsible for setting up, approving and abiding by a new system for regulating their allowances and expenses and a new code of conduct relating to their financial interests.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09070884000226"></a>The system will need to provide clarity, scrutiny, transparency and sanctions. It will need to provide the least possible degree of ambiguity and the greatest possible degree of clarity in the structure of rules and entitlements; scrutiny of claims by independent scrutineers paid for but not employed by Parliament; transparency so that claims by and payments to Members can be made known to the public; and sanctions for abusive claims and breaches of the code of conduct.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09070884000227"></a>This system could be administered and supervised by a new House of Commons commission or committee of senior Members of Parliament, none of them from the Front Benches, chosen by the Members of the House of Commons as people of unquestionable and widely respected integrity and trustworthiness. I will not try to name any such people although I am sure they exist: I have no desire to risk damaging their reputations by doing so. This committee would in a  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_706"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 706</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sense resemble the audit committee in a public company. It would consist of people who had no executive ministerial or shadow ministerial responsibilities and would be immune from the baneful and baleful influence of the Whips.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09070884000228"></a>This committee, acting on the authority of and reporting to the whole House of Commons, would be responsible for framing the code of conduct and the arrangements for allowances and expenses. It would receive reports from those scrutinising claims and payments where rulings by the scrutineers were challenged by the Members concerned, and would make recommendations to the House when it was thought necessary to apply sanctions to individual Members. Such a committee or commission&#151;I suppose that it might be called a Speaker&#146;s conference&#151;could also have responsibility for determining and proposing the salaries of Members of the House of Commons, though I entirely see that they might feel the need, and should be able if they wished, to employ the services of a review body or some such body to assist them in that work. Such a system would not infringe the rights and privileges of Parliament. Members of the House of Commons would remain masters in their own house.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09070884000229"></a>By themselves creating and voluntarily accepting such a system, Members would express their determination to restore, maintain and deserve a reputation for trustworthiness, and do so more effectively and convincingly than they would by grudgingly and reluctantly falling in with a system of external discipline imposed on them. It might even be possible to introduce and establish such a system without legislation.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09070884000230"></a>Given the criticisms of the Government&#146;s Bill by the Select Committee on the Constitution, and by many others in the House this afternoon, and given that, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, pointed out, legislation passed in haste usually comes quickly to be repented at leisure, we should do well to allow a pause for reflection and reconsideration. The Government should desist from seeking to push their Bill through before the Summer Recess and allow time for other, less unsatisfactory remedies for the admitted deficiencies of the existing arrangements to be worked out and considered. I am sure that, in any but the shortest perspective, the Government will gain greater public credit from taking time to get it right than they will get from trying to force through a measure that is so widely thought to be dangerous and defective.</p>

If I do not follow him in that regard, perhaps I may be forgiven.

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09070890000002"></a>This Bill is one of the most deeply disturbing Bills that I have seen in my 45 years in Parliament. In this, I believe, I am reflecting the views of a great many Members&#151;not only noble Lords in this House but also Members in another place, of all parties. Indeed,  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_707"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 707</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on Monday I was approached by a couple of government supporters in another place who expressed to me the hope that this House would simply throw it out. I said to them that it might be rather difficult for us to do that.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09070890000003"></a>I entirely understand and recognise the immense pressures that have been put on Members of another place by the hot public anger over the expenses scandal. I must share part of the blame for that. I was a member of a Cabinet which had a recommendation for an increase in the salaries of Members of Parliament; we came to the conclusion that it would be politically easier to increase their expenses, rather than their salaries. With hindsight, it is impossible not to see in this the seeds of the present expenses scandal which has done so much damage not only to the integrity of the system but to the whole political system itself.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09070890000004"></a>I would like to pick up a point made by my noble and learned friend Lord Howe. I am even more concerned by the traumatic loss of confidence in themselves on the part of many Members of another place as a consequence of the disclosures and what they have suffered as a result of the public reaction.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09070890000005"></a>Of course I recognise that all the parties share the objective of restoring public trust in our parliamentary institutions; indeed if our democracy is to survive that is absolutely crucial. We have had in the past a proud tradition of representative self-government. This must continue. But I cannot believe that this Bill, and the new code of conduct that it seeks to enshrine, is the right way to do this. Like others, I am reinforced in this view by the devastating series of reports that have come before us from committees in both Houses in recent days. We are immensely grateful for the work that those committees have done to enable us to take account of their deliberations. They have been referred to already and I do not need to do that again.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09070890000006"></a>What I should refer to, and I read it all, is the evidence given to the Justice Committee in another place by the Clerk in another place, Dr Malcolm Jack, about the effect of the Bill on Article IX of the Bill of Rights, on free speech and on everything on which our free democracy depends. It was rightly said by some wise man that the freedom of speech of Members of Parliament is at the heart of the freedom of speech of everyone else. It is, indeed, at the heart of our constitution.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09070890000007"></a>These are formidable issues which have been raised in these reports, and they need to be debated in full. I am simply repeating what has been said by others, and I hope that the Leader of the House has taken note of them. I note what she said about not moving the Motion regarding the Report and Third Reading, but we do not know what she will put in its place. It would be extremely helpful if she could tell the House this evening what she is now proposing.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09070890000008"></a>Others will be much better equipped than I am to advance the legal and constitutional arguments, but I should like to make just one major point. Not for the first time, the Prime Minister has wholly failed to understand the impact of how his proposals actually look to the people at whom they are aimed. What this Bill seems really to represent, and will be read by many as representing, is that all Members of another place  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_708"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 708</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are a bunch of immoral, self-seeking villains on whom a swingeing panoply of new controls, new rules and new penalties must be imposed if they are to regain the trust of the public. What does this actually say to the public? Surely it says that their perceptions, honed by the media, are right: that MPs are a bunch of self-seeking&#151;and so on&#151;villains who need to be brought to heel. The impact of this Bill is not making people say, &#147;Well, that&#146;s sorted then; now they will all behave properly&#148;. That is not what they are saying at all. They are saying that their perceptions are simply being reinforced and that the costs of doing this, in terms of the constitutional vandalism it involves, have to be accepted as a necessary evil to achieve that end.</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09070890000009"></a>What is the impact of the Bill on Members of another place? My noble and learned friend Lord Howe made this point very clearly. Again the Prime Minister has it wrong. Instead of concentrating on restoring the powers of the House of Commons and the health of its procedures&#151;as has already been said, Clause 10 was removed without a single word of debate because the guillotine had fallen&#151;and on Parliament&#146;s critical role in holding the Executive to account and scrutinising legislation, free from any threats of repercussions in the courts and elsewhere, this Bill simply reinforces Members&#146; loss of self-confidence, because the Government have not said any of that. MPs are being told that only the threat of the courts interfering in proceedings in Parliament, and the threat of new punishments after summary justice, will keep them in their place. Is anyone surprised that a number of able, long-serving and distinguished Members of another place have decided to call it a day and retire at the next election?</p>

<a name="90708-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09070890000010"></a>When part of the new panoply of measures is what I can only describe as the vindictive new rule about disclosing not only interests but how much money is earned from them, and how many hours are spent on earning that money&#151;when you see all that&#151;can you blame the Member of Parliament who spoke to me the other day, and who is giving up, when he said that he really was not willing to live in a goldfish bowl?</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09070890000011"></a>That is why I regard the Bill as almost wholly misconceived. Why does it impose new criminal penalties when the existing law already covers theft and fraud? Why does it open the door to the courts concerning themselves with proceedings in Parliament&#151;something that they have never had to do before? Why does it provide for enforcement procedures that may infringe the European Convention on Human Rights? Why should we rush through all this legislation and major constitutional changes? As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has asked twice at Question Time, what is the hurry?</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09070890000012"></a>Our job is to rescue another place from itself. The House of Commons is, above all, a citizens&#146; Parliament, representative of all the interests and varied communities that make up our nation. We do not want to end up with a Parliament consisting only of full-time politicians with no outside interests, cowed by what the Clerk at the other end called the &#147;chilling effect&#148; of finding themselves accountable not to their constituents but to the courts. That will be the effect of the Bill unless it is amended drastically.</p>

There has been no consultation to speak of on the Bill&#146;s provisions, and a never-ending stream of complaints about the lack of it. One obvious consequence was the deletion of two objectionable clauses in the course of the hasty two-day Committee proceedings in the other place.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09070890000014"></a>The Bill presented to your Lordships for Second Reading is therefore different in important respects from that presented to the Commons, and will be subject to further government amendment in the course of proceedings here, as we learnt earlier in the debate. Nevertheless, the basic principles of the original Bill remain. Furthermore, as we have heard, we are expected to complete our detailed consideration of the Bill before we rise for the Summer Recess on 21 July. This is fast-tracking in Formula 1 style, crashing through barriers galore.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09070890000015"></a>Why all the hurry, when all who have studied the Bill are urging care and caution? This is a constitutional Bill touching on fundamental principles, as our Constitution Committee&#151;headed by my noble friend Lord Goodlad&#151;and others have pointed out in their excellent reports. The Government have told us that they hope to have the independent parliamentary standards authority in place early next year. Presumably the commissioner for parliamentary investigations would follow soon after. The rest of the parliamentary rescue operation would also be executed as envisaged by the Government, for the benefit and gratification of an angry electorate who will brook no delay, according to the Leader of the House. All necessary reforms under the Bill should be done and dusted before the next election. That is the scenario that we are asked to accept.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09070890000016"></a>I will quote a constitutional expert, Mr Barry Winetrobe, who wrote a memorandum to the Justice Committee of the other place, which is now printed in its seventh report. He wrote that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070890000097"></a>&#147;the usual longer-term result of these Executive-driven reactive responses is the further weakening of Parliament, in relation to the Executive, to the detriment of the public&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070890000086"></a>I fully endorse that summary view.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09070890000017"></a>A governmental package such as this Bill is little short of an insult to my concept of Parliament. It will certainly not enhance the reputation of the other place and may very well further detract from it, as a number of your Lordships have suggested. Reading between the lines, one suspects that the ultimate effect of these provisions will be to subject Parliament still further to the Government&#146;s will, as has happened time and again. The creation of offences unique to membership of the House of Commons under Clause 8 is particularly galling, especially when related to the fact that some of these offences already exist for other citizens under other statutes. Do we really need offences specific to MPs? I was very glad to hear the noble Baroness the Leader of the House saying that one of these offences would be withdrawn in the course of proceedings here, and, of course, we have the full assessment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, on this issue.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_710"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09070890000018"></a>Of course, the Commons should never have got themselves into this dangerous position where their nominal or&#151;should I say?&#151;quasi self-regulation of pay and allowances could be so extensively abused. This provoked the extreme chagrin and disgust of the electorate when it was revealed to them first by the<I> Daily Telegraph</I> and then in the odious, redacted version obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Yet, when we seek the causa et origo of this extremely perilous position, I find it very difficult to exonerate the Government from some blame for negligence. They have dominated the Commons for the last decade, not only through their party majority, their leadership of the House and the precedence given to their business at every sitting, but institutionally, behind the scenes. The wishes of the Government are supreme and their influence irresistible in this context. They create the ethos in which Parliament operates and may be held culpable if a corrupt and mendacious ethos prevails.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09070890000019"></a>On a personal note, I was a Member of the Commons for 27 years and stood down in 1997. Towards the end of the Major Government the atmosphere in the Commons on our side was uncomfortable to say the least, besieged as we were by the gutter press, but the discomfort nowadays permeates all parties. Some remedial action should have been taken long before this, preferably by the House itself. The current situation should certainly have been foreseen.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09070890000020"></a>Ultimately, we must ask ourselves whether something can be made of this Bill. It has some fundamental defects. In my mind, it is clear that we must not further compromise the independence of the House of Commons and belittle it as an institution. Its privileges, particularly freedom of speech, must be safeguarded. There must be no further encroachment by the Crown which has long since moved from royal palaces to No. 10. We must also buttress the self-regulatory aspects of each House of Parliament in the near certain knowledge that what is imposed on the other place today will be imposed upon us tomorrow. I hear indeed what the noble Baroness the Leader of the House said to us earlier, but again, like my noble friend who has just spoken, I refer her to what was said by the Justice Secretary. All I want to emphasise to her and to the House is that the Justice Secretary actually referred to the Prime Minister, so it is not just he alone who holds the view. Let me quote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09070890000094"></a>&#147;As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made clear on 10 June, it is envisaged that in due course the arrangements relating to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority should indeed apply to the other place; that is why we sought to create an authority that covers both Houses&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> Commons, 29/6/09, col. 47.]</p>

Yes, the Justice Secretary did make that statement on 29 June. Yes, he was quoting from my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and, as I said earlier, I myself have said in this House that I thought at some stage it would be appropriate for this Bill to pertain to the House of Lords. I now speak with the full authority of government. This Bill does not and will not apply to the House of Lords. I categorically state that fact and

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09070890000023"></a>The issue of timing has arisen in the course of this debate and my view is that ideally there should be time to properly review the relationships between Parliament, Government and the public to establish key principles and build upon them. It is also my view that this Bill is not a suitable vehicle for that purpose, but of course we shall see in the course of amending it.</p>

Listening to some of the quite brilliant speeches we have heard today from the former Lord Chief Justice and many others, I must say that I have my doubts but I am sure my noble friend for whom I have the greatest respect will support it. I am extremely concerned that a major constitutional Bill of this kind should be rushed through in the timescale that is suggested without being properly considered. Indeed, whether a Bill of this kind is even necessary is becoming clearer and clearer the more we hear from distinguished Members of your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09070890000025"></a>A couple of times in the House the other day, I asked our Chief Whip what the hurry was. The reply that I got, which was rather brief, if not to say slightly rude, was that it was self-evident. But listening to this debate there is nothing self-evident about rushing this Bill. Some of us on this side of the House have received an e-mail from my noble friend. I can quote it because e-mails, as we all know, are quoted quite frequently around the world. This one is very interesting because of this criticism of the Front Bench. My noble friend assured us that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070890000098"></a>&#147;the consensus remains with the Lib Dems and the Tory Front Bench&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070890000087"></a>That was also rightly stated by the noble Earl when he referred to all Front-Benchers. I have said it before in this House that all Front-Benchers do not usually speak for the Back-Benchers in this House. On these kinds of issues, and on Lords reform, they certainly do not.</p>

<p><a name="09070890000088"></a>My noble friend went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070890000099"></a>&#147;the report by the Constitutional Committee was excoriating&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070890000089"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Peston looked up that word in the dictionary but I assure noble Lords that, whatever it said there, if anything it understated the extent of the condemnation of this haste by the Constitution Committee. The committee&#146;s report was brilliant and explained matters fully. I shall not go into it again because it has been referred to frequently and has probably already been read by most of the speakers in the debate today.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09070890000026"></a>The main case put by my noble friend for the haste in relation to this Bill is that the public want it. The mass of the great British public have many concerns  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_712"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 712</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but I have little doubt in my mind about their concern with MPs. I am sure that the public&#146;s concerns are with other matters, and we all know it. All Front-Benchers in the other place and many others are running scared of the media&#151;that is what this is about. However, I urge noble Lords not to be in a mad rush with this Bill; there is no need for it.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09070890000027"></a>My noble friend Lord Peston said that the Minister has only to say tonight that there will be full discussion and that she will not seek to fast-track the Bill, and she will get the Bill by October, probably amended, as she and many others have suggested. Therefore, there is absolutely no case for rushing it through over the next couple of weeks; it would be absurd to do so. Unless my noble friend is able to assure us of that&#151;and I would regret it if she did not&#151;I shall support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. That would at least delay the Bill so that it had to continue until October, unless the Government decide to recall Parliament in September. That would probably be more to the liking of the media than trying to rush it through now.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09070890000028"></a>Whatever you do, running scared of the media will not help you with the criticism that you get. The media are in full cry but I hope that we can ignore that and concentrate on the real issues. The Bill has already been scrutinised by Select Committees and in some of the speeches here today. For my part, as I said, I hope that my noble friend will give us the reassurance that I seek. If she does not, I shall support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Norton, and I hope that everyone else will as well.</p>

I also thank her for the way in which she kindly allowed me yesterday, at her request, to talk to her about my concerns about the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09070890000030"></a>I am not a lawyer, nor am I a former Member of the House of Commons. Many others who have spoken and will speak after me are far more expert and articulate than me, but I am a passionate defender of the British constitution and I feel extremely strongly about the damage that is being done by the Bill to the basic constitutional strength on which our democracy rests.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09070890000031"></a>I should like to make two very simple points, although others have made them far better and perhaps slightly differently. First, Members of Parliament have certainly suffered a blow to their public esteem. The allegations have applied to a small minority of them but there are no headlines in saying that there are 400-odd honest MPs. No one wants to read a headline like that. After the first few days when the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> had done a necessary job of exposing the dangers of the expenses system, it began to descend into nothing but salacious gossip along the lines of, &#147;Guess what someone claimed for&#148;, and so on. That contributed absolutely nothing to the important point that was being made about the difficulties of the expenses structure.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09070890000032"></a>However, that is a very small part of what is at issue here. This matter involves one fleeting generation of a  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_713"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 713</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very small number of MPs but, because of their behaviour and because of the way in which one or two newspapers blew it up and it was then picked up by the sound media and television, we&#151;corporately, as a country&#151;have allowed the whole reputation of the democratic heart of our Parliament to be put very much under suspicion. We cannot do that. This is a temporary matter, and it will be very temporary. Already down at the Dog and Duck they are not talking about MPs&#146; expenses and they certainly will not be doing so in another six months&#146; time. As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, said, people have other concerns on their minds, and it is very important to look to the long term.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09070890000033"></a>We need to help people to understand&#151;perhaps they already have a gut understanding of this&#151;that Members of Parliament are the people. They are not individuals&#151;Mr Bloggs and Miss Jones&#151;but representatives of the people. As I keep saying, they are the heart of our democracy, and the voice of the people is heard through the freedom of speech and freedom of action that Members of Parliament are able to exercise in Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09070890000034"></a>As the only female to speak in this debate after the noble Baroness, the Leader of the House, introduced the Bill so eloquently, I hope that I can be forgiven if I introduce a rather homely example of my concerns. Anyone who has ever taught young children or who has been a parent of young children knows one simple truth: the more they are trusted, the better they behave, but the more they are watched over, suspected and caught out at every opportunity, the more they will behave properly when watched but behave very badly when not being watched. I think that we have seen in the way in which the Bill is worded an example of the danger of failing to trust people. Failing to trust our Members of Parliament is, as I have said many times in the past couple of minutes, a failure to trust the people of this country who elect them and give them the freedoms to which they are entitled.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09070890000035"></a>I hope that we can convey to Members of the House at the other end of the Corridor that they must stand up for their own freedoms. To me, it is extraordinary that they have voted through a Bill that now makes them subject to scrutiny from an outside body which is not part of the democratic process. That says, &#147;We are not to be trusted. We are people whom you cannot trust, and the only way that we can restore any kind of confidence is for someone to watch over us and breathe down our necks&#148;. Therefore, I believe very strongly that if people&#146;s trust in Parliament and in Members of Parliament is to be restored, it is vital that those Members of Parliament reassert their authority.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09070890000036"></a>I was unfortunate enough to be on a public panel last week in which the debate was about who governs: the media, politicians or the people themselves? The point was made that the politicians are the people but every time someone tried in any way to defend the actions of politicians, there were hoots of derision. People commented, &#147;They tried to blame the system but they themselves created the system&#148;. It appeared to me as a lay person and non-expert that a very simple measure would be to say, &#147;We as parliamentarians and Members of the House of Commons will create a new system in which the public can have trust. We will not let someone else do it for us but will do it ourselves&#148;.

That is a lay, non-expert view of what I should like to see happen. I agree with almost every other speaker that the Bill does nothing to restore public confidence, it does nothing to restore the standing of Parliament and it does nothing to enhance our democracy.</p>

<a name="09070890000037"></a><b><a name="90708-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070890000117"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> My Lords, I recognise the urgency for this Bill, but it is not so urgent as to exclude proper scrutiny. I understand that the Government want to get IPSA working on the scheme as soon as possible, but we need to be satisfied that the Bill is right. The Government could and should, at the very least, provide further time for the Committee stage on Wednesday and/or Thursday next week in place of the not very urgent legislation which is now listed for both those days. I understand that the Committee stage of both of those Bills will not be completed before the Recess, so it will make very little difference indeed if they are replaced in the timetable by this Bill. I am absolutely certain that one day in Committee for this Bill will not be enough, and I am far from certain that two will be sufficient.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09070890000038"></a>The basic principle of the Bill, the setting up of IPSA as a body independent of control by the House of Commons with a duty to set up and manage the allowances scheme, has been endorsed by all three parties, or at least their leaders, and I believe rightly so. I agree that the new code should be prepared by IPSA and should require approval by the House of Commons, although that could cause problems in the case of disagreements between IPSA and the House of Commons. We shall see whether that occurs.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09070890000039"></a>In my view, there are quite serious problems with Clauses 6 and 7 on investigations and enforcement respectively. Those problems have been pointed out by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, by my noble friend Lord Lester in the debate today and particularly effectively by the Constitution Committee of your Lordships' House in its admirable report. There is a need for proceedings to be fair and for there to be a right of appeal, whether to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council or to some other independent and impartial body. Various options could be adopted for that. We shall have to think about that very rapidly.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09070890000040"></a>I have serious doubts about Clause 7, even though I understand that the Government have now agreed to withdraw the subsection which allows IPSA to make recommendations about disciplinary proceedings to the Committee on Standards and Privileges before it has decided on the actual sanction. That was a very unusual and, frankly, odd provision which divided responsibility for imposing punishment and could have led to all sorts of difficulties. It is essential that it goes.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09070890000041"></a>The way in which the system operates seems to be that under Clause 6 the commissioner makes a report and sends it to IPSA. It is not wholly clear what happens next. Does IPSA simply accept the report? Does it have any power of its own to carry out further investigation? Is it bound to accept the report as factually correct? If not, does it have power to modify  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_715"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 715</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the report? What sort of representation can be made to IPSA by the Member who is subject to the investigation? Now that IPSA will not be authorised to give a recommendation to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, what will IPSA do with the report when it gets it, apart from file it in its archive? That is not the way to conduct business. It will be extremely slow. As IPSA does not have any disciplinary powers itself, I think it should be out of the loop altogether and that the commissioner should simply report straight to the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09070890000042"></a>Another provision which concerns me is Clause 8. Is it right that Members of Parliament should be subject to criminal offences to which no one else at all is subject? I am very doubtful about that. The offence in Clause 8(1) of knowingly giving false or misleading information for the purpose of claiming an allowance is plainly a fraudulent act which is already a criminal offence with a much higher maximum sentence than is proposed under that subsection of the Bill. I agree with the Constitution Committee&#146;s report in paragraph 39, where it says that no criminal offences should be applicable only to MPs when the general criminal law already covers the situation.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09070890000043"></a>However, the committee goes beyond that. The offence under Clause 8(2) of failing to register an interest is hardly serious enough to justify criminal proceedings and could perfectly adequately be left to disciplinary action by the House of Commons and its power to suspend or to expel a Member from the House. For that particular misbehaviour that seems to be a perfectly adequate punishment. In addition, the Constitution Committee in paragraph 22 points out that Clause 8(2) could lead to a conflict between the courts and Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09070890000044"></a>The offence under Clause 8(3) of paid advocacy is probably not a criminal offence at present but is likely to become one, if and when the draft bribery Bill, now getting pre-legislative scrutiny, is enacted. The Constitution Committee says that a criminal offence of paid advocacy is unlikely to be workable. In my view, the conclusion is that all three of the offences in Clause 8 should be removed from the Bill; and I am certainly prepared to support the amendments tabled by the Conservative Party to remove them from the Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09070890000045"></a>The changes which I believe are needed to Clauses 6 and 7 and the removal of Clause 8 do nothing to prejudice the fundamental purpose of the Bill. I believe that they would improve it.</p>

<a name="90708-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09070890000046"></a>I very much welcome the idea of a sunset clause as, given the inadequate time to get this Bill through, it is likely to produce serious problems within the next couple of years. For an unavoidable sunset clause to come into effect in a year&#146;s time would be too soon as that would take us up to shortly after the next general election, but a two-year period would be sufficient to give time for further consideration and to identify the shortcomings of the Bill, not all of which I suspect have yet been realised by those of us speaking in this debate. Although we are anxious to get this Bill through quickly and although we certainly support the principles behind it, I believe that we shall need to carry out a very detailed inspection even within the very limited time that may be made available to us.</p>

<a name="09070890000047"></a><b><a name="90708-0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070890000118"></a>Lord Crickhowell:</b> My Lords, I was struck by the final remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that there may be even more flaws revealed in this Bill than have already been exposed during the course of this debate. In all the 39 years that I have been in Parliament, I have never seen an important Bill handled in such an extraordinary way and I am tempted to say such a scandalous way. As early as Second Reading in another place, it was announced that Clause 6, which provided that the Commons should continue to have a code of conduct, was being dropped after deadly criticism by the Clerk of the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09070890000048"></a>Clause 10 would have directly excluded the operation of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights from the functions of IPSA. This, the Clerk of the Commons said, would have a,</p>
<ul><a name="09070890000100"></a>&#147;chilling effect on the freedom of speech of Members and of witnesses before committees and would hamper the ability of House officials to give advice to Members&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070890000090"></a>I am certain that never in my 39 years here has the Clerk thought it necessary to make a similar intervention to protect not just the rights of Parliament, but its ability to serve the people whom it represents. I very much doubt that there have been many, if any, similar interventions in the history of Parliament. Before the other place had concluded its rushed and curtailed consideration of the Bill, the Government were defeated in a Division on Clause 10 as a result of an amendment that, because of the guillotine, was not even debated. Clause 5, to which I will return, was inadequately debated, although it was the subject of particularly devastating and destructive speeches, and an important subsection was removed.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09070890000049"></a>Sometimes, when there are genuine emergencies threatening the state, it is justifiable to rush through legislation with minimum debate, but this is not one of them. Most of the conduct rules could have been approved by the other place without any legislation. The Standards and Privileges Committee in the other place said that there should have been a draft Bill that went through due process to get it right. Consideration of the Bill could have been held over until the autumn, with the advantage that it might then have been able to take account of the Kelly committee report. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, suggested that it was a mistake to pass a Bill to enforce standards yet to be established.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09070890000050"></a>The Bill could have been divided and, if it was really necessary, a one or two-clause Bill could have been put on the statute book before the Recess. As it is, the Bill is likely to leave a large number of important questions still unresolved, because it has taken apart one system, transferred some functions and left other functions spinning in an unresolved vacuum. Sir George Young&#146;s analysis of those problems at Second Reading deserves study.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09070890000051"></a>I completely understand the need for new arrangements to deal with the pay and allowances of MPs. It is all too clear that the existing scheme has been a disaster. Like my noble friend Lord Jenkin, I suppose that I have to plead guilty for some responsibility, having been a member of a Cabinet that refused to increase the pay of Members of Parliament and said that it  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_717"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 717</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be better if they got more allowances. As the scandal unfolded, hardly anyone has been more angry than the spouses of those of us who had to struggle in an era when expense allowances were minimal and all Ministers were deemed to have their principal houses in London. I can tell you that my wife can be extremely strong on the subject. However, I am pretty sure that in time&#151;perhaps it will not be very long&#151;we may come to regret the fact that so much authority is being transferred to unelected quangos and away from Members of Parliament, who have to answer to and may be dismissed by their electors.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09070890000052"></a>I was not much comforted by the statement by the Leader of the House in her opening speech that IPSA must have some&#151;I am pretty sure that she said &#147;some&#148;&#151;understanding of the way that Parliament works. My fear is that it may not have enough understanding of matters that are essential for good parliamentary government. I was also not entirely comforted by her intervention in the speech of my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy. She said that the Bill would not apply to the House of Lords, but I fear that it may be the model for a Bill that will apply to the House of Lords. I do not think that she said that IPSA would not be the body that would be responsible for dealing with the affairs of the House of Lords, either.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09070890000053"></a>The 18th report of the Select Committee on the Constitution, published only today, raises some very significant issues, referred to by my noble friend Lord Goodlad, about the necessity to ensure the political neutrality of IPSA. It draws attention to the fact that the statute-based prohibition of paid advocacy and the creation of a criminal offence of engaging in paid advocacy may open up a possible area of conflict between the courts and Parliament. The committee also pointed out that the decision-making powers of IPSA should be subject to the possibility of appeal. It draws attention to the complex human rights issues, also raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We were given no consolation at all by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House, who said that the Government do not agree with the Joint Committee. I fear that we are getting into very murky waters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09070890000054"></a>I had always intended to say some robust words about how this House should deal with the Bill, but then I read the 17th report of the Select Committee on the Constitution, chaired by my noble friend Lord Goodlad, which was published on Monday. The committee's language was more robust than even I had in mind, and its opinion much more authoritative. I take simply its last conclusion as my text:</p>
<ul><a name="09070890000101"></a><b>&#147;</b>we do not think that the case for proceeding with this bill on a fast-track timetable has been established and we do not support any curtailment of the usual legislative timetable<b>&#148;.</b></ul>
<a name="90708-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09070890000055"></a>It is in the face of that recommendation that I heard with surprise and dismay that only one day was being set aside for Committee and one for Report and Third Reading. I understand that because Members in the other place are anxious to conclude the whole business as quickly as possible, the usual channels have concluded what I can only describe as an unholy pact and accepted a timetable that fails to meet the Constitution Committee&#146;s requirements and will almost certainly be inadequate to complete our work as it should be completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09070890000056"></a>I very much welcome the fact that my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth has tabled an amendment to the Motion to follow this debate. I will support it, and I hope that others will. I very much hope that it will be passed. If it is not, I fear that that is a decision that we will all come to regret. At the very least, we must get a sunset clause into the Bill. The Bill has been introduced by a dying Government into a demoralised and shell-shocked House of Commons. It is likely that about half the Members of that House will not return after the election, so we will have an elected Chamber in which there may even be a majority who will be entirely new. We are legislating not so much for this Parliament, but for its successor. That means that a refreshed Parliament, with a new mandate, should have the opportunity to revisit the Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09070890000057"></a>Earlier, I mentioned Clause 5, which has had subsection (8) removed. At a recent meeting in this building, one of my noble friends said that the original clause was aimed by the Prime Minister at the heart of the Conservative Party. I responded by saying that in my view it was aimed at the heart of the effectiveness of the House of Commons. It is true that the damage was done before the Bill appeared when, in April, the other place agreed a new code of conduct&#151;or perhaps it was earlier, when the Nolan rules were accepted rather too easily, without enough realisation of some of their consequences.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09070890000058"></a>Old Clause 5 would have taken Parliament a very big step down an increasingly rocky road. Then, in the face of sustained criticism, Clause 5(8) was deleted. The overall effect of Clause 5 in the amended Bill may not be very different. It gives statutory authority to what were rules and are now a code under which Members must register the precise amount of each individual payment, the number of hours worked during the period to which the payment referred, the nature of the work, and the name of the individual or organisation who made the payment.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09070890000059"></a>Under the conventions that govern our conduct, I believe I should not quote the words of Members in another place unless they are Ministers. If that were not so, I would have liked to quote a large part of the speech of Mr Frank Field. I beg noble Lords to read it. He spoke of representative government, the principles that should underlie it and how the House of Commons should, through those who sit in it, be a mirror of the society that they represent. Over the centuries, Parliament has been about representing interests, but now it is judged that the great interests in this country should not be represented and that if Members attempt to do so, they might be expelled or imprisoned. He spoke of the change that had come over the other place during the past 50 years, during the course of which the pool from which MPs are drawn has become narrower and narrower. He thought that Clause 5 would further change the nature of the House and that it is unworkable.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09070890000060"></a>The nature of the House has changed in a fundamental way since I entered it in 1970, and not for the better. Then, it was full of people with wide experience representative of and knowledgeable about trade unions, business, industry, law, farming, the services and so many other things besides. There were many who, because of outside incomes and the ability to find  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_719"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 719</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employment outside, were able to take an independent stand on great issues and defy the Whips, not fearful that they might never achieve ministerial office or be able to find employment if they lost their seats. I do not think it an improvement that the number of such people there today is smaller. I do not think it an improvement that it is increasingly difficult to find Members qualified to become the law officers. I do not think it an improvement that there has been a great increase in the number of those who have no other skills or experience, except those of politics, and no prospect of obtaining jobs outside politics. I agreed with every single word that my noble friend Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market had to say on this subject.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09070890000061"></a>I had no private income, and I could never have contemplated becoming a candidate, let alone an MP, if I had not had another job. It is true that the pay then was far less and that the allowances that we were entitled to claim would hardly register on the scale of the modern system but, even today, I am certain that there are many capable of giving good public service who would not feel able to sacrifice their own and, more importantly, their family&#146;s standard of living if it became impossible for them to hold down other jobs as well as fulfilling their parliamentary duties.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09070890000062"></a>Still more will be deterred by a system that is intrusive and unworkable. The language being used about those with other jobs is frequently offensive and nonsensical, born of ignorance or jealousy. &#147;Moonlighting&#148; is one such description. I won a seat not held by my party for 42 years, and I held it in every subsequent election that I fought. I did not win it or retain it by neglecting my constituents. I did not establish a reputation in the House, become a Front-Bench Opposition spokesman, a shadow Secretary of State and, in due course, a Secretary of State by neglecting my parliamentary duties. In those days, we sat for far longer hours&#151;frequently through the night&#151;and we were not provided with the plethora of secretaries and political aides now available. I did not give up my principal outside employment until the last months as the shadow Cabinet prepared for the election we won and for office. As a Minister, like other Ministers, I then had to work harder and for longer hours than I had ever worked before, but I still had to nurse my far-flung constituency and look after my constituents.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09070890000063"></a>Like Mr Frank Field, I strongly oppose a measure that makes a mockery of what he and I thought public service was all about and provides for stopwatches or egg timers to be started every time an MP undertakes anything outside his parliamentary duties. The scheme is preposterous. On the one hand, we are asked to believe that every MP without an outside job is endlessly engaged on political work. Does he or she never enjoy the sun on the Terrace, spend long hours drinking in the bars, watching television in his or her sumptuous offices or just gossiping in the Tea Room? Back in the constituencies where MPs now spend so much time, do they really spend all their time in frantic political activity? I do not believe it, and if they do, it is curious how little many of us observe of those activities.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09070890000064"></a>In the real world, it is virtually impossible to disentangle minute by minute the time spent on each activity. In the days when I had a job in the City, I might have

In the days when I was chairman of the National Rivers Authority, when I was sitting in this House, I was paid on the basis that I would do at least three days&#146; work a week for the authority, I would have found it impossible, though I am quite certain that the NRA got a full three days from its chairman. If the Bill passes, those approximations would be open to challenge and possible penalties. What are lawyers and other professionals to do if they are required to identify their clients and how much they have paid, which would breach their duty of confidentiality? As Mr Dominic Grieve pointed out, that conflict of duties could end up in the European Court of Human Rights. What is the farmer to do or the individual running a small private business? Every time a transaction is completed, it will have to be declared with the gross receipt set out in full and the time devoted to obtaining the contract. The public are never going to know the expenses of running the business or obtaining the contract, so the real net income will not be revealed. Imagine the scene: the farmer sits by the sale ring for most of the morning and buys 20 heifers towards the end of the sale. What has been the time spent? How can it possibly be relevant? Surely, all that is needed is a simple declaration: &#147;I am a farmer&#148;. Already, a significant number of very capable and conscientious Members of Parliament have announced that they are no longer prepared to put themselves and their families through this invasive and humiliating nonsense. I fear that in the future a very large number of able men and women of the kind that we desperately need will come to the conclusion that they too must abandon any thought of serving their country in Parliament. Parliament will be the poorer for it and, more importantly, the people of this country will pay a heavy price. Ironically, one result is likely to be a House containing more of the very rich with private incomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09070890000065"></a>A number of noble Lords referred to the misunderstandings about the privileges of Parliament, many believing that they simply provide protection for a whole lot of cosy rights for Members of Parliament and Lords. The reality is that those privileges are there to protect the most basic rights of the citizen. There are clauses that make changes that go to the very heart of Parliament&#146;s independence and what the Bill of Rights 1689 was all about. There are questions about the ability of individual Members to be treated justly with the proper protection of the law. The report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights is as relevant to our consideration of the Bill as that of the Constitution Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09070890000066"></a>I finish my remarks as I started them, by expressing a sense of outrage at the way in which this Bill is being handled. We must do our best to give it the examination it needs. I hope that my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth&#146;s amendment will be carried. We need to insert a sunset clause to give a new House of Commons the opportunity to carry out wider scrutiny and consultation in order to prepare a Bill more likely to serve the interests of both Parliament and people.</p>

<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_721"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 721</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in Public Life, following Lord Nolan, who is now, sadly, deceased. That committee strongly believed in self-regulation in Parliament. I want to begin with, and take as my leading text, a citation from the learned and able report of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which several speakers have mentioned today and whose chairman, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, entered the Chamber by fortune about three-quarters of an hour ago to hear this eulogistic citation from paragraph 3:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09070890000095"></a>&#147;Parliamentary privilege consists of the rights and immunities which the two Houses of Parliament and their members and officers possess to enable them to carry out their parliamentary functions effectively. Without this protection members would be handicapped in performing their parliamentary duties, and the authority of Parliament itself in confronting the executive and as a forum for expressing the anxieties of citizens would be correspondingly diminished&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070890000091"></a>To summarise, parliamentary privilege exists to protect Members of Parliament and thereby to benefit the public. If, by a Bill such as this, you diminish the House of Commons, you thereby injure the public.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09070890000068"></a>The events that took place in May and June, beginning with the disclosures in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, revealed a terrible situation where the public was angrier with Parliament than one has ever known in one&#146;s life. There was a double whammy, because even when the first shock waves were going through the country, based on what was in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>&#151;its sales, no doubt, soared&#151;a second lot of disclosures came from Parliament, no doubt as a result of the grindingly slow process that started with the defeat of the House of Commons in front of the High Court on 16 May 2008, when the court made an order for full disclosure, albeit subject to redactions, which produced those ludicrous publications with hardly a word or even the name of anybody visible. That was the double whammy, because it showed that, left to themselves, the Members of Parliament operating that system would have liked to reduce the amount of information in the public domain to those limited, unintelligible fragments.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09070890000069"></a>That dire situation called for a response. Should it have been mature, measured and consistent with the privileges and traditions of Parliament or a panic reaction designed to capture some laudatory headline in the tabloids, or even the broadsheets? I am afraid that the Prime Minister made it perfectly clear in what he said on 10 June that the route to be followed was that of panic. Now, in reading this passage I bear in mind what the Leader of the House told us this afternoon: that it is no longer the view of the Prime Minister that this Bill should apply to the House of Lords. I would interpret that to mean that it would not even be a model for a Bill. At the time, however, before the U-turn, the Prime Minister referred to a meeting of &#147;the Government&#146;s democratic council&#148;, which was going to,</p>
<ul><a name="09070890000102"></a>&#147;bring forward ... proposals ... First, we propose that the House of Commons&#151;and subsequently the House of Lords&#151;move from the old system of self-regulation to independent, statutory regulation. That will mean the immediate creation of a new Parliamentary Standards Authority, which will have delegated power to regulate the system of allowances. No more can Westminster operate in ways reminiscent of the last century, whereby Members make up the rules and operate them among themselves&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09070890000092"></a>He went on to refer to other powers that would be given to that authority and added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09070890000096"></a>&#147;I welcome the cross-party support for these proposals&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 10/6/09; col. 796.]</p>

<p><a name="09070890000093"></a>In the inner room, no longer smoke-filled, a deal of some sort was, no doubt, done with the leaders of the parties&#151;foolishly, in my opinion&#151;that it was in the interests of all parties that the Bill should be bustled out with that strong-arm appearance.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09070890000070"></a>If you stand back and think about the situation, you see that it is very grave for the Members of Parliament down the Corridor and, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, pointed out, for their successors, who will soon be here&#151;possibly a 50 per cent different team of men and women. But what was the Prime Minister saying in that passage? It was, surely, that the Members of the House of Commons are not to be treated as fit to regulate their own affairs or to conduct self-regulation. Either that is a condemnation, which will add to the worries expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, and others about what is happening to the morale of Parliament, or it is a pure funk that, in order to please the media, some new, external body must appear and have an authority over the House of Commons that, with such knowledge as I have, I believe is without parallel in parliamentary history.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09070890000071"></a>The Star Chamber was abolished in 1641. It is as if King Charles walked into Parliament in 1643 saying, &#147;Do you know what I&#146;m going to do? I&#146;ve decided that you made a mistake when you abolished the Star Chamber. I&#146;m going to set up a body that is superior to you and can give orders to Members of Parliament on how they are to behave&#148;. That is inconceivable, for Parliament is sovereign; you cannot create a body out there with those powers. In an election, the electorate can get rid of Parliament but not of those other bodies that are superior to Parliament. I submit to your Lordships that the creation of that new, outside body is wholly unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09070890000072"></a>I entirely adopt what the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, said. If you reflect maturely on it, why should you not create a system for self-regulation? You can have any amount of assistance on the financial side. The four great chartered accountancy companies that do all the mega-audits&#151;although they were criticised yesterday, on some grounds that I have forgotten&#151;could be asked, &#147;Will you set up a panel for us, that will immediately&#151;the same day, or the next&#151;review any submission for expense or allowance made by any Member of Parliament?&#148;. That panel could adjudicate on whether the claim had been supported by the mortgage or whichever receipt. You could set up any amount of independent assistance to help to ensure total integrity and remove all opportunities for people to say, &#147;They are up to their tricks, or stealing, or doing things in a sly manner by flipping from one second home to another&#148;. You could eliminate all of that with the greatest of ease, but you do not need to impose that additional, outside body on Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09070890000073"></a>There is a need to look at, with reflection and mature consideration over the vacation or long recess, what system could be put up in place, in light of the forthcoming recommendations from the Committee  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_723"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 723</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on Standards in Public Life, which, as now constituted, has undertaken the role of producing new guidelines. One very much hopes that its guidelines will say, &#147;This is how we ensure integrity on the financial side, and we will make recommendations on a wise way of ensuring that that is complied with&#148;. Then there can be no more criticism of the sort that the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> has carried.</p>

<a name="90708-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09070890000074"></a>I agree, then, with the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, and with other speakers: this approach is completely wrong. It is totally contrary to history. It negates the privileges conferred in 1689; noble Lords may remember the words about there being no interference with the proceedings in any court or any other place. The committee that the Bill creates is another place, where the proceedings in Parliament would be interfered with. Let us get rid of all that and devise a system that is consistent with our history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09070890000077"></a>I wish to make two points. I emphasise the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, about the unnecessariness and deep undesirability of providing for separate criminal offences for Members of Parliament when the existing offences of false accounting and fraud more than cover any relevant misconduct. Furthermore, it is bound to be observed, with proper criticism, that these offences carry much lighter penalties than the common law, which carries seven years and 10 years respectively for those other offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09070890000078"></a>The principle in relation to that aspect and the other point that I wish to make is the same: that Members of Parliament&#151;and, indeed, Members of this House&#151;should be treated, as far as possible, under the law and in relation to laws of taxation and remuneration, like other citizens of this country. It is

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09070890000079"></a>In summary, the system of allowances for second homes in the House of Commons should be abolished. It should be rolled into and paid as part of a fair salary as recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body to cover, as well as normal living expenses, the reasonable needs of Members of Parliament to maintain homes both near Westminster and in or near their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09070890000080"></a>A great deal has been said about our being in hock to the press and I was heartened about three weeks ago to read a leader in the <I>Times</I> that said, broadly, that the expenses for this aspect should be rolled into a salary&#151;as they always, in a sense, had been while they existed&#151;and that there should be an overall taxable salary for these purposes of &#163;90,000. Whether that figure is too high or too low is for the Senior Salaries Review Body and not for us&#151;Parliament will have to consider it and take responsibility&#151;but the principle that we should be treated the same as other citizens would do more to restore confidence than anything else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09070890000081"></a>For those of us who were Members of the other place, the background to the present system is fascinatingly set out in the broadsheet <I>Order, Order!</I>, which former Members of Parliament receive. There is an interesting article by Joe Ashton, the former Labour Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, who was always a gutsy speaker. He is as gutsy today as he was then and he points out the background. It all started in July 1974, between the two elections, when Harold Wilson was faced with a revolt by 150 Members of Parliament. There are former Members of Parliament here who were there then and will know whether Joe Ashton is right or wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09070890000082"></a>Certainly when I came in, five years later, at first I did not claim. I could not quite understand the living away from home allowance and I rented a servant&#146;s room from Lady Airey in Marsham Court, for which I paid &#163;40 a week, and that is what I claimed. I then asked a more experienced old hand in Parliament how it worked and he said, &#147;No, don&#146;t do that; it&#146;s part of your pay&#148;. I then claimed the living away from home allowance for the next 22 years because I believed that that was what every Member of Parliament did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09070890000083"></a>There is nothing party political in this because, although that system may have been started under the Labour Government, it was adopted by Mrs Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair. I am all in favour of openness&#151;I am being fairly open in this speech&#151;but the system began to fall apart when people saw these new kitchens and massive mortgages. It is not satisfactory to have massive mortgages as the only way in which you can get an essential part of your salary. I do not excuse the flipping of homes&#151;it did not happen in those days; I do not think that anyone thought of it&#151;but the complexities of changing tax law to do away with it are, I suspect, much greater than most of us have given our minds to.</p>

One noble Lord of great distinction said to me, when I tried this out on him, &#147;If you make this reform, you will not need this Bill&#148;. To a great extent that may be true, because the other aspects of expenses, such as secretarial and travel allowances, are not difficult to model. Although there have been some fiddles, with people allegedly employing their sons in dubious circumstances and so on, they have not caused a major problem.</p>

<a name="09070894000001"></a><b><a name="90708-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070894000077"></a>Lord Norton of Louth:</b> My Lords, this Bill is introduced on the basis of a false premise. That premise underpins the desire to fast-track the Bill. Given that it is a false premise, it follows that there is no case for expediting the passage of the Bill and setting aside the House&#146;s recommended minimum intervals between the stages of a Bill. I shall argue not only that there is no case for fast-tracking the Bill but also that there are strong&#151;I would suggest compelling&#151;arguments for not fast-tracking it.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09070894000002"></a>The Bill is designed, as we have heard, to help restore public trust in Parliament. Recent months have seen a collapse of confidence in the political class. The problem has not been so much with Parliament as with parliamentarians. There is a widespread perception of a misuse of public funds. The case for expediting the passage of the Bill is that creating an independent parliamentary standards agency to regulate MPs&#146; pay and allowances, and to do so as soon as possible, will help lance the boil of public anger.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09070894000003"></a>This argument fails to grasp the nature of the public anger. As far as the Government are concerned, the crucial point is that the Bill creates an independent body: MPs will not be in control of their own pay and allowances. What this ignores is that the problem is not one solely of public disapproval of how the allowances are being administered; it is the fact of the allowances themselves. They will remain&#151;look at Clause 3. Having an independent body dispersing money to MPs for furniture and mortgages, however independent the body and however rigorous the rules, will not lance the boil of public anger. Believing that this Bill will have such an effect is not only misguided but dangerously so.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09070894000004"></a>Had there been greater discussion, not only within Parliament but with people outside, then this may have been apparent. I draw to the attention of the House the words of Natascha Engel, Labour Member for North-East Derbyshire, during Second Reading in the other place when she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09070894000059"></a>&#147;Until we know what sort of Parliament the people out there want this to be, it will be much more difficult for us to create an appropriate system of remuneration and reimbursement. We have had any number of opportunities to go out and talk to people, but we have failed at every turn&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 29/6/09; col. 92.]</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09070894000005"></a>We are legislating against a background of public anger but without fully appreciating the depth of that anger and what people want Parliament to do.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09070894000006"></a>This brings me to the arguments against expediting the passage of the Bill. Given what I have said, there is no clear case for fast-tracking the Bill. There are, I suggest, three powerful arguments against. An expedited passage will be counterproductive, perverse, and dangerous.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09070894000007"></a>First, fast-tracking the Bill is counterproductive. It would, as some noble Lords have already outlined, reinforce the very condition it seeks to counter; that is, a lack of confidence in parliamentarians. The point has been well expressed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on the Bill. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09070894000060"></a>&#147;We note, with a certain irony, that although the bill is designed to restore public confidence in the House of Commons, it is being rushed into the statute book and will not receive proper scrutiny, as a result. We have been unable to write to the Government to ask for its views on the issues we raise&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070894000008"></a>It is a point developed in the report on the Bill of the Constitution Committee of your Lordships&#146; House, on which I serve. Paragraph 23 of the report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09070894000061"></a>&#147;There is an undoubted need to restore public confidence in the parliamentary system. It is not, however, clear to us that a cobbled together bill rushed through Parliament will help rebuild public trust; on the contrary, if parliament cannot be seen to be scrutinising proposals with the thoroughness they deserve, public confidence in parliamentarians is likely to be further undermined&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09070894000009"></a>Secondly, fast-tracking is perverse, given that the Committee on Standards in Public Life is due to report in the autumn. What if its recommendations&#151;which party leaders have said, in advance, that they will accept&#151;run counter to the provisions of the Bill? The Justice Secretary has claimed that the Bill creates the scheme for pay and allowances and that the committee will fill in the details of the scheme. The committee, justifiably in the light of the Prime Minister's invitation, believes that it is addressing the most appropriate scheme.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09070894000010"></a>This raises an obvious question. It was raised by Professor Dawn Oliver in her evidence to the Justice Committee in the other place. In commenting on Clause 3, she wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09070894000062"></a>&#147;This clause assumes that there will be an allowance scheme. This pre-empts the CSPL recommendations, which might not recommend allowances but flat rated salaries instead&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09070894000011"></a>Flat-rate salaries, as my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell has touched upon, would address the problem probably far more effectively than the provisions of the Bill. The question I put to Government is this: if this Bill becomes law before the recess and the Committee on Standards in Public Life makes recommendations that run counter to its provisions, what then do we do? The party leaders have signed up to implementing the committee's recommendations. Jack Straw appears to believe that the answer is to amend the Act. We enact it before the recess and we amend it in the autumn. Does anyone really believe that this will restore public confidence?</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09070894000012"></a>Thirdly, fast-tracking the Bill is dangerous. This is the most important point. This, as has been so well argued already by noble Lords, is a public Bill with constitutional implications. Those implications have been drawn out in the memorandum of the Clerk of  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_727"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 727</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the House of Commons to the Justice Committee; in the memorandum of the Clerk of the Parliaments to the Constitution Committee of this House; and in the reports of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Constitution Committee. They are also clear from other evidence submitted to the Justice Committee in the other place.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09070894000013"></a>The Bill was hastily drafted and the constitutional implications not fully realised. When some of the implications became apparent, the Government accepted that one clause had to go. Another was removed by a vote of the House, even though there had been no opportunity to debate the clause and no opportunity to take account of its consequences. Indeed, as the Justice Secretary said after the vote and at the very end of Committee stage:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="09070894000063"></a>&#147;I say to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed ... that although we will not be able to do so on Report, we will take full account of the decision of the House in the consequential amendments in the other place".&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 1/7/09; col. 387.]</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09070894000014"></a>So we have to look at the consequences of that change to the Bill. However, we also have to address the constitutional implications of the remaining clauses. The clauses that have been removed in the other place have not shed the Bill of constitutional implications, as we have already heard this afternoon. Anyone who believes that they have should read the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the memorandum of the Clerk of the Parliaments. There was no time in the Commons to consider all the issues raised by the Joint Committee. The chairman, Andrew Dismore, made clear that he expected that his Joint Committee colleagues in this House would pursue amendments similar to those tabled in the other place. In other words, there is a lot to be done on a Bill that, without thorough consideration, may have significant unintended consequences. As the Constitution Committee makes clear, the move towards greater external regulation, as provided for in the Bill, breaks with the principle of &#147;exclusive cognisance&#148; and has the potential, again as we have heard this afternoon, to give rise to conflict between Parliament and the courts.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09070894000015"></a>In the House on Monday evening, I drew attention to the fourth report of the Constitution Committee in the 2001-02 Session on the process of constitutional change. The committee took evidence from the then Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, who made clear that constitutional measures brought forward by government were subject to a rigorous process of preparation within government. He produced a diagram showing the process. He told the committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070894000067"></a>&#147;the devil is in the detail and I can assure you that we do work very intensively&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90708-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09070894000016"></a>This Bill clearly departs from the process detailed by the noble and learned Lord. The devil most certainly is in the detail but there has not been the necessary intensive work prior to introduction. The Constitution Committee yesterday published a report detailing the steps that should be undertaken by government when proposing to fast-track legislation. Those steps have not been followed in respect of this Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_728"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09070894000017"></a>Given that the Bill has not been brought in on the basis of consultation, within government or with anyone outside, and has been rushed through the other place in three days and is demonstrably incomplete, the onus falls on this House to ensure that it is subject to detailed examination. That point has been made by Members of the other place. Like my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew in his excellent speech, I, too, quote Dr Denis MacShane, the Member for Rotherham, during Committee stage of the Bill. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09070894000064"></a>&#147;In my 15 years as a Labour Member of Parliament, who would like an elected second House, I never thought that I would say, as I say tonight, that I hope that the other place takes time and considers the matter carefully&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070894000018"></a>He added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09070894000065"></a>&#147;The concern is cross-party&#151;many of us are talking about the matter in the Tea Room and in the corridors&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 30/6/09; col. 211.]</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09070894000019"></a>The report of the Constitution Committee is clear. Its conclusion could not be more emphatic. It states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070894000068"></a>&#147;we do not think that the case for proceeding with this bill on a fast-track timetable has been established and we do not support any curtailment of the usual legislative timetable&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90708-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09070894000020"></a>I shall later invite the House to support that conclusion. This is a matter not for the political parties but for this House. There is an important principle at stake and I hope very much that the House will agree to uphold it.</p>

<a name="09070894000021"></a><b><a name="90708-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070894000078"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> My Lords, to me, as the 21st speaker in this debate, it seems a long time since we heard the first presentation by the noble Baroness the Leader of the House. However, before I comment briefly on the Bill and pose some questions, I thank her for her presentation of the real situation in which we find ourselves and of why, as she says, the House of Commons needs this Bill. I understand the overall situation. I am also grateful to her for her quite definitive statement of the non-application of provisions similar to this Bill to the House of Lords&#151;although this Bill does not apply to us. That is a very important statement, as it effectively negates earlier statements made by Ministers in recent days, which is important for us in this House.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09070894000022"></a>When I was in the Army, in the Royal Signals, we spent a lot of time repairing equipment and trying to make it as good as new. Then the great day came when we were told that if the product was bust we should simply scrap it and replace it with a new model. I believe that in the present circumstances and in the light of public reaction, the Bill follows the second course, as the intention is to make a really substantive change, as well as to establish a new independent authority to pay the salaries and allowances of Members of the House of Commons, to prepare their allowances scheme and a code relating to their financial interests. I have great sympathy with a recent point made by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. The people are not concerned so much with the creation of some new body as about the existence of the allowance scheme in itself. That is a very important point, and one that we need to concentrate on.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09070894000023"></a>In view of the importance in our political system of the need for Parliament not to cede its powers either to the Government or to another body, one might have  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_729"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 729</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hoped that the House of Commons would keep the final control of the allowance scheme to itself. In the present circumstances, I see that is very difficult. However, I note that the code of conduct relating to financial interests to be prepared by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority does not come into effect until approved by a resolution of the House of Commons. That remaining element of parliamentary control is to be welcomed in that matter.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09070894000024"></a>I have a number of questions. In the debate so far, everyone has expressed an opinion, mostly very strongly, and we have had a whole range of quotations from important committees. In my intervention, I want to pose specific questions to the Government, because what I am interested in is their reaction to these points. We may be very unhappy, but I want to know what they think about them.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09070894000025"></a>First, of course, is the important point about parliamentary privilege. The situation is not the same as it was when the Bill went into the other House. There has been a substantive change in the removal of important clauses from the Bill, including the one headed &#147;Proceedings in the House of Commons&#148;, which was removed without a vote on the amendments but in a vote in the other House. The clause then vanished. It was a rather curious vote, as there was a majority of three and a former Home Secretary and a former Foreign Secretary voted against the Government on that occasion. If you do the mathematics, you can see that it was rather a curious result&#151;but, as the Australians say, &#147;Good on them&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09070894000026"></a>None the less, despite the non-existence of that clause from the original draft, subsequent to that we have the note from the Clerk of the Parliaments&#151;and I am not referring to Dr Jack from the other House. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070894000069"></a>&#147;the juxtaposition of the statutory provisions on paid advocacy contained in the Bill (which will of course be subject to judicial oversight) with the codes covering declaration adopted by the two Houses, which are omitted from the Bill ... could erode the protection offered by Article IX&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09070894000056"></a>that is, the famous Article IX of the Bill of Rights. I know that the Government may find a way around that, but I pose the question to the Leader of the House: what is her reaction to that in relation to the question of parliamentary privilege?</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09070894000027"></a>The second point, the House will be delighted to hear, has not been raised before&#151;so there is one other thing in this Bill that noble Lords will be able to complain about. We understand that the decision to create the Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations was principally because it would avoid the risk that the independent authority might be judge and jury in its own case. That seems quite reasonable, but there are still elements that we need to look at. I ask the Leader of the House to say whether she is satisfied that there will be a clear division between the independent authority and the Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations and that the activity of the independent authority will clearly take account of those points.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09070894000028"></a>I turn to one separate point on this, which is not in the main part of the Bill but in the schedule to the Bill, in paragraph 17(2), which states that:</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_730"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 730</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="09070894000066"></a>&#147;So far as possible the IPSA&#146;s administration functions and its regulation functions must be carried out separately, so that one set of functions does not adversely affect the carrying out of the other&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070894000057"></a>I do not want to make too much of this point, but the phrase &#147;so far as possible&#148; is not very encouraging. It is very important that we should have a proper differentiation of functions in the new proposals.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09070894000029"></a>Thirdly&#151;and this is the most important point that I come on to&#151;there is the question of the extent to which the Bill introduces dangerous proposals that would affect relations between Parliament and the courts. For me, that is the most important point. Will the Leader of the House comment on that specifically? In the text of Clause 7(6), there is written,</p>
<ul><a name="09070894000070"></a>&#147;otherwise, is not to have any legal effect&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070894000058"></a>That is interestingly written, but it is not really the point. The point is that, as indicated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, some elements in this Bill could very easily end up in the courts. He made clear, and I agree, that some of the actions of the independent authority and the commissioner could be covered by that statement&#151;in particular Clause 6(3), which he quoted. That is quite possible, and it is a matter that concerns me. The differentiation of the responsibilities between Parliament and the courts is something to which we need to give attention and respect and not to overtarget in an incidental manner in some other proposal.</p>

<a name="90708-0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09070894000030"></a>That is my third point. Very briefly, I repeat, what about parliamentary privilege, what about the extent to which the independent authority and the commissioner divide their work and what about&#151;a key issue raised by so many Members&#151;relations between Parliament and the courts?</p>

Somebody said of him, &#147;Judging by the silence in the room, Sir Arthur Onslow has just made a joke&#148;, but he produced most of the rules by which the House of Commons was run. He was a man of the utmost integrity and was unbribable in the days of Walpole.</p>

I suggest to your Lordships that only 20 per cent of the Members of the House of Commons have taken the mickey out of the system and 80 per cent of them have not, as was mentioned by one noble Lord. Those 80 per cent are quite entitled to say, as did Clive when surrounded by the treasury of the Siraj-Ud-Daulah, &#147;Gentlemen, I stand astonished at my own moderation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09070894000034"></a>The House of Commons is the foundation of all our liberties. The confidence of the House of Commons, which has made sure that we can all walk as free subjects of the Crown around this country, is something of magic and awe. If Members there lose their bottle and start wandering around with their shoulders hunched and terrified, we will all suffer appallingly for it.</p>

This Bill has been completely and comprehensively destroyed. I do not even need to read the bits that I have marked in these two reports, because they are there. The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, perfectly sensibly said that this problem could be solved by proper structures on the instructions of the House of Commons. It does not need to be outsourced&#151;like being outsourced to a call centre in Bangalore.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09070894000036"></a>I will finish my brief remarks by congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Royall. I say that because when we had our little troubles, she acted immediately and decisively. The Privileges Committee acted immediately and decisively and we suddenly discovered&#151;was it not lovely?&#151;that we had the power to suspend. We had not known that we had it for 800 years but we suddenly found it. She acted with speed and decisiveness and now she has to show a lot of courage. She has to get up at the end of this debate and say&#151;is she listening?</p>

I do not want to be reported to Harriet Harman. She should get up and say, &#147;I have listened. The case for agreeing with what the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, proposes is overwhelming. I am going to go back to the Prime Minister and say, &#145;First Lord of the Treasury, if you want real trouble with the House of Lords this is what you will get. If you want a little co-operation on something which is pretty awful anyway, at least you'll get it if I can do this&#146;&#148;.

<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_732"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 732</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I had in mind have already been said much more effectively than I could have done and have helped to change my own appreciation of this particular Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09070894000042"></a>We have all been shocked over the past few weeks by these expenses revelations and the Commons is shell-shocked by them, which is what has given rise to the Bill, as others have said in different forms. There are two elements to the Bill. One is about expenses. I understand the Commons wants to try to do something about expenses before the Summer Recess starts, even though things are already going to happen during the Recess as consideration is given to what should happen in the future about the salaries and expenses of Members of Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09070894000043"></a>In any case, I am perfectly sure that in practice the expenses regime has already changed a great deal. I am quite sure that Members of Parliament are not claiming things that they would have claimed some months ago. I am also quite sure that the officials of what is now called the House of Commons Department of Resources are being much more careful about the expenses that they agree. I am also quite certain that the audit of what is happening now, which will be done in due course, will be much more rigorous than the previous audit of what was happening. So, as a matter of fact, the expenses regime has already changed a great deal in practice, whatever happens to the Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09070894000044"></a>However, the Bill is also about what to do about the interests of Members of Parliament, and there is no urgency for that. The public have not been bothered about that to any great degree recently. It is a matter of the greatest complexity and anyone who did not understand that only has to read today's proceedings. There is much more that can be said about that, but I will not trouble your Lordships at the moment.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09070894000045"></a>Our excellent Leader of the House said at the beginning of her remarks that this is Commons business and we should let the Commons decide what happens to the Commons in respect of its allowances and so forth. I would have agreed with that until recently, but the fact is that the Commons brought us, your Lordships' House, into this. Things used to be settled with Commons Standing Orders, where we had no locus or role at all. The setting up of the present commissioner and so forth was all dealt with under Commons Standing Orders. Now it is proposed that it should all be done by statute law. That means both Houses of Parliament are involved in deciding what should be in statute law. There is also the danger of bringing in the courts. A lot has been said about that, to which I do not need to add this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09070894000046"></a>The Commons has brought us into this, and this afternoon's debate has amply demonstrated that the Committee and Report stages will take a long time to settle. There is already a raft of amendments down before we even start our consideration&#151;some of the greatest importance. We have heard enough this afternoon to know that it will all take a very long time. The very least that the Leader of the House needs to do when she winds up is to set out in detail the timetable that she now proposes we should follow. The very short timetables that have so far been suggested do not seem in the least adequate. Perhaps that will mean that we do not start the Recess as soon as we thought we

Perhaps it will mean that we interrupt the Recess to come back to consideration of the Bill after a lull; or perhaps it will mean that we return to the matter after the Recess. It is unfortunate that the Recess is upon us because it adds to the difficulties of public presentation and, for that matter, of the consideration of the issues involved.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09070894000047"></a>We have been greatly assisted by the very fast and excellent work of the Constitution Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Justice Committee. We have been greatly assisted by their fast work. I have no doubt that your Lordships will give great attention to the detail in the Bill but we need to know what the future is for both parts of the Bill; the part that deals with expenses and the part that deals with Members&#146; interests, which is much the more complicated and over which there is no urgency at all.</p>

As last man in, if I can push a few singles past mid-off in a short period, I shall be more than happy. We all appreciate that two or three months ago a bombshell exploded. In consequence of that, one of the greatest parliamentary scandals of all time has occurred. It may not be, by a long way, the worst scandal that has occurred in the history of Parliament, but its effect is probably the most injurious development in at least the last 100 years&#151;and possibly the last 200&#151;in the life of Parliament. It is against that background that we must consider this issue.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09070894000049"></a>In such circumstances, any Government would immediately say to themselves, &#147;What must we do?&#148;. There was a case for immediacy and the Government have acted with immediacy, but immediacy means different things. Immediacy means the immediate acceptance of the problem, commitment to dealing with it and setting up of proper institutions to make that possible. Immediacy does not mean an immediate problem, an immediate answer and immediate legislation. That, I think, is exactly where the Government fail. They fail probably not on account of their faults but on account of their virtues&#151;by believing that it was somehow possible to conjure a complete, wise and Solomonic solution to the dreadful situation that is now upon us. It is not a situation that can be met with logic because public anger does not operate logically. Public anger can very often be brought about by the very measures that we would impose on ourselves in this connection.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09070894000050"></a>What should the Government have done? They should have set up the most rigorous inquiry into exactly what has happened and how it started. There have been very candid contributions from the noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Jenkin. Whether it started exactly on their watch or earlier does not matter. It started some time in the last 30 years. It is what might be called the nettle problem&#151;the failure to grasp a nettle that was there. The nettle was the realisation that practically every other Parliament in western Europe paid anything up to twice as much as British Members of Parliament were receiving. It was, happily, just after the time when the electorate released  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_734"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 734</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>me from Parliament. MPs very properly went to their masters and said, &#147;Raise our salaries&#148;. They were told, &#147;It is not possible but we will think of a few alternatives, provided you are reasonable about them&#148;. That was the beginning of it all.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09070894000051"></a>In addition to that examination, there should have been an examination of all the possible alternatives, to meet not only substantially, but psychologically, the anger that has now built up in the public against Parliament. All those alternatives should have been considered and, after that, there should have been the fullest consultation. I do not mean consultation between party leaders, which is sometimes rather conspiratorial, but consultation with the public. It is, after all, their Parliament and it is right that they should feel involved in dealing with the problem and, indeed, the whole issue. Then&#151;and only then&#151;should a draft Bill have been prepared. Once that Bill was prepared, it should have gone to one place, namely the Constitution Committee, for the most rigorous scrutiny that a Bill has ever had. We have done none of these things and have done the exact opposite. I say &#147;we&#148;, taking responsibility&#151;corporately, as a member of the community&#151;for what the Government have done.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09070894000052"></a>The noble Baroness the Leader of the House, for whom I&#151;like every other Member of the House&#151;have profound admiration and respect, tells us that this is not a Bill that in any way involves this House. That, of course, is technically true, but it is a Bill that massively affects and involves this House, which is exactly what we must consider. I accept what is now said about the intention to tag this House on to the Bill. Indeed, there is nothing in Clause 1 that refers specifically to the House of Commons. It could refer to both Houses. Be that as it may, I accept completely that there will be no tagging on now, nor indeed&#151;as the noble Baroness the Leader of the House says&#151;until there is some change in the constitution of this House. I suppose that must be many, many years hence.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09070894000053"></a>Nevertheless, there will still be effects on the House as the upper Chamber of Parliament. There is bound to be an effect on its relationship with the courts. We have had the benefit of the most erudite and valuable opinion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf; we must accept him at his word. One of two things will occur. If the Bill remains as it is now drafted, there will be a flood of applications for judicial review. If that right is removed a very gross misjudgment will have been made, and a very gross injustice will have been imposed on those Members of Parliament. There may be halfway houses between the two situations. It is far too late at night to consider them now, but they are extremely complicated and each has its counterdifficulties.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09070894000054"></a>So, what are we to do? I agree completely with everything that has been said by the noble Lord with regard to the amendment. It seems to me that the whole issue can be distilled to one question. Does anybody in the House not believe that, if the House&#151;in dealing with this Bill of crucial constitutional significance, in the full glare of public contempt and anger&#151;is able to avoid its responsibility of scrutinising the Bill line by line and word by word, the House will have abrogated its right to existence as a Second Chamber? That is the whole issue as far as the timing is concerned. How it is  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_735"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 735</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>overcome is not all that important. It may be done by delaying the matter until the end of the summer vacation. It may be done by spending practically the whole of the period that we have left until 21 July on the Bill. It may be done by delaying the vacation by a few weeks. It matters not. If we fail to do it, we will have betrayed the very best interests of this place. If we do it, I believe that we will have properly earned a substantial measure of public respect.</p>

<a name="90708-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09070894000055"></a>I mention a very narrow legal point that has already been alluded to by many noble Lords; namely, the offences section and the proposal that Members of Parliament responsible for abuses in relation to expenses claims should be dealt with in a particular way. This is not at all a case of double-banking and unnecessarily creating an offence. The offences are contained in Section 17 of the Theft Act 1968&#151;the offence of falsification of accounts&#151;and in Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006. The major point to remember is that the wording of those offences, in the Theft Act and in the Fraud Act, is almost identical to the wording of the offence in subsection (1) of the relevant clause. This means therefore that the elements of those three offences are exactly the same. There is not the slightest necessity or justification for this subsection. Why was it introduced and what will its message be? Its message is this: whereas ordinary citizens who commit these fraudulent offences are liable to 10 years&#146; maximum imprisonment under the Fraud Act, and seven years&#146; imprisonment under the Theft Act, there will be a very tame and limited tariff of one year&#146;s imprisonment, or six months or 12 months in the magistrates&#146; court depending on whether that matter arose before or after the Criminal Justice Act 2003. That will be seen not as trying to lay better standards for Members of Parliament but treating them in a way in which the ordinary member of the public is not treated.</p>

However, I have had experience in the other place as shadow leader of the Commons for some eight years. During that time I made a great many friends and had many contacts with Members on all sides. As the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, properly said, many Members on all sides of that House are looking to us to save them from themselves. It would be an illusion if we were to expect and accept that this House must somehow just rubber-stamp what has happened in the other place. I shall come back to that point in a moment.</p>

Anyone who works anywhere near this place, be they the most senior parliamentarian or a temporary contractor, knows that the mere mention of where we work gives rise at the moment to howls of derision. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry of Southwark, used those words. It is a serious problem and we should not in any way underestimate that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="090708109000003"></a>The public simply do not understand, or accept, that MPs or Members of your Lordships' House should be solely responsible for setting their own pay and conditions. Very few members of the public set their own salaries and still fewer can claim expenses underwritten by the honour of their signature alone rather than by the presence of a receipt. People are understandably urging that Parliament should meet the same standards as the people for whom we legislate. However, this is the dilemma: Parliament is sovereign. Deciding things is what Parliament does, so it is quite difficult to make laws to stop it deciding things. That is the centre of the dilemma which this Bill is all about. It is going to be very difficult to find a way in which Parliament can legislate so that it no longer has any say on this issue. For one thing, what will be the budget of the IPSA and who will set it? Is it not the primary responsibility of the House of Commons to be responsible for &#147;supply&#148;&#151;for money? That is what it is for and has been for many centuries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="090708109000004"></a>The Government, and in a sense the whole political establishment, are acting as though this is a new problem. That is why we are told that this is emergency legislation with special procedures. But this problem is, of course, not new. It is a pitiful situation in which we now find ourselves&#151;the proverbial bulls lumbering around the china shop, with a piece of poorly drafted, ill thought-out legislation. I have not yet heard anyone say this afternoon or this evening that this Bill is in a proper form to go on to the statute book. As has already been said&#151;legislate in haste, repent at leisure. It was ironic that on the very same day that the Commons could not find time to have a Third Reading of this Bill, a Bill was brought before that House to amend the Dangerous Dogs Act. I think that others have referred to this Bill as the Dangerous Politicians Act on the same basis; namely, that it is a knee-jerk and inadequate reaction.</p>

All of us are here to do our job, and our job is to try to make sure that what returns to the other place is a great deal better than the Bill that has come to us. We simply cannot attempt to make an inadequate response to the critical situation we face. The Bill that leaves this House has to be seen as a great improvement on what we have at the moment, even if that is achieved through very drastic surgery.

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="090708109000021"></a>Clause 4, which provides for IPSA to pay for claims, raises an important question. Presumably the authority will have a budget equal to the sum of all MPs&#146; allowances. What if MPs decide in the Finance Bill to increase or reduce that budget? What would happen then? What would happen to the underspend? None of these issues is clear.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="090708109000022"></a>I turn to the issue of parliamentary privilege, with which a great number of Members have been concerned this afternoon&#151;and rightly. I was, in common with the noble Lord, Lord Neill, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls, a member of that Joint Committee on parliamentary privilege, reporting in 1999. That was a decade ago. The committee&#146;s recommendations have never been followed through by the Government.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="090708109000023"></a>The Bill originally, in the other place, encroached on an important element of parliamentary privilege; the right to expect that proceedings in Parliament should not be used as evidence in a court of law. The House of Commons&#151;rather rarely&#151;showed some teeth in defence of that principle, and voted the clause down. But the Bill still leaves a big gap. One of the Joint Committee&#146;s central recommendations was that there should be a parliamentary privilege Act, to define&#151;and therefore limit&#151;what privileges are conferred on Parliament. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, told our committee:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="090708109000129"></a>&#147;The term &#145;privilege&#146; is, I think, plainly unfortunate, although hallowed by long usage. It wrongly suggests some perk or special right or dignity, which certain office-holders enjoy, when attention should be concentrated on the limited exemption from the ordinary law which the effective performance of a public duty requires&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="090708109000024"></a>That has been a constant thread in our debate today. As the Bill stands, even with the exclusion of the previous Clause 10, this is still a problem. My noble friend Lord Lester has set out very properly the concerns that have been already reported from the Joint Committee on Human Rights about proper process and fairness. Those too have not been properly addressed. It is a real concern to all Members, on all sides of the House, whatever they think about the timetable for this Bill, that we make sure that it is not just going to be a very temporary Bill, with all the weaknesses that  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_739"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 739</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that would entail; and that it is going to stand at least the test of time until we are able to give it&#151;with a sunset clause, which again I strongly support&#151;a reconsideration.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="090708109000025"></a>Can the Leader of the House give some indication of what the Government intend to do about parliamentary privilege? It is left in abeyance at the moment&#151;in limbo. It is a real problem, but so too are the issues raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Due process and right of appeal surely have to be built into any procedures to ensure that there are guarantees of fairness.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="090708109000026"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, pointed out; the 18th report of the House of Lords Constitution Committee, which reported today with admirable timing, has indicated that there are real problems with the section of the Bill dealing with offences.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="090708109000027"></a>In paragraph 39, the report says that it is,</p>
<ul><a name="090708109000133"></a>&#147;noteworthy that while the maximum sentence for the Fraud Act offences is 10 years imprisonment only 12 months is proposed for the new offences created by the bill. We do not support the retention in the bill of provisions creating criminal offences applicable to members only when offences in the general criminal law already adequately cover the misconduct in question&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90708-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="090708109000028"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has just said, it would look from that as if the general public, in committing a fraud offence, have to be subjected to a much more formidable sentence than Members of the other place. That surely will do nothing to encourage reconnection between the people and Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="090708109000029"></a>In the other place, Mr Jack Straw said of Section 8,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="090708109000130"></a>&#147;There is a difference between what is in section 2 of the Fraud Act and what is in this provision, not least in that in the Act one of the components of fraud is dishonesty, while in the Bill it is knowingly making a false statement&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons,<I></I>29/6/02; col. 46.]</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="090708109000030"></a>I am no lawyer, but knowingly making a false statement sounds to me to be pretty dishonest. Playing games of that sort seems to be not very helpful when we are trying to encourage greater trust in Parliament and parliamentary proceedings among the general public.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="090708109000031"></a>I will not attempt to go into some of the other inadequacies of the Bill. The point that I have to make to your Lordships&#146; House&#151;it has been made so often this afternoon and this evening&#151;is that we have a responsibility to make sure that what comes to us goes away again in a better form than it came.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="090708109000032"></a>I do not believe that simply delaying matters meets that point. What I certainly believe very strongly indeed is that the process that we are setting up for the other place has implications for your Lordships&#146; House as well.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="090708109000033"></a>Many Members have taken great heart from the statement made by the Leader of the House that the Prime Minister has undertaken a U-turn at some speed&#151;U-turns at speed have very dangerous implications as we all know&#151;and that he has given instructions to other members of the Cabinet that this Bill should no longer apply to your Lordships&#146; House. I take that as a perfectly proper way to listen to Parliament, but it has implications for your Lordships&#146; House.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_740"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 740</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="090708109000034"></a>Clearly, anything that has implications for parliamentary privilege does not just address the situation at the other end of the building; it addresses your Lordships&#146; House too. This Bill has such implications.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="090708109000035"></a>It will be said, sooner rather than later, that the arrangements for the other place in terms of setting and deciding allowances&#151;&#147;outsourced&#148; was the word that one of your Lordships&#146; used&#151;should apply to your Lordships&#146; House as well. There are implications; and we would all be behaving like a herd of noble ostriches, if we felt that there was nothing in this Bill that could affect your Lordships&#146; House. The dangerous situation with ostriches is that they tend to get bitten in a very uncomfortable place.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="090708109000036"></a>It has already been pointed out by a number of noble Lords speaking in this debate that the Clerk of the Parliaments has drawn attention to this issue. We must take very seriously indeed what he says to us. Surely the time will come&#151;it might not be immediately, but it will come&#151;when, if this Bill goes through in its present form, or anything like its present form, there will be direct implications for your Lordships&#146; House as well. Some would say that that is right and proper. Some would say that our present arrangements are as lamentable and as indefensible as those of the Commons. I do not necessarily take that view, but certainly there will be those who question that. Therefore, if the Bill reaches the statute book in its present form, it will have implications for us.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="090708109000037"></a>If we take at face value what the Leader of the House has told us this afternoon, the title of the Bill&#151;the short title as well as long title&#151;is a now a misnomer. This is not a Parliamentary Standards Bill if it is set out now that it is not going to apply to one half of Parliament; it is the House of Commons independent standards authority that we are legislating for. That, surely, is what should be on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="090708109000038"></a>We are in a difficult situation, which is not entirely of the Government&#146;s making&#151;of course we recognise that; some of us would blame the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>. It should have done the job much earlier. However, we have a problem with the onset of the Recess. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, said that he had been reassured on a number of occasions by his Front Bench that the urgency was self-evident. What is self-evident from all the speeches on all sides of the House is that this Bill is nowhere near the satisfactory form which would meet even the objectives of the Government, let alone the deep-seated concerns of Members of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="090708109000040"></a>My noble friend Lord MacGregor set a marvellous standard for the rest of the debate, effectively opening it for our side. He does not speak often in your Lordships&#146; House these days, but as a Cabinet Minister  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_741"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 741</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in another place he spoke frequently. It was quite obvious to those who listened to him in those days that he has lost none of his oratorical skills.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="090708109000041"></a>I return to the noble Baroness&#146;s nimble tread. She said two things which I regard as germane to the issues in front of us. First of all, she said that there are no circumstances in which this Bill will affect the House of Lords&#151;despite the remarks made at an earlier stage by the right honourable gentlemen the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Justice. However, as my noble friend Lord Crickhowell and the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, observed, does her statement also mean that the Bill will not be used as a model for your Lordships&#146; House? I hope that the noble Baroness will deal with that matter in her reply; but I should say now that if it is to be made a model for what is to come to your Lordships&#146; House, that underlines even more heavily the importance of the quality of scrutiny we give to the Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="090708109000042"></a>The noble Baroness also said that we have a responsibility to let the other place have the Bill it wants. A number of your Lordships have commented on that statement. I wish also to say a few words about it. My first observation is: has the other place had a proper opportunity to find out what it really wants, given the time that was accorded to its debates? Secondly, as a number of your Lordships said&#151;particularly the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong&#151;this is future legislation. We are constitutionally a part of the legislative process. We have to take into account the interests, not just of another place but of Parliament. Therefore, it is perfectly right that we give the Bill proper scrutiny, particularly given that it affects many fundamental principles that go to the heart of our constitutional arrangements.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="090708109000043"></a>However, perhaps as good a reason as any for our dealing with this Bill is that it has come to your Lordships&#146; House in what has been described by more than one Member of another place &#147;as a mess&#148;. As a consequence of the removal of two crucial clauses&#151;Clauses 6 and 10&#151;many of the provisions make no sense at all. We, in a sense, are trustees for the clarity of the Bill, as well as its content.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="090708109000044"></a>Many of your Lordships have talked about the process. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Goodlad for the extraordinary speed with which his committee has produced two excellent reports, both of which have made some excoriating remarks about the way that this matter has been handled.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="090708109000045"></a>The noble Baroness quite rightly drew our attention to the public anger about the question of allowances and expenses in another place. She was quite right in saying that this needs a prompt response. However, I discern from the debate that there is a deep division about what the character of that response should be. We have one kind of response in the Bill&#151;which is IPSA and all the panoply of a statutorily independent body&#151;but, on the other hand, other solutions have been proposed. The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, presented a perfectly plausible alternative for dealing with this matter.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="090708109000046"></a>Moreover, as my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth said, what is here as regards the expenses arrangement is simply a framework. What will be poured into that framework depends on an entirely different body, quite outside your Lordships&#146; House,  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_742"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which is the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Until we know what its recommendations are, which we will not get until the autumn, we will not know to what use this framework will be put. That went to the core of what my noble friend Lord Norton was saying.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="090708109000047"></a>The other part of the Bill, with respect, does not merit urgent treatment&#151;the question of financial interests. That is the part of the Bill that concerns the Opposition the most. There is no evidence that the question of financial interests needs urgent treatment. There was a crisis in the other place in the mid-1990s, which is best encapsulated in the words &#147;brown envelopes&#148;. We recently had our own difficulties, as your Lordships will recall. In my submission, both those issues were handled extremely well by the internal arrangements of both Houses. I should be very surprised if we have similar crises of that sort in the foreseeable future. Both in another place and in your Lordships&#146; House the internal procedures were wholly adequate to deal with these matters.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="090708109000048"></a>Moreover, the kind of arrangements on the face of the Bill, with respect to financial interests, will worsen the problems, as was so brilliantly described by my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon as well as by other noble friends and other noble Lords. We have been concerned in your Lordships&#146; House for a very long time about the increasing professionalism of another place. We have been concerned, as my noble friend Lord MacGregor said, about the decreasing number of Members of another place who have skills outside the purely political ones. The provisions in this Bill will worsen that situation profoundly, and for that reason are wholly misplaced.</p>

I have found, when I have responded to similar questions from him in previous debates, that I have rarely satisfied him. However, I will put the questions to the noble Baroness at a later stage in my remarks. I hope that that will suffice.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="090708109000051"></a>I will say something about constitutional issues. The best way to do this is to draw your Lordships&#146; attention to certain provisions of the Bill. First, there is the question of the relationship between Parliament and the courts. This has been managed very satisfactorily ever since the Act of Settlement. There has been a constitutional understanding that the courts will not interfere with parliamentary procedures and Parliament will not interfere with the procedures of the courts.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="090708109000052"></a>That balance, which is one of constitutional convention, is now threatened. A good example of this is the enforcement provision in Clause 7(2)&#151;a provision to which both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, have drawn our attention. The provision states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="090708109000132"></a>&#147;The IPSA may recommend to the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges that the House should exercise any of its disciplinary powers in relation to a member of the House&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="090708109000053"></a>Until now, the arrangements that have been in place since 1995 have never been questioned in any court of law. The commissioner for standards, who has been put in place to examine any complaint about a Member of another place, has conducted his proceedings, reached his conclusions and made his recommendations while acting as part of another place, and therefore being protected by the provisions of Clause IX of the Bill of Rights. Will that still be the case? The Bill requires IPSA to recommend to the Committee on Standards and Privileges certain actions as a result of its investigation. It is clear that the recommendation will be capable of being judicially reviewed by a court. Will the ability of the court to judicially review extend to the decision of the Committee on Standards and Privileges?</p>

The problem is that if whatever machinery is set up is punitive or determines civil rights and obligations, there must be an independent and impartial tribunal to deal with the matter, or else we will be&#151;as the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privileges said 10 years ago&#151;in trouble under the convention.

Now that the noble Baroness has underlined that she has made that concession, I will not trouble the House on the matter any further. It is an important concession from the Government, and I thank her for it.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="090708109000062"></a>It is also crucial to change the offences provisions under Clause 8. We on the committee will seek to expunge the whole of Clause 8. There are three offences. We need not trouble ourselves any further about Clause 8(3), because now that Clause 10 has been removed from the Bill, it would be impossible to use parliamentary proceedings as evidence in court, and therefore impossible to establish a prosecution case against any Member of Parliament.</p>

<a name="90708-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="090708109000063"></a>The other two provisions remain. The first one has been spoken to by a number of noble Lords, in particular by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I respectfully agree with their conclusions. It is clear that the matter is covered by Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006. Therefore it is unnecessary to have a provision that mirrors it in Clause 8(1), particularly since the provision only carries with it a sentence of imprisonment for one year, whereas Section 2 of the Fraud Act carries a sentence of 10 years. It will be suggested by the public that, by inserting Clause 8(1), the Government are trying to set a much lighter penalty for Members than for the public. That would be highly dangerous&#151;I am delighted to see that the noble Baroness is nodding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="090708109000068"></a>The remaining offences come under Clause 8(2), which refers to failures with respect to the financial register. This is a completely counterproductive defence. You cannot have an offence under Clause 8(2) until the financial rules have been legislated for. Who legislates for the financial rules? IPSA decides what these rules, which are about to become criminal, are. It then sends them to another place, which endorses them by a Motion and they become the law of the land. What an extraordinary way to make criminal law. In effect, it is not Parliament&#151;involving both Houses and the Crown&#151;that is making the criminal law, but IPSA. Once it establishes the financial rules, the only thing that another place can do is to endorse them&#151;it cannot even amend them. That cannot be constitutionally right and I urge the Government to withdraw the whole of Clause 8.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="090708109000075"></a>Before I address many of the points of detail which have been raised this evening, I would just like to recall the points of principle on which I think most of us can agree. I believe that there is a clear public desire for reform of arrangements in the House of Commons. Given the public&#146;s legitimate concerns about the conduct of members in the other House, I think it is incumbent upon this House to act decisively and to build on the interim measures that the other place has already introduced.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="090708109000076"></a>I think that we can probably agree on the following fundamental points. First, the current system in the Commons for allowances and expenses must be replaced. We eagerly await Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s recommendations and this is the Bill that will provide the formal structure to put those recommendations into practice. Secondly, a minimum requirement of the administration of the allowances and expenses system is that it should be subject to effective, independent scrutiny. Thirdly, it is important for securing renewed public trust that the House of Commons code of conduct on financial interests should be drawn up and overseen by an independent body. I know that that last point is slightly controversial but I think many people in this House would agree on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="090708109000077"></a>I will respond to many of the points made in today&#146;s debates. I have to say that I too am not a lawyer. I will do my utmost but I will also from time to time rely on Box notes. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, made a superb opening speech and as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, he set the tone of the debate and I am very grateful for that. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, referred to Mr Alan Duncan in the other place and the concerns he expressed, and he quoted him saying that the Bill must be right&#151;that we cannot get it wrong. I acknowledge that there is still a great deal of work to be done on this Bill, but in my view the very fact that all the noble Lord&#146;s colleagues in the other place voted in favour of this Bill at Second Reading, and that they did not press the issue to a vote at Third Reading, means that Mr Duncan is content that this Bill is broadly right.</p>

I can assure her, and I have actually talked to some Members of the other place this afternoon who have been very anxious to make this point, that the fact that they did not vote at Third Reading does not mean that they are happy with the Bill. Many Members in the other place&#151;including, I have been told, Members of her own party&#151;want substantial changes and are looking to this House to make them.</p>

I suggest respectfully that in future if Members of the other place want to vote then they should vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="090708109000080"></a>The noble Lord raised the issue of MPs and outside interests, as have many other noble Lords this evening, including the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. Nothing in this Bill prevents a Member of Parliament having an outside interest but it does stipulate that those interests must be registered, as they are at present, in order that there is no ambiguity about an MP&#146;s motives for raising an issue when he or she is in the Chamber. I personally think that is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="090708109000081"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, for confirming the intense nature of the cross-party talks. There has been much discussion this evening, or much innuendo, about the cross-party agreements and this, that and the other. There were intensive discussions between the parties and I believe that they were very fruitful. The Bill that we have before us, with all its imperfections, is the result of those cross-party talks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="090708109000082"></a>I am now going to deal up front with the sunset clause, which was first raised by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, and then by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and others. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has either tabled, or is going to table, an amendment asking that there be a sunset clause. I think it would be improper for there to be a sunset clause which covered the whole of the Bill. It would be difficult to set up a new authority to advertise for people to be employed by this new authority without giving them security of employment and, indeed, without allowing this authority to start its work. I recognise however that some clauses could, and perhaps should, be revisited in a period of perhaps two years. I therefore suggest that we come

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="090708109000083"></a>The noble Lord raised the pay of MPs. Of course I should clarify that this Bill will not alter the existing arrangements for sitting MPs&#146; pay. It is determined by the SSRB and approved by the Commons, and IPSA will only administer the payment of salaries.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="090708109000084"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, who I know cannot be in his place, and many other noble Lords suggested that the Bill was premature and that we should wait until Sir Christopher Kelly and his committee had reported. I stress again that this Bill provides a structural framework. Sir Christopher and his committee will provide the substance, and I believe it is entirely appropriate that the authority should be set up, with the chair and committee being appointed, while we await the report from Sir Christopher. As I said in my opening remarks, I believe that this is important for Members of the other place now and it is vital that everything is up and running and embedded before the next election so that the MPs who are elected to the next Parliament can get on with their work without having any more of these arguments and discussions about pay and allowances.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="090708109000085"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and many others, including the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, asked whether the Bill would upset the balance between the courts and Parliament. We do not believe that the Bill is incompatible with Article 9 of the Bill of Rights. It makes no specific provision to disapply Article 9 and will not change the relationship between Parliament and the courts. A court faced with a judicial review of IPSA functions would not be able to consider proceedings in Parliament, as that would not be possible under Article 9.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="090708109000086"></a>Many noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked why we should create a separate criminal offence in respect of allowances applicable just to MPs when we already have a criminal offence that would apply. Providing false information on a claim under the allowances scheme could amount to conduct already caught by an existing offence&#151;that is, fraud by false representation under the Fraud Act 2006. However, this would be dependent on whether the elements of this offence were made out. A prosecution for fraud requires additional proof beyond reasonable doubt of dishonest intent and proof that the purpose was to make a financial gain. Fraud is a more serious offence which carries a greater maximum penalty than that envisaged in the Bill, which, as many noble Lords have said, requires only knowingly providing false information. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, says and I note the amendments that he has tabled. Before Committee, I shall certainly reflect on his suggestion to get rid of the whole of Clause 8. However, of course I cannot make any concessions here at the Dispatch Box and it would not be right for me to do so.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="090708109000087"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, for his excellent reports. They have of course caused me and the Government enormous problems but I still believe that they are excellent. I especially pay tribute to his report on fast-tracked legislation, which I hope will

Of course, I disagree with his view that the Bill will not enhance public support. I believe that it will because the public are frustrated with what is going on and they do not understand the niceties of our debates and our scrutiny. They want good legislation but they want action, and this Bill provides us with that.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="090708109000088"></a>I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, for earlier giving me a copy of his document written in 2000. I always listen to him very carefully due to his vast experience, and I wholeheartedly agree that Members of both the Commons and the Lords should give obedience to the unenforceable. However, that has patently not been happening, and that is why we have this Bill before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="090708109000089"></a>My noble friend Lord Peston and others referred to the Statement of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice. In his concluding remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also went back to the question of whether the Bill would ever be applicable to the Lords. Again, I categorically state that this Bill will not be used as a model for your Lordships&#146; House, and there is no intention of this or any similar Bill applying to this House. We will not apply this legislation to this House. Having said that, I add that what I say at this Dispatch Box cannot bind future Parliaments, but that is the view of this Government. I am being honest with your Lordships.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="090708109000090"></a>My noble friend Lord Peston referred to the Constitution Committee&#146;s reports, which, as I said, are excellent. He, like the committee, suggested that the Bill should not be fast-tracked and he referred to deals and stitch-ups. As I said, there were no deals; the position arrived at was consensual.</p>

I think that what I said on behalf of the Select Committee was that it would be counterproductive in terms of influencing public opinion if it were given inadequate time for consideration.</p>

The noble Lord proposed that there should be a tribunal. My note says that the IPSA, an independent body in itself, with a former judge as a member, has limited powers. It can make a direction to repay an allowance or update the register, or it can recommend additional sanctions to the Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges. Enforcement is left to the House of Commons and the Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges. That means that enforcement will not happen without the House of Commons saying so. We have committed to considering whether the commissioner should simply make a finding of fact so that he has even fewer functions. However, I undertake to look into the proposal made by the noble Lord that there should be a tribunal.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="090708109000102"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, referred to the word &#147;privilege&#148;. This might seem a silly point but, like him and so many others in this House, I deeply regret that the word brings with it so many misconceptions. That is one of our problems. It is a hugely important concept and it is a right that protects parliamentarians and, through parliamentarians, their constituents. Like all noble Lords, I am concerned about that.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="090708109000103"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, that we have to do something to confront the evils facing the House of Commons. I listened to his proposals with care but I believe that the Bill helps to confront some of those evils.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="090708109000104"></a>I understand the view of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, that we should rescue the Commons from itself. I believe that this Bill is what the Commons wants. The hard-working Members of the other place are suffering from the terrible opprobrium that has fallen on them and their families in the past weeks. They know far better than we do how ghastly it has been and what needs to be done.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="090708109000105"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, that hindsight is wonderful. I agree that action should have been taken earlier, but that is easy for us to say now. When he talks about the dominance of this Government, I respectfully remind him that his own Government were dominant for 18 years.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="090708109000106"></a>To my noble friend Lord Barnett I say that this is not a response to the media. It is a response to the concern of the public that may have been engendered   


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_750"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 750</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the media. A little flame was ignited and, now that that public flame is there, we have to do our best to deal with it.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="090708109000107"></a>I have huge respect for the noble Baroness, Lady Perry of Southwark, and I completely agree that most Members of Parliament are upright, hard-working men and women. They work their socks off for their constituents. However, I do not agree that the public concern is temporary. Public life has changed fundamentally and we have a duty to deal with the situation as we find it now.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="090708109000108"></a>Of course, I agree with the view of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that scrutiny is needed. I note his views about the reporting chain from the commissioner to IPSA and to the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I undertake to look at that carefully, as I will the many other issues raised by the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="090708109000109"></a><b><a name="90708-0012.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="090708109000389"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness mentioned the Committee on Standards in Public Life; I mentioned the Committee on Standards and Privileges.</p>

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="090708109000110"></a><b><a name="90708-0012.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="090708109000390"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I was ill reading my words. Forgive me. I know exactly what the noble Lord was referring to.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="090708109000111"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, asked whether IPSA and the commissioner would not be able to perform their functions because the provision on privilege in the Bill as introduced disapplied privilege to permit IPSA and the commissioner to perform their functions. The prohibition on questioning proceedings in Parliament in Article IX of the Bill of Rights applies to,</p>
<ul><a name="090708109000134"></a>&#147;any court or place out of Parliament&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090708109000127"></a>Neither IPSA nor the commissioner is a court. &#147;Place out of Parliament&#148; should not be taken literally. It obviously does not prevent newspapers or the public from commenting on Parliament. In 1999, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege stated that &#147;place out of Parliament&#148; includes tribunals where witnesses give evidence on oath but not non-statutory tribunals or inquiries.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="090708109000112"></a>I note the views expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate, about the need for salaries to be increased to take account of second home expenses. I am sure that the other place will come back to that, but that is a matter for it.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="090708109000113"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, said about the nature of the public anger that it is the allowances themselves, not the way in which they are administered, that is important. Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s committee is looking at the allowances, but the Bill is necessary to provide the structure so that, when the new allowances system is brought in, it can be implemented in the best possible way.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="090708109000114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, posed a number of questions. I shall answer just one of them. Yes, the Bill carefully separates the functions of IPSA and those of the commissioner. Both IPSA and the commissioner have their functions conferred separately on them. They are established separately. The only link is a duty on IPSA adequately to resource the commissioner. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 is about  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_751"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column 751</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>separating the administrative functions of IPSA&#151;for example, setting the allowances scheme. I will respond to the noble Lord in writing.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="090708109000115"></a>To the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, I say that I have no illustrious ancestors. I bought all my own furniture. I came from peasant stock and mining stock, but my stock were also men and women of integrity. They, like me, had a sense of history. Like the noble Earl, when I come into this place, I feel that it is a very special place. Because I feel that it is a special place, and because this Parliament belongs to the ancestors of both of us, and to the people of this country, who are so angry, we have a duty to deliver a Bill that will help to promote understanding and assuage that deep anger.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="090708109000116"></a>I agree with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Cope, said about the excellent work of the Constitution Committee and I assure him that I have listened throughout the debate.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="090708109000117"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that nobody thinks that this is a total solution. This is part of the solution, along with Sir Christopher Kelly&#146;s committee, the work by Sir Thomas Legg and many other things that are now being implemented in the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="090708109000118"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is right to say that the public do not understand why MPs should be solely responsible for their pay and conditions. That is why the Bill is so important. He was right to mention the excellent paper written by the Clerk of the Parliaments, to whom I pay tribute. I will come back to the noble Lord in writing on many points. Is there a difference between dishonesty and knowledge? There is a great difference between the elements of dishonesty and knowledge of an offence. Dishonesty requires a higher threshold for the prosecution to overcome and is determined by a two-stage test.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="090708109000119"></a>I think that I have answered many of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I love dancing and I wore the appropriate shoes today. Yes, of course it is our duty to scrutinise and improve the Bill and I am determined that that is exactly what this House should and must do. I have heard what many noble Lords have said about the arrangements that we have proposed to debate the Bill before the Recess. I have really listened and I know that the House wants more time to scrutinise the Bill. I respect those views and, while I may not go quite as far as the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, suggested, I undertake to go away and discuss the arrangements with the usual channels in the light of what has been said today to try to find more time. I have to say that we have very few days available to us and there is a great deal of business still unfinished, but I note what has been said seriously and vehemently in this House today. I assure the House that, whatever happens, the Government will bring forward their amendments for the Committee stage in very good time so that noble Lords have ample time to reflect on them.</p>

<a name="90708-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="090708109000120"></a>This is an extremely important Bill. I have listened to and noted the views of noble Lords. I believe that passing the Bill as expeditiously as possible is the right thing to do. My feelings are clear; the feelings of the

I accept that the Bill requires an awful lot more work, but I know that this House is the right place to undertake that work and that, with its assistance, the Bill will be greatly improved.

However, with the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, we are in unusual territory, and I would like to take this opportunity to make a few short points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="090708109000122"></a>As I have said several times this afternoon, I am aware of the work done and the points made about the Bill, specifically about its timing, in the Chamber this afternoon and by your Lordships&#146; Constitution Committee. I understand the concerns and the genuine desire to see legislation taken through Parliament in a measured and considered way. However, I am also aware, as anyone in this House or, especially, in the other place must be, of the strength of public feeling on these issues and the desire not just for reform and improvement but for that reform and improvement to be put in place as soon as possible. The public want action and they want it now. The Constitution Committee wants due process properly considered. However, I do not believe that the two positions are incompatible. It is not impossible to bring the two positions together, which is exactly what the Government are trying to do. We are trying to strike the right balance between the genuine public desire for urgent reform and the equally genuine constitutional call for due process. I believe that, in the arrangements that we are proposing for the Bill, we are indeed striking that balance and striking it correctly. Accordingly, I urge the House to pass the Motion that I am moving.</p>

The noble Baroness the Leader of the House said that the public want action. I am sure that that is true, but the danger is in taking action in a way that appears to be action for the sake of action.

<p><a name="09070899000003"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070899000256"></a>Lord Brett:</b> It may be helpful if I briefly set out the background to the order under consideration, which is made under Sections 12 and 113 of the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000004"></a>Last year, the then Secretary of State for Scotland announced his response to the Gould report on the 2007 Scottish elections. Following those elections, Ron Gould was invited to review what had caused the problems that occurred and make recommendations for improvements. This order, I am pleased to say, takes forward many of those improvements, including reverting to separate ballot papers for constituency and regional votes. The unacceptable number of rejected ballots in 2007 was caused in no small part by the fact that the two papers had been combined. The Government accept the rationale to revert to two papers, and this order effects that change.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000005"></a>Equally contentious was the use of what Gould called &#147;naming strategies&#148; on the regional side of the ballot paper. He recommended that, while parties should still be allowed to use registered descriptions on the regional ballot paper, this should be in a place secondary to the registered party name. We are making this change in the order, along with a change to the constituency ballot paper, where only the registered party name will appear&#151;again, in line with the Gould recommendations.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC206"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000006"></a>As a consequence of this change, we have accepted the case for allowing for the prefix &#147;Scottish&#148; to appear in front of the registered party name. We envisage this being used when the registered party is a UK-wide party. It is our view&#151;and, I understand, the view of all the other major parties&#151;that this is less confusing to voters.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000007"></a>The order also removes the option of conducting an electronic count of ballot papers. The disruption and confusion caused by e-counting machines performing poorly in 2007 was well publicised. Ron Gould quite rightly recommended that they not be used again for Scottish Parliament elections until systems had proven themselves more reliable.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000008"></a>We are also extending the timetable for elections so that there is more time between close of nominations and polling day to allow for the efficient issue and receipt of postal votes. With more than 10 per cent of votes now being cast in this way, it has become more important than ever that those votes count. There were some delays with postal votes in 2007, which meant that some voters were not able to cast their vote, never mind being certain that their vote counted. We have accepted the Gould recommendation that more time is needed to ensure better administration of postal votes. There will now be 23 days between close of nominations and the poll, an increase of one week, which will bring these elections into line with European elections.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000009"></a>These changes, along with a small number of minor amendments, have been subject to wide consultation with electoral administrators, political parties and others. In accordance with the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, we have fully consulted the Electoral Commission. Voters have also been asked for their views on matters relating to the ballot paper.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000010"></a>I am happy to report that the changes we are making are broadly welcomed, and I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000011"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09070899000257"></a>The Duke of Montrose:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining the order in his very adept way. I can only say that it is July and we are back to considering Scottish elections once again. In July 2005, we had a lunch to discuss the Arbuthnott commission. In March 2007, the order was introduced which caused so much criticism as it came too late to be fully considered and implemented before the election that took place so that in July 2007, we had the Scottish Parliament (Elections, etc) (Amendment) Order, followed by the Gould report in October 2007. Now it is July 2009, and we are considering the Scottish Parliament (Elections, etc) (Amendment) Order 2009. With all the wonders of electoral innovation that we seem to be set upon in Scotland, it is proving to be rather a rocky road.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000012"></a>The measure before us seems to be a bit of a pick and mix from the Gould report. I am very glad to see the measures that have been adopted, such as the amendment allowing more time after the closure of nominations, the amendment for separate ballot papers and even the amendment laying down rather more exactly the names of the parties which will appear on the ballot paper and perhaps limiting the more creative efforts which emanated at one point. I think that one of the nomination papers had a candidate called &#147;Alex Salmond for First Minister&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC207"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000013"></a>Perhaps I have missed some of the procedures that have gone on in the mean time, but will the Minister tell the Committee the Government&#146;s view about some of the early conclusions in the Gould report, one of which was the need to rationalise and consolidate existing legislation? There was also the recommendation that there should be a requirement that any change in the legislation should be in place at least six months before the elections in which they are to be implemented. Does the measure do anything, as requested by Gould, to clarify and define responsibilities that the principal players have in arranging elections; that is, Ministers and civil servants, returning officers and the Electoral Commission? It seems to me that the Gould committee was looking for a chief returning officer to be appointed with properly trained returning officers in each constituency. Have the Government considered this and what is their view? We must all applaud any measures that can be seen to tidy up the unholy mess that ensued from the May 2007 elections. To that extent, we welcome these measures.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000014"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070899000258"></a>Lord Steel of Aikwood:</b> I, too, give a general welcome to this order. I regularly used to tease the Minister&#146;s predecessors whenever there was a Scottish order before us, and say, &#147;Well, where is the Advocate-General?&#148; We have a Scottish Minister of the House but some unfortunate Minister is always left to introduce Scottish orders. I repeat my query as to why the Advocate-General does not present these orders himself. However, relief is at hand because the Calman commission has recommended that administration of Scottish elections should be transferred to the Scottish Parliament, which is a long overdue reform. Therefore, I hope that this might be one of the last of these orders that we see in this House.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000015"></a>I entirely go along with three of the four purposes of this order; that is, increasing the time between the close of nominations and the date of poll from 16 days to 23 days, removing the option of having one ballot paper for both the constituency and regional polls, and removing the option of electronic counting. These all came out of the Gould report. I agree with the noble Duke that that is right and I look forward to hearing the answer to his queries about other aspects of the Gould report that do not yet appear in this order.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000016"></a>The one part of the order about which I am still slightly unhappy is the use of the registered party name on nominating papers. I do not think that the order goes far enough. It makes a modest improvement to remove what I thought was an abuse at the last Scottish elections. We had a discussion on this on an amendment that my noble friend Lord Tyler and I tabled to the Political Parties and Elections Bill on the Floor of the House on 17 June. What was interesting about that debate was that there was total unanimity on the Labour Benches, the Conservative Benches and the Lib Dem Benches that something more had to be done to stop what I call sloganising on the ballot paper.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000017"></a>The word used in the order is the same as that used in that Bill. It talks about a party description, but I do not believe that the Electoral Commission has properly interpreted what is a description as distinct from a  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC208"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>slogan. The noble Duke gave us the example of &#147;Alex Salmond for First Minister&#148;. Unless we tidy this up, there is nothing to stop the Conservative Party, for example, at the next election running on the description &#147;David Cameron for Prime Minister&#148;. I find that objectionable on constitutional grounds. We do not have a presidential election system and I do not think that slogans of that kind should appear on the ballot paper. We have just had a European election where the BNP campaigned on the description &#147;protect British jobs&#148;, a slogan which has nothing to do with the real purposes of the British National Party. The Government and the Electoral Commission should look again at whether these slogans should be allowed on the ballot paper. It ought to be stopped.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000018"></a>The Minister who was on duty that day did not reply to the debate at all&#151;he just read out his totally inadequate brief. At the end of it, though, was crumb of comfort. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070899000220"></a>&#147;These matters are of course kept under review, and since this issue concerns the way in which those standing for election communicate with the electorate, it must be right that any change should be made in discussion with all those who have a stake in the electoral process&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/6/09; col. 1121.]</p>

<p><a name="09070899000209"></a>I do not expect the Minister to be able to deal with this issue now, but we have the Third Reading of the Political Parties and Elections Bill tomorrow on the Floor of the House. I would be grateful if the Minister would take back to his colleagues the fact that there was no satisfactory response to the debate in Committee and that I intend to raise the matter again tomorrow on the Floor of the House. However, with that one caveat, I accept that we should agree to the consideration of the order.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000019"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070899000259"></a>Lord Jones:</b> Surely the order is to be welcomed. How are the Scottish ballot papers devised? How are they made up? How are they formulated? Can my noble friend offer any details of the process, because it is clear that that process was greatly deficient ahead of one particular national ballot? I do not think that such a ballot paper would have got by in Wales, but that is neither here nor there in this debate.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000020"></a>The helpful Explanatory Memorandum refers to erroneous references and superfluous references. In his capacity of representing the Scottish Office, can the Minister say whether the officials who devised the most bewildering of ballot papers have in any way been called to account? In the history of elections, constituency and regional, those who devised such ballot papers were surely the subject of some censure. How did chaotic papers such as these get past scrutiny? Were the returning officers involved? Did the Minister of the day see the ballot papers in their draft? I hope that these questions may lead to further information.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000021"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070899000260"></a>Lord Foulkes of Cumnock:</b> I should first declare an interest as a Member of the Scottish Parliament. Currently, I am the only Member of the Scottish Parliament in the House of Lords, although we have some distinguished former MSPs, including the former Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, the noble Lord, Lord Steel, who carried out that job with great distinction. I shall pursue the line of argument that he pursued earlier, so we have today not only our service in the Scottish Parliament in common but our arguments.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC209"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000022"></a>The Scottish Parliament, conveniently for me if not for our Whip and our Minister, is currently in recess, so I am able to be here on a Wednesday afternoon, when the Scottish Parliament normally meets. I am afraid that during the time that it does meet, I go up to Edinburgh for the plenary sessions and the committee on which I serve. I am therefore pleased to be able to participate in this debate.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000023"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Steel, on two points. The separate ballot paper created tremendous problems. I know from participating and from the count the problems that it created. There was huge confusion when people got the two papers mixed up and it was not immediately clear even to seasoned campaigners and politicians what to do. I also agree about the timetable for postal votes. Again I declare an interest, having registered for a postal vote which I hope I will receive for the next election. The tight timetable created problems for returning officers, so that will be an improvement as well.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000024"></a>My only point of disagreement with the noble Lord, Lord Steel, is that I still have some doubts about transferring to the Scottish Parliament all responsibilities for elections to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
<h5><a name="09070899000231"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09070899000025"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070899000261"></a>Lord Steel of Aikwood:</b> The Calman commission does not in fact recommend that. It leaves the election process itself in the hands of Westminster, as provided for in the Scotland Act 1998. It talks about administration, and this is a purely administrative measure.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000026"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09070899000262"></a>Lord Foulkes of Cumnock:</b> I accept that and we are in agreement. I am grateful for the correction. The one thing I am deeply disturbed about, and on which I am going to seek in even stronger terms than the noble Lord, Lord Steel, an assurance from the Minister relates to the terms of this order. What happened was a despicable and deliberate piece of deception by the SNP. It was disgraceful and I have not seen the like of it from any political party. The Liberal Democrats get up to one or two little tricks from time to time, the Tories have been known to do it and even the Labour Party has tried it in certain parts of the country, but I have never seen the like of this before.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000027"></a>I shall slightly correct the noble Duke by saying that it was not the one candidate, but all the candidates for the regional list in every region of Scotland who had as their party description, &#147;Alex Salmond for First Minister&#148;. Not only is that a manifest nonsense as a description of a party and not only was it sloganising and propagandising, but it was chosen so that the SNP would be the first party in the list because the name &#147;Alex Salmond&#148; begins with an &#147;A&#148;. Alex Salmond said that the SNP could not be doing it for that purpose, &#147;because my mother would not have realised that we were going to be standing in these elections when I was born 58 years ago&#148;. But that was not the point. The fact is that Alex Salmond saw the opportunity to use his name as a description and took it, and the SNP would do it again if it had the chance. That is why I have reservations about any suggestion that total responsibility should be passed to a Parliament where he is still the First Minister.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000028"></a>I seek a clear assurance from my noble friend, and if he cannot give one to me today, I concur with the noble Lord, Lord Steel, that we should get it tomorrow or some time soon from the Advocate-General. Indeed, I would like to see the Advocate-General here, since he is paid quite a lot, as I keep reminding him. However, that is in no way to say that my noble friend Lord Brett is not an entirely adequate person to deal with this. However, it would be useful if the Advocate-General or indeed the Secretary of State himself in another place could give a clear, written guarantee that the provisions of this order will stop the abuse that the SNP carried out last time. I am not absolutely sure that it will because I think that ways around it can be found and that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, is correct in his suspicions.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000029"></a>I am sure that the Minister understands our concerns. If he is not able to give us an absolute assurance today that this practice will be eliminated, I hope that he will find an opportunity to do so through one of the other Ministers on another occasion.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000030"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09070899000263"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to what has been a fascinating debate. We all start from the premise that everyone sees the Scottish elections in 2007 as being less than perfect in a number of ways. That is what the Gould report was commissioned to look into and what the Government recommendation, through this order, seeks to put right.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000031"></a>I shall deal first, because it is a procedural matter, with the question of the Advocate-General. I am sure that he would have shown even more enthusiasm than I have, had he been able to, but he is representing Her Majesty&#146;s Government at an important court case in the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh, which is why your Lordships have a poor substitute in myself.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000032"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, made a good point when he asked when we are going to have some rationalisation and consolidation of this. A full consolidated version of the elections order is being put together and is in an advanced form. We hope to put it in place six months before the 2011 elections. I hope that that will meet some of those concerns.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000033"></a>A number of questions were asked about the Gould report and the aspects that were not accepted, including the question of adopting a returning officer. We can go through them as they are quite easy to deal with. Gould recommended moving to a daytime count. We have heard many complaints about the 2007 elections, but I do not think anyone has made the argument that the overnight counting was responsible for any of the confusion.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000034"></a>We believe that a randomised order on the ballot paper would be confusing to voters. We consulted widely&#151;we even used the dreaded focus groups to find out what people thought about it&#151;and there was a confirmed preference for keeping the alphabetical list and trusting politicians&#146; mothers when it comes to giving their children names that begin with an early letter in the alphabet. No, that last part is not a serious point. The main recommendations have been confirmed in this order and, I hope, subject to the questions that I am now seeking to answer, command your Lordships&#146; support.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC211"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="09070899000035"></a>A number of questions were asked by my noble friends and the noble Lord, Lord Steel, about devolving powers for Administrations. The Government have established a steering group that will look at the recommendations made by the Calman report, and we will consider this recommendation as part of that process.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000036"></a>One learns very quickly, in what in my case will probably be a short political career, that giving assurances is easy to do but difficult to recant. I will therefore resist the temptation to give any assurances, other than that I will ensure that this debate will be made known to my colleagues so that, in any discussions that take place tomorrow on another Bill, they will be well aware of the points that are being made.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000037"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones asked whether Ministers saw the ballot paper in draft. They saw early samples but not the final versions, which were prepared under the auspices of the Electoral Act 2007 steering group and the e-counting project board.</p>

One had so little knowledge about how to organise a ballot paper that one was not able to exercise any judgment on them. As has been said, one would like to know the people who designed these ballot papers.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000039"></a>The Minister talked about a consolidated order being brought forward before the next election. It would be interesting to know, in answer to another of my questions, whether there would be more definition of who has responsibility in drawing up these ballot papers and orders.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000040"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09070899000265"></a>Lord Brett:</b> That is a question to take on board, and we must ensure that when we produce those orders they seek to answer it. No doubt that question will be posed again if the upcoming proposals do not clarify that to a greater degree.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000041"></a>On the question that my noble friend Lord Foulkes asked about deception on ballot papers, I make the point that in responding to the consultation on this order, all the political parties have essentially put their name to it&#151;I say that; actually, I do not think that the Liberal Democrats have responded, but all other parties did&#151;so they are signing up, as I see it, to what we are seeking to do. One can but trust in the veracity and honesty of political parties. I have noticed, both in the noble Duke&#146;s contribution and in the earlier contribution from my noble friend, that sometimes confession is good for the soul. After confessing that we did not get it right in 2007, we hope to be in a position to get it much closer to being right&#151;or 100 per cent right if we can&#151;in 2011.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000042"></a>Sloganising was also mentioned. In fact, under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act 2000, which sets out how the Electoral Commission should determine what descriptions can be registered, the commission will receive ballot papers and designs before any future election. We hope that those proposals will be provided in the near future.</p>

I have been in touch with the Electoral Commission about the descriptions on the ballot paper. The commission answered that it could not do anything about that because it is in statute, but the Minister has just quoted the statute. The Government, on the other hand, say that trying to tighten the role would create difficulties for the Electoral Commission. All I repeat to the Minister is that I was pleasantly surprised in our debate last month on the Floor of the House to find that there was universal concern about this matter. The Electoral Commission and the Government have not yet got it right, and I hope that they will have the chance to get it right in future.</p>

These, and previous regulations that permitted the sharing of data from the school census, are part of a wider programme of work&#151;the Migration Statistics Improvement Programme&#151;which is being conducted by the National Statistician. The programme seeks to address the problems faced in estimating highly mobile populations and takes into account short-term migration.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC213"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000049"></a>Access to administrative data that are collected and held by government departments and their agencies is essential if the Office for National Statistics is to meet increasing demands for new and improved population and migration statistics. The Government are committed to doing all they can to help to improve the accuracy of the population estimates, particularly at the local level. Both central and local government need accurate information on migrant numbers and the overall changes to the size and structure of the population at the local level. This is required for resource allocation and for the planning and delivery of local services.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000050"></a>Long-term public expenditure planning, including the calculation and distribution of the formula grant to local authorities, and resource allocation to the Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families, depend on population statistics. The ONS has evaluated the content of the student record and has identified the information which it needs for its improvement work on population and migration statistics. The regulations will allow the Higher Education Statistics Agency, which collates the information on behalf of the higher education funding councils in England and Wales, to share this information with the ONS. This includes the name, date of birth, gender and ethnicity of the student, and details of their home and term-time postcodes as well as the information to facilitate an understanding of when moves take place. Access to these data will enable the ONS to refine and develop new approaches for the derivation of population estimates and projections.</p>
<h5><a name="09070899000233"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000051"></a>The benefits of sharing this information include better information on estimates of the number of migrants, improved accuracy of mid-year estimates and projections of population for local areas. These will include areas with high rates of population turnover, improved resource allocation, improved policy formulation and improved planning and delivery of service, as well as the development of ongoing research into the use of administrative data in updating population statistics without a traditional census. In addition, access to those data will help the ONS to improve the enumeration of students in the 2011 census and improve assessment of the quality of the statistics on students taken from that 2011 census.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000052"></a>The regulations also make provision for the ONS to disclose records of students living in Scotland and attending higher education institutes in England and Wales to the General Register Office for Scotland, and the records of students living in Northern Ireland and attending higher education institutes in England and Wales to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. This information will be used by these organisations to improve population and migration statistics in Scotland and Northern Ireland which will then be provided to the ONS so that it can produce UK-level migration and population statistics.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000053"></a>Data confidentiality and security arrangements are being assessed as a fundamental part of the preparation for the data sharing agreement between the organisations concerned. The ONS and the Higher Education Statistics Agency already work to tight confidentiality guidelines and have excellent data security records. They will put  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the necessary measures in place to protect data and avoid the disclosure of any private information about individual students. Information will be available from the ONS to Scotland and Northern Ireland via the secure Virtual Microdata Laboratory. During the debate held in January on schools census regulations, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, raised concerns about the large number of students resident in many cities who are not reflected in the numbers used for resource allocation. In supporting these regulations today, the Committee will help the ONS ensure that students are better represented in the statistics, leading to an improvement in the accuracy of those statistics. I therefore commend the draft regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000054"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070899000271"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations, and perhaps I may add to the welcome given to the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, earlier. When a similar order was debated last January, my noble friend Lord Bates asked the Minister to say a little more about why it is necessary to introduce children&#146;s names. In making this rather modest request, my noble friend mentioned the Children Act 2004 which refers to the confidentiality of data relating to young people. The Minister replied by saying that only 20 statisticians will have that information. Lacking the charm and tact of my noble friend Lord Bates, I should like to ask the Minister that question a little more bluntly. Why is it necessary for children&#146;s names to be disclosed? The student number is included in the information being requested, so what is the necessity for further information that would enable individuals to be identified?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000055"></a>I would also comment that only one person is needed to leak information, so while restricting the names of students to 20 statisticians reduces the chances of abuse, it does not necessarily prevent it. Statistics are about preparing numbers and percentages, so it is difficult to see why names need to be included for the purpose of producing a series of statistics. The long list of information that can be requested under this order makes me wonder whether information is being collected simply for the sake of it. Does such a mass of information end up being a help or does it become a hindrance, causing the end user to get swamped by unnecessary details?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000056"></a>Who is going to pay for producing all the information that educational establishments are being asked to provide? It will be a long, arduous task to retrieve and collate everything, and it will be a burden on the relevant establishments. They are not so overburdened with funds and personnel that they will find it easy.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000057"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070899000272"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing these regulations. We live in an age when data can be collected and stored very easily. This has enormous benefits, administratively and functionally, for recording and planning, but there are also concerns and cautions, as the Minister has laid out. We read too often of personal or sensitive information going astray, with all the dangers of infringement of civil liberties and possible misuse or abuse of information. There is a further concern that data may be inaccurately represented or analysed, with consequent damage to individuals or institutions. I note with interest the noble Lord&#146;s comments on security.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000058"></a>The Minister set out clearly that the regulations are designed to help in measuring, monitoring and understanding populations of students, with particular reference to migrant students. The funding councils collect information from the student record of each higher education institution, amounting to some 2.5 million students, a massive amount of data. With these regulations, the Statistics Board would be enabled to share information with counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, purely for statistical purposes. However, we on these Benches endorse the comments that have just been made. Why is all the personal information disclosable if the data are solely for statistics? What assurances can the Minister give that personal information, as listed in Article 4(i)(a), will not be shared so widely as to infringe privacy and personal liberty?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000059"></a>We recognise that it may be useful and productive to track the movement of students for demographic or employment or other purposes, but does the Minister agree that safeguards are necessary if we are not to move towards a society where freedom of movement is tracked and, as a result, restricted? Why is disclosure of information required to be backdated to 1 August 2000?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000060"></a>We welcome the internal review after 12 months. Will the Minister give assurances that the results of this review will be brought back to your Lordships&#146; House for consideration?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000061"></a>We support the regulations, and with those comments and questions I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000062"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070899000273"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend for his patient exposition. Is each student informed of these regulations, which permit the disclosure of information about that given student? If so, in what way are they informed? Where does it say that students will be informed that these details are likely to be made available? How can we be assured that these details are safe? What process will ensure that only a given office has these details? They seem to be priceless in some respects, when one considers the great detail that is listed. It would be helpful if we could have assurances on these matters.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000063"></a>Are the details of the student ever likely to be made available to other interested bodies? Other noble Lords have mentioned the bodies whose responsibility is to the security of the state. There is not a great deal of information in the order to answer questions such as these. I declare an interest as a university chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000064"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070899000274"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to this debate for the interweaving of questions around two areas of concern which are well understood. The questions are: why is a lot of personal information required; what is the risk; and what are we doing to ensure that it is secure? One of the problems that the Government have taken on themselves is to make all leakages of data immediately known to the public, which gives the impression sometimes that there are lots of leaks in government circles and no leaks anywhere else. Most of us know that in the commercial world there are many leakages, but they are not publicised for the very good reason that they would either damage customer confidence or provide  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC216"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information which would be of value to commercial competitors. But they are the genuine concerns that a lot of people have.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000065"></a>On identifiable information&#151;names and so on&#151;we believe that access to recording and identifying information will be essential for data-linking and matching. That will allow the ONS to cross-check the plausibility of information from different sources in order to refine and improve existing methods of estimation. Ensuring that students are counted only once and recorded in the appropriate place&#151;that is, at their term-time address&#151;is again a part of making the information that we have as accurate as possible.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000066"></a>I was asked what the information will be used for. As I have said, it will provide information to the ONS to improve population migration statistics, including small area population estimates, some national population projections, internal migration estimates, international migration estimates, and assessment and adjustment for the 2011 census. This could include leaking of the data to other survey and administrative data; for example, the 2011 census of GP registers and school centres. My noble friend fears that this information could be used for other purposes. The order is specific and we have been specific in saying what the information will be used for. Therefore, it would not be possible for it to be used in any legal form for any other purpose.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000067"></a>As to what will be disclosed to other parties, the regulations would enable onward disclosure, but that is limited to the disclosure of information from the student record in the way that I have mentioned to Northern Ireland and to Scotland through secure systems. My noble friend Lord Jones asked about the review in 12 months&#146; time and whether it would be brought back to your Lordships' House. The ONS will be responsible for reporting the benefits of this to the Migration Statistics Improvement Programme Board and the Minister overseeing it. It would not, as part of this order, be referred back here because no further legislative proposals would be required. But I am sure that the point about people wanting to be reassured would be sufficient to provide an impetus for us to put information in the public domain.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000068"></a>On how the students are informed about the regulations, the first principle of the Data Protection Act 1998 requires fair processing of the information collected about students via higher education institutes. These institutes provide information to students about the use that is made of these data, which confirms that students will be informed that this information is being collected and, more importantly, in order to reassure students, why it is being used.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000069"></a>I was also asked why data are being collected back to 2000 and who is paying for this. The data are already collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency from higher education institutes to assist the funding council and the Secretary of State in the allocation of funds. The ONS will pay for anything additional from the HESA. It comes down to the fact that the work is already being collected and the ONS will be responsible for additional finances.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000070"></a>It is worth repeating that the ONS has asked only for information that it believes will be essential to support its work in improving migration and population  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC217"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statistics. Twenty-six student-level data items have been requested, which provide basic information. A full higher education institution record has something like 150 items of information, so in that sense the ONS is seeking not to burden itself with data that it does not need and does not share.</p>
<h5><a name="09070899000234"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000071"></a>On security issues, people well understand the nervousness about private information being held, whether by banks, by the Government, by the local authority or by anyone else. I can offer only the assurance that security is now recognised as of paramount importance in this. All those involved in this work are committed to meeting the data transfer, storage and handling standards specified by the information assurance arm of the Government Communication Headquarters as the UK&#146;s national technical authority for information. I give the assurance that the Higher Education Funding Council for England and Wales will not share any identifiable information to the UK Statistics Authority until it is satisfied that these standards, and any other specific requirements, have been met.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000072"></a>The other safeguard that we have is that any people who are found to have breached confidentiality will be liable to prosecution. The Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 contains a confidential obligation with a potential criminal sanction for revealing or sharing any information unlawfully. I hope that those safeguards show the Government&#146;s determination to protect this information.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000073"></a>On the question of why records are being backdated to 2001, the answer is to provide comparison with data from the 2001 census and to provide a sound and reliable base for assessing change over time and, where appropriate, revising estimates.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000074"></a>I hope that I have satisfied noble Lords on the questions that they have asked. I will review <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow and, if I have missed any, I will write to the noble Lords concerned.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000077"></a>A small minority of those in Northern Ireland remain wedded to the ways of the past and continue to find terrorism and sectarianism acceptable. We must ensure that the criminal justice system is equipped to deal with these people.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000078"></a>As the issue of non-jury trial was debated in detail in 2007, a light-touch review was undertaken in January this year to inform the decision to extend. Next time, a more substantial review will be undertaken. During this year&#146;s review, a wide range of stakeholders was consulted on potential renewal of the provisions, including the political parties, NGOs and practitioners.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000079"></a>During the development of the current non-jury trial system, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, provided particularly invaluable assistance. As part of the recent consultation he was again consulted. He concluded, based on the discussions that he has had throughout Northern Ireland, that extension was a justified step. The chief constable and Ministers also agreed that extension was necessary.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000080"></a>Although it is difficult to compare the old Diplock system and the new system, there does appear to be a continuing reduction in the number of non-jury trials. During the last two years of the Diplock system, 125 non-jury trial cases were dealt with. As reported to Parliament last year, the DPP issued 29 certificates for non-jury trials during the first year of the operation of the system, relating to 28 cases. Since then, he has issued a further 12 certificates. That means that, in almost two years, there have been only 41 occasions on which the DPP felt that a non-jury trial was necessary because any measures to protect the jury would not suffice.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000081"></a>Our criminal justice system relies on members of the public to act as jurors. The Government must therefore do everything possible to protect them from intimidation and the fear of intimidation. Sadly, even with non-jury trials being available in Northern Ireland, juror intimidation continues. Four cases in particular have been brought to the Government&#146;s attention. In one of them, the judge considered the intimidation to be serious enough to discharge a juror, and in another the entire panel was dismissed. Witness intimidation also continues: 159 offences were reported to the PSNI last year.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000082"></a>There is a fear that the same intimidating tactics would be used against jurors if the option of a non-jury trial for the most serious cases was removed. Cases connected with paramilitaries or serious sectarianism are the most likely to pose these risks to jurors. This was key to including the provisions in the 2007 Act. Since then, we have unfortunately seen an upsurge in activity from dissident republicans. The threat from them is now higher than it was two years ago. This was brutally illustrated recently by the murders of Sappers Quinsey and Azimkar and Constable Carroll at the beginning of March this year. Furthermore, the horrific murder of father of four Kevin McDaid highlights that, while small in number, there are still those who feel that sectarianism and hatred have a place in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000083"></a>The order extends the effective period during which persons charged with indictable offences can be tried without a jury in certain circumstances, as set out in the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. Without this order, the non-jury trial system in that Act will expire on 31 July 2009. Trial without a jury under the Act is possible only where the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland has issued a certificate under Section 1 of the Act. The DPP may issue a certificate where he suspects that one or more of four conditions in the legislation are met and is satisfied that there is a risk that the administration of justice might be impaired if the trial were to be conducted with a jury.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000084"></a>The four conditions are: that the defendant is, or is an associate of, a current or former member of a currently or formerly proscribed organisation; that the offence was committed on behalf of a proscribed organisation, or that a proscribed organisation was involved with the carrying out of the offence; that an attempt, by or on behalf of a proscribed organisation, was made to prejudice the investigation or prosecution; and that the offence was committed as a result of, in connection with or in response to religious or political hostility. This approach is risk-based and ensures that there is a non-jury trial only where it is absolutely necessary. There is the presumption of a jury trial unless one or more of the conditions applies.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000085"></a>Before issuing a certificate for a non-jury trial, the DPP considers whether other measures, such as making an application to the court for screening off the jury from the public, would allow him to be satisfied that there was no risk that the administration of justice might be impaired if the trial were to be conducted with a jury.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000086"></a>Non-jury trial remains an exceptional measure that is used only where there is no alternative. I am satisfied that extension of the non-jury trial arrangements for a further period is a necessary and proportionate step. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000087"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09070899000277"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the Minister for so clearly laying out the details of this statutory instrument and in particular for clarifying the conditions under which the DPP can reasonably expect to license a non-jury trial.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000088"></a>My party and I support the order&#151;although, not surprisingly, it is with great regret. I asked the Minister&#146;s officials during the previous debate how many times Diplock courts had been used in recent years, and I should clarify that she gave me the answer just now. The number was higher than I thought. However, it demonstrates to all the truth of what is going on in my home Province.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000089"></a>There is still far too much organised crime; there is, as the Minister pointed out, a significant amount of terrorism from dissidents and&#151;to correct her a little&#151;a certain amount still from loyalists in the line of sectarianism and hatred. Unfortunately, it is now directed against immigrants such as Poles, Chinese and Romanians. It takes the form of gangs and organised crime. We saw the same sort of thing conducted on a smaller scale by a bunch of football thugs in Coleraine after the Rangers-Celtic match, when a father of a family&#151;a very good man, a community worker&#151;was murdered quite unnecessarily.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000090"></a>I have pressed for some time my colleague in another place, Owen Patterson, to be more critical of the way in which the Province is being led, both by its Secretary of State and the PSNI leadership. The chief constable is leaving; he has been known to be leaving for some considerable time; a replacement has not yet been found. The PSNI replaced its deputy, who left some time ago, before replacing the chief, knowing that the two were going to go together, which was ridiculous. It had a wonderful opportunity to pick the No. 1 and let the No. 1 have influence in who his No. 2 was going to be&#151;but, no, they did not do that, because they knew better, didn&#146;t they? That sort of thing is going in Northern Ireland. It intimidates people and prevents their devolving justice and policing. I would find it very difficult today to vote for devolution of policing and justice&#151;that is a personal issue; where my party stands on it is probably slightly different.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000091"></a>As the Minister said, there is also a serious risk of juries being intimidated&#151;in fact, they are being intimidated from time to time&#151;and it is even more difficult to bring witnesses to court, because they, too, are at serious risk of intimidation due to the family structure of the little Province, where everybody knows everybody, criminal gangs operate in particular communities and it is extremely hard to find witnesses to come forward. I met some potential witnesses after the young police constable was killed in Craigavon. I was there the morning after. It is easy to understand that attitude when you stand on the ground, see the sight-lines and know who lives there. If I was in one of those houses near to where that poor young man was killed, I would not be too keen to go into court as a witness and say, &#147;I saw Bloggs; that was him&#148;. I am making the Government&#146;s case here, in outlining where I believe there is a need to continue, sad as it is, with what I call the Diplock, or non-jury, courts.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000092"></a>What is perhaps more worrying and more interesting is something that I have not actually read, but my noble friend Lord Trimble told me about it. In today&#146;s <I>Irish Times</I> it is reported that the Republic of Ireland, or Ireland as it is now correctly known, is also debating in both Houses of the Dail a proposal to bring in non-jury trials. That is for similar problems to those we have in the north. Much as I would love to see non-jury trials come back to my Province in the next year or two, by the time this order runs out, it depresses me to think that it will not happen. Therefore, I must support the Government&#146;s action in extending the Act.</p>
<h5><a name="09070899000236"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09070899000093"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070899000278"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> I, too, thank the noble Baroness for introducing this order in her usual clear and precise way. I want also to place on the record my thanks for the meeting yesterday with the Northern Ireland Office. The officials were extremely helpful and we had a useful exchange of views and ideas. However, it is frustrating and disappointing that the Government did not hold a full public consultation on the immensely important extension of this order.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000094"></a>The noble Baroness referred to a light-touch review being undertaken. It means that neither this Committee nor anyone else in Parliament can scrutinise the basis on which the Secretary of State has taken the decision to extend these provisions.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC221"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000095"></a>As we have heard, the primary justification by the UK Government for non-jury trials in Northern Ireland is to avoid paramilitary and community-based pressures on jurors. The Government say that it is difficult to judge the level of juror intimidation in Northern Ireland yet conclude that it remains prevalent, and indeed we have heard the noble Lord explain that. What is happening in Northern Ireland is extremely difficult, but should not be used as an excuse for the police not to look after jurors, although intimidation appears to be a growing problem. However, the Government have failed to provide any substantial evidence to this end. Can the Minister give examples or cite evidence that she may have as opposed to that of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000096"></a>We also cannot tell whether the Secretary of State considered any revisions to the scheme. For example, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, recently raised concerns regarding the use of non-jury trials and the lack of a sufficient appeal mechanism for challenging a decision by the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland to hold a trial in the absence of a jury. The HRC has noted the lack of obligation on the director to provide &#147;objective and reasonable grounds&#148; when applying different rules of criminal procedure, which is contrary to Article 14 of the ICCPR. The right to legal challenge, particularly judicial review, is a basic right that was acknowledged by the Northern Ireland Office in its 2006 consultation paper regarding the replacement of the Diplock courts. It stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="09070899000225"></a>&#147;the DPP&#146;s decision will be challengeable by means of judicial review. This will enable defendants to be sure that the decision has been taken properly&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070899000212"></a>However, the actual legislation permits judicial review only in exceptional circumstances. Was this something the Government considered amending when reviewing the legislation?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000097"></a>We are further concerned that by continuing with provisions for non-jury trials in Northern Ireland, the Government are sending the wrong signals to the public. Mr Eddie McGrady, the SDLP MLA for South Down, told the House of Commons General Committee on Delegated Legislation:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070899000221"></a>&#147;If we want to send the message of the return to normality, this is not the message to send. However the proposal is refined by using the phrase &#145;non-jury trials&#146; ... in Northern Ireland, they are seen as the continuation of the Diplock courts and the continuation of the oppressive system of justice&#148;.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000098"></a>Northern Ireland is not experiencing an emergency as defined by Article 15 of the ECHR, and to continue to trial provisions in Northern Ireland as if there were an emergency perpetuates a lack of confidence in the rule of law. It may be argued that judges sitting alone can impartially and independently hold trial and therefore non-jury trials are not a breach of the right to a fair trial, but jury trials are inexorably linked to the common law system in legislation, so non-jury trials undermine this principle and weaken public confidence in the justice system and the overall peace process in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000099"></a>According to the criminal justice review, more than three-quarters of the population of Northern Ireland believes that juries are better at deciding cases in the  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC222"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Crown Court than are judges sitting alone. In the words of the review, jury trials reflect,</p>
<ul><a name="09070899000226"></a>&#147;a symbol of normality with all that means for public confidence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09070899000213"></a>The HRC stated that the Government should carefully consider whether the situation in Northern Ireland warrants judicial procedures that are intrinsically different from the rest of the UK, with a view to abolishing such distinctions. The introduction of jury trials for all cases would be a way to acknowledge and commend the enormous political and social strides that have been made in the past decade, furthering reciprocal confidence between the people and the state. The original legislation provided for special measures to protect jurors. Will the Minister tell us how these are working?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000100"></a>Finally, although the Government will have decided to renew the non-jury trial provisions before the acts of decommissioning by loyalist paramilitaries last weekend, which are very welcome, do they not agree that non-jury trials must be looked at in a different context? Will the Minister consider withdrawing the order and replacing it with a provision to extend the provisions for just one year, as proposed by my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000101"></a>The Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, in considering the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 (Extension of duration of non-jury trial provisions) Order 2009, said under the heading &#147;Who supported the extension, and why?&#148;:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070899000222"></a>&#147;Lord Carlile met and discussed the issues with a wide range of practitioners and stakeholders, including political parties and interested NGOs throughout Northern Ireland. His conclusion, on the basis of the discussions he had, was that the case was made out to extend the provisions for a further year&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000214"></a>That is not quite what the Minister said, although we know that the provisions in the order are for two years. Perhaps she would consider an extension for one year rather than two years, so that both she and the Committee can reflect on the changed circumstances more promptly. The extension under this order is profoundly regrettable.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000102"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070899000279"></a>Lord Bew:</b> I thank the Minister for the exposition that she has given of the case for this instrument. Like other noble Lords today, I am delighted to see her back at the Dispatch Box.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000103"></a>I strongly support the instrument in the terms in which it has been laid out. I wanted to pose a question but, having listened to the Minister, I have changed my mind about what the most burning question is. I had wanted to ask why the Government reasonably believed two years ago that it might be possible at this stage to dispense with non-jury trials as an element in the justice system in Northern Ireland. Listening to her, I accept that the reasons she has given provide an answer, in a way&#151;we are dealing with unprecedented and unpredictable circumstances in the recent revival of republican violence.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000104"></a>I find myself with another question, though: why do the Government believe that two years from now they will not be coming back to this House and asking for a further extension? I want to develop a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, when he referred to what is happening in the Irish Republic. In fact, the Dáil has moved beyond the point of discussion of this idea; last night the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill in Dublin passed its committee stage and it is  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC223"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expected to become law this week. It will mean, bluntly, that it will abolish the use of jury trial for a range of new offences, especially those concerned with organised criminality of the sort that we are dealing with.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000105"></a>We accept that much of this crime in Ireland has a cross-border basis. Is it realistic to suggest that the Irish Republic is moving towards a system where it accepts that it is not going to be using jurors because of the prevalence of intimidation in many of these cases while a few miles away in Northern Ireland, which is an equally fraught terrain, two years from now we will move completely back to jury trials? My suspicion and my fear&#151;I regret this, because I understand exactly the underlying philosophy motivating what the Minister has said, and I accept the desirability of jury trials&#151;is that, in such circumstances, it will not be possible two years from now unless things develop in Irish society in a way that is more benign than we might believe, or than the Irish Ministry of Justice seems to believe as it lays out the rationale for this major change in Irish law.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000106"></a>I have a question about the relationship between the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Dublin. Going back to the days when Sir John Chilcot was the Permanent Under-Secretary, if not before, the relationship between those two offices has traditionally been a close and friendly one&#151;perhaps closer and more consistently friendly than that with other departments of state in Dublin. I wonder whether the Minister is in a position to say anything about whether these current proposals have been discussed with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Dublin in the light of what that department is doing with regard to the Irish Republic, where we are with that relationship and the type of discussions that go on.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000107"></a>I repeat, although with a heavy heart, that it would be irresponsible to do anything other than to accept the basis of the instrument.</p>

Although he was saying similar things to me, they are two totally independent views.</p>

I note the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, about which he has been very frank, and I will take them back. He quoted the recent dreadful attack on the Romanian people, and I agree with him that hate crimes and racism have no place in Northern Ireland; those who carried out the attack have no real place. Racist attacks are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. As the noble Lord knows, the police have arrested six people in relation to those attacks. Three have been charged, of whom two were released on court bail and a third was remanded in custody. The other three arrested have been released on police bail pending further inquiries.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>

<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC224"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Court in Dublin to deal with organised crime cases. As noble Lords will know, the situation here is that under the 2007 Act we are enabled to take such cases to be tried without a jury where they are connected to paramilitaries or sectarianism and there might be a risk to the administration of justice. It all seems to be going in the wrong direction as far as our hopes are concerned.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000111"></a>I hope that noble Lords will bear with me because I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, deserves a fairly detailed response to several of her questions. I know that she was not satisfied, and certainly her colleagues in another place were not satisfied, with the length of replies to this order. She asked about the rationale for extension. Paramilitary-based and community-based pressures on a jury mean that there is still a risk of perverse verdicts in certain cases. These arrangements are designed to ensure that a fair trial can be provided in all cases where there are ongoing risks to the administration of justice. Where there are ongoing risks, the administration of justice might be impaired, and we must act.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000112"></a>The non-jury trial system targets the particular risks posed by cases involving paramilitaries and serious sectarianism. Sadly, these types of cases continue to arise in Northern Ireland, as shown by the recent murders of Kevin McDaid, Constable Stephen Caroll and Sappers Quincy and Azimkar. We are all aware that the level of threat in Northern Ireland from dissident republicans is now higher than when the Parliament considered these arrangements in detail in 2007 and concluded that they were necessary and appropriate.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000113"></a>If we are looking at the rationale for extension, risks to jurors remain significant. Even with the changes that have been made to the jury system and the ability to hold non-jury trials in certain cases, I am aware of four reported cases of attempted jury intimidation. In one case a juror had to be discharged and in another a whole jury was discharged. Noble Lords referred to witness intimidation; 159 such cases were recorded by the PSNI in 2008. We know that intimidation is significantly underreported, so the real figure is likely to be much higher.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000114"></a>Intimidation is completely unacceptable. It remains a significant issue that the Government are concerned that removing the ability to try certain cases without a jury would expose jurors to a risk of intimidation that is completely unacceptable. If paramilitaries are prepared to use these tactics against witnesses in order to frustrate police investigations and prosecutions, it seems to me that they would be willing to intimidate jurors as well as witnesses. Sadly, Northern Ireland society remains vulnerable to intimidation. People live in small, close-knit communities, as noble Lords have said, where it is much easier to identify those on jury service.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000115"></a>The number of non-jury trials, as I have said, is diminishing. There were 125 Diplock cases in the last two years of that system, which represents 6 per cent of Crown Court cases. In the most recent two years, the DPP has issued 41 certificates for non-jury trial, and 1 per cent of Crown Court cases have been heard been heard without a jury. This is a welcome change and I hope that the numbers continue to fall, but the

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000116"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Harris, asked what right of appeal exists to the DPP&#146;s decisions. She will know that decisions are judicially reviewed where there has been bad faith, or in other exceptional circumstances. However, a defendant will suffer no detriment from being tried without a jury&#151;in some cases, it may even be fairer&#151;and we see no need for other avenues of appeal. Perhaps I could write to the noble Baroness to expand on that.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000117"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether we were considering amending the legislation. The 2007 Act does not permit amendment, only extension, but the Government have committed to examining the system in detail, with a public consultation, before the next extension in 2011. This issue can be considered then.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000118"></a>The noble Baroness asked about judicial review of juror protection measures. Juror protection measures, including juror anonymity and the abolition of peremptory challenge, were challenged in the McParland judicial review. The court rejected the challenge and ruled that the jury provisions in the 2007 Act did not violate Article 6 of the ECHR. The jury made clear in McParland that the new arrangements pursue a clear and proper public objective and represent a fair balance between the general interests of the community and the personal rights of the individual.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000119"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the measures could be extended for one year. Our response is that it is not possible under the Act. We have subsequently spoken to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, who confirmed to us that he supports the extension for two years.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000120"></a>The noble Baroness said that returning to jury trial would be a mark of a return to normality, with which we of course agree&#151;I said in my opening remarks that we would want to return to it as soon as possible. We are on a journey towards a more normal Northern Ireland, although many aspects of the past continue. We all hope that these measures can be ended as soon as circumstances allow.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000121"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, asked why we thought that circumstances would have changed in two years and whether two years would be enough. We do not know at this stage&#151;it is a question of whether the glass is half empty or half full. We hope that the situation is more optimistic in two years&#146; time. We shall need to consider the situation carefully as part of a thorough review, which will include the views of the public. By 2011 there will be a greater body of evidence on which to make the decision. We talked about the light-touch review in January or February of this year, but the thorough review, in which we consult the public and stakeholders, will give us a clearer picture of the risks and the opportunities involved.</p>

<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Children Act 1989 (Higher Education Bursary) (England) Regulations 2009.</p>

<ul><a name="09070899000251"></a>
<p><I>Relevant Document: 18th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.</I></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="09070899000122"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09070899000283"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> These draft regulations set out arrangements for payment of a bursary to care leavers who are over 18, referred to in the Children Act 1989 as &#147;former relevant children&#148;, who go on to pursue a course of higher education. Section 21 of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 requires local authorities to pay a higher education bursary to those young people, and these draft regulations deliver the commitments that we made during the passage of the Children and Young Persons Bill.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000123"></a>The draft regulations provide for four aspects of these arrangements. Actually, I am not sure whether technically they are still draft regulations when they are laid. If they are, then I shall carry on saying &#147;draft&#148;. They set the amount of the bursary at &#163;2,000 in total for each eligible young person, prescribe the meaning of &#147;higher education&#148;, specify arrangements in relation to the timing of payments of the bursary, whether it is paid as a lump sum or by instalments, and specify the circumstances in which payments can be withheld or recovered by the local authority. The bursary is a key part of the Government&#146;s strategy for improving outcomes for care leavers.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000124"></a>Currently, only 7 per cent of former relevant children aged 19 or over go on to higher education. If we want to see improvements in participation rates and in the number of these young people who go on to complete their courses, we must address the financial disadvantages that many of them face. Research suggests that students from a care background leave university with an average of &#163;2,000 more debt than their peers. The bursary will ensure that those care leavers who go on to higher education receive additional financial assistance. Many local authorities already provide such support, but not all do. By placing a duty on local authorities to pay eligible care leavers a &#163;2,000 bursary, we will remove this financial disadvantage in future. Since April 2008 we have provided local authorities with the money to do this through their area-based grant.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000125"></a>In drafting the regulations we have been at pains to ensure that the arrangements for payment of the bursary are as straightforward as possible. We have therefore aligned the meaning of &#147;higher education&#148; for the purpose of determining eligibility for the bursary with the definition in regulations made under Section 22(1) of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. Section 4(4) of the Act was amended to make it clear  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC227"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the local authority must, as far as is reasonably possible, consult the young person and give due consideration to his or her wishes before making a decision about payment of the bursary.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000126"></a>There are two limitations placed on the timing of payments. First, where the young person and local authority agree that it would be more appropriate to pay the bursary in a lump sum, it should be paid by the end of the first term. Secondly, where the bursary is to be paid in instalments, the first instalment must be paid during the first term of the course and the final instalment must be paid before the end of the course.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000127"></a>These regulations build on the existing provisions under Section 23C of the Children Act 1989. The new bursary must be paid in addition to any assistance that the young person may be entitled to under Section 23C(4) to meet his or her welfare needs. The level of support provided varies widely between local authorities. These regulations will reduce that differential by creating an additional requirement on local authorities to provide financial support. I commend them to the Committee.</p>
<h5><a name="09070899000239"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09070899000128"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070899000284"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing this order because it gives us an opportunity to speak about a group of people often left behind in society. The needs of care leavers as they progress into higher education and eventually into employment are a concern for us all. These young people are disadvantaged from the start due to a comparative inability to finance their studies. Given the high level of care leavers not in employment, education or training, this issue demands our full attention. The Government&#146;s own figures on the outcomes for looked-after children show a staggering failure to give care leavers even a fraction of the opportunities that we take for granted for our own children.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90708-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000129"></a>As the Minister acknowledges, only 7 per cent of care leavers are on a course of higher education at 19. Given the Government&#146;s blanket target of 50 per cent of young people to attend university, this is a startling figure. Equally sad is the fact that 29 per cent of former care leavers are NEET at 19, which is more than double the national figure of 13 per cent. It is encouraging that the Government have recognised the problem. The higher education bursary will give relief to many care leavers struggling under higher education debt without the financial support that their contemporaries receive from their families. However, the measure seems to be too little, too late. It is being introduced as the Government&#146;s term comes to an end, who heralded in 1997 the words, &#147;Education, education, education&#148;, but after 12 years in power have failed to address the disparity of outcomes experienced by care leavers and their contemporaries. Does the Minister agree that this has been a dereliction of governmental responsibility?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000130"></a>There are some concerns about a lack of clarity about eligibility for the bursary, and as the money is available only to those who have spent 13 weeks or more in care, could the Minister make it clear whether this must be consecutive weeks or just 13 weeks in total? If it is 13 consecutive weeks, will there not be an  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC228"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>incentive for local authorities to remove children from care prior to them hitting that threshold? Will the higher education bursary be available to young people who have had a special guardianship order placed on them? If not, why is that? Will the Minister also clarify the age limit for the bursary? As it stands, care leavers are classified as &#147;former relevant children&#148; between the ages of 18 and 21, but a young person over 21 who is still receiving support with education and training from a local authority will be a former relevant child until the end of the programme of study. Does this mean that young people who are over 21 qualify for the grant?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000131"></a>I would like some more clarity on the figures involved in these regulations. It would be interesting to know where the nicely rounded figure of &#163;1 million per annum has come from. CAFCASS&#146;s figures show that the demand for care places in March 2009 was the highest recorded in a single month, while care demand was up 3.6 per cent in 2008-09 from the year before. Does the &#163;1 million take into account fluctuating numbers of care leavers at higher education age? Where will the &#163;1 million come from? On what have the Government based the view that there will be a 10 per cent increase year-on-year of care leavers going on to higher education? The Government&#146;s own figures utterly refute this. Is it responsible of the Government to project their spending according to their own hugely optimistic projections for care leavers entering higher education?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000132"></a>Similarly, it would be helpful to know what costs may be involved in marketing the scheme and other transitional costs. How will care leavers be made aware of the higher education bursary? Will that come out of the &#163;1 million or will unexpected costs be involved? It is also of concern that the figure for the bursaries themselves, &#163;2,000, comes from research undertaken four years ago. That may have been the excess debt that care leavers were saddled with then. Can the Minister guarantee that the sum is still appropriate and that it will be regularly reviewed?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000133"></a>Under Regulation 4, the local authority has the power to decide on the method of payment of the bursary. Why is this the case? What is meant by:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070899000223"></a>&#147;Before making any decision about payment of the higher education bursary the local authority must, as far as reasonably practicable, ascertain and give due consideration to the wishes and feelings of the former relevant child&#148;?</p>

<p><a name="09070899000216"></a>Is there a case for allowing care leavers themselves to decide? We also seek guarantees that this grant will not detract from the local authority&#146;s responsibilities under Section 23. Authorities must not claim that the grant covers costs such as housing assistance that they might otherwise be obliged to provide. Will the Minister offer an assurance that this will not occur?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000134"></a>While it is important to deal with debts incurred by care leavers during their higher education, we must not forget that it is in terms not merely of a lesser ability to pay for university that care leavers are disadvantaged. My honourable friends Michael Gove and Tim Loughton have spoken recently about the disparity of attainment at GCSE level between children in care and their contemporaries. Under this Government, the gap has grown from 46.3 per cent in 2005 to 49.4 per cent in 2008. Will the Minister outline what  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC229"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Government are doing to ensure that schools give particular attention to the education of children in care, and that universities consider the potential of looked-after children whose grades may have been achieved in circumstances of extreme difficulty and may not accurately reflect their abilities?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000135"></a>While we on these Benches welcome the higher education bursary, the Minister should assure us that everything possible is being done to ensure that the attainment gap between care leavers and their contemporaries is bridged. I shall listen carefully to her response.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000136"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070899000285"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the regulations. We warmly welcome moves for children who have spent time in care to be given resources to help overcome any disadvantage in relation to their peer group. The evidence set out in the impact assessment shows clearly that looked-after children, as an identifiable cohort, have lower prospects of educational achievements.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000137"></a>Some 13 per cent of looked-after children obtain five good GCSEs compared with 62 per cent for all children, and 64 per cent obtain at least one GCSE compared with 99 per cent of all children. This is proof positive that these young people need additional help if they are to have a full chance of success in life and in the community.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000138"></a>The figure particularly relevant to this order is that 6 per cent of care leavers go on to university&#151;we have heard also 7 per cent: it is of that order of magnitude. That is dramatically below the anticipated 40 per cent to 50 per cent of young people who progress into one form or another of higher education.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000139"></a>It is estimated that around 400 young people will be eligible for this bursary, with, as we have heard, the Government making &#163;1 million available to local authorities for the purpose. The impact of this funding is likely to be modest. As the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, said, it is not just funding that deters these young people from going on in their educational life. Will the Minister reassure us that the cost of administration and bureaucracy for this bursary is proportionate? On quick calculations based on O-level maths from very many years ago, I estimate that around 20 per cent of available funding will be spent on administration, which seems high.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000140"></a>The consultation on the regulations elicited only 23 responses, which is a very small group on which to base proposed regulations. Nearly half the respondents expressed doubt in one form or another about the flexibility for local authorities to manage the payments. Will the Minister clarify what response the Government have made to the doubts that were raised?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000141"></a>We note that the benefits of this proposal will outweigh the costs if it results in five additional care leavers obtaining degrees. Is the aim primarily to reduce drop-out rates, as the target seems to suggest, or to encourage participation?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000142"></a>Might the bursary also be available to young people taking up any vocational programmes of equivalent level at further education colleges? It is mentioned in the Explanatory Note that it takes into account,</p>
<ul><a name="09070899000227"></a>&#147;full-time and part-time courses and some courses delivered by distance learning&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC230"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09070899000217"></a>However, if it does not apply to FE colleges, has any thought been given to a similar level of financial assistance for those going on into more skills-based further education? The bursary has been set at &#163;2,000. How and when will this amount be reviewed?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000143"></a>I repeat our support for any innovative measures that give every possible encouragement and opportunity to young people leaving care. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000144"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070899000286"></a>Lord Jones:</b> These are very welcome regulations. It is rather nice to think that these things are on the move. I thank my noble friend for her exemplary introduction. After looking at the Explanatory Notes and the regulations, how shall we define a pathway plan? What will be its structure? Who will be responsible? How will it be of advantage to the proposed student? Do we know what sums of money are involved for a bursary? I think I have heard that the sum will be only &#163;2,000, which will be a ceiling and will be fixed. Are there any examples of the likely and typical amounts that may be paid under the proposed ceiling? Are there any examples that can be furnished later by letter?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000145"></a>Finally, I know that my noble friend is not a Minister in this Committee for the principality and the matters of the principality, but I ask in curiosity whether there is a similar scheme for Wales. I hope that there is because it clearly will be advantageous for those young people moving into higher and further education. If there is not, why is there not and how might the Minister be influential in the principality?</p>

<p><a name="09070899000146"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070899000287"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for the enthusiasm that they have shown for this statutory instrument. I shall attempt to answer all the questions. If I fail to pick up on a point, I will be very happy to write further to noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asserted that this is too little too late and represents a staggering failure. I should like to put on the record that this represents another step in a long list of extremely significant and important commitments that this Government have made to improving outcomes for looked-after children. For me, as a bit of a techie who is sometimes interested in numbers, it is quite remarkable that when the party opposite was in government it chose not even to measure the outcomes for looked-after children. Outcomes became measured only in 2000. I fully appreciate her interest and commitment to the well-being of looked-after children, but I would not take any lessons from the party opposite on how to promote improvements in outcomes.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000147"></a>However, if we look at improving outcomes for looked-after children in comparison with the rest of the child population, I am certainly not satisfied that the outcomes are increasing quickly enough. I certainly do not want to see a situation where the number of young people going into higher education does not increase in the way that we hope to see. But I would look to the evidence so far, from which we know that in 2004 about 5 per cent of care leavers went on to higher education. Now, only a few years later, that has increased to 7 per cent, which must give us a great deal of encouragement. We will ensure that we are tireless in our work to drive up that statistic further.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000148"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, wanted to know whether the 13 weeks needed to be consecutive. We are talking about the definition of &#147;looked-after child&#148;, which is clearly set out legally; it does not require consecutive weeks. The special guardianship entitlement is based on looked-after status. Special guardianships do not represent looked-after status, so unless young people subject to special guardianship formerly had looked-after status, that would not count towards their 13 weeks.</p>
<h5><a name="09070899000240"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000149"></a>We are talking about ensuring that a course must start before the young person reaches the age of 26. Care leavers might find that they do not necessarily follow the traditional path of going to school in the normal way, doing A-levels and going on to university. Sometimes they come in and out of education, so it is important that the age limit is there.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000150"></a>A question was asked on the cost of marketing and the &#163;1 million. Marketing would not be necessary. Care leavers are entitled to intensive and important support from the local authority care-leaving service. They have personal advisers whose job it is to help them; those advisers will ensure that they are aware of the bursaries.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000151"></a>I have just been given some clarification. Sorry&#151;the course must start on or before the 25th birthday, not the 26th birthday.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000152"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Verma and Lady Garden, and my noble friend Lord Jones asked about the value of the &#163;2,000. As I said and as noble Lords picked up, it was based on the outcome of research comparing the debt of care leavers when they finish higher education courses with that of the normal population. As the Committee knows, the extremely comprehensive reform programme for looked-after children, Care Matters, has an annual stocktake that Ministers are responsible for ensuring. The first will take place in October, and annually it will look at the programme of support and the promotion of improved outcomes for looked-after children. The &#163;2,000 bursary and its effectiveness will form part of the Care Matters stocktake, so that will be an important review point.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000153"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was concerned about the local authority method of payment. As I said, we need to be clear that former looked-after children can be some of the most vulnerable young people. It is important that the methods of payment are agreed with them&#151;for example, whether it is their preference to have payment in one lump sum or spread over a period. The noble Baronesses, Lady Verma and Lady Garden, were concerned about additional support&#151;whether the additional &#163;2,000 bursary would be used in the place of other support.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000154"></a>With regard to FE, for example, there are clear instruments that local authorities use, Section 23 being one of them. We have been clear in the guidance that this is in no way intended to replace any other duties that local authorities have to support care leavers. Local authorities support care leavers in a host of different ways; they provide accommodation for holidays and support for books, computers and other ancillary items that care leavers might need when going on to  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC232"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>education. This is not meant to undermine that at all, so I can offer the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, in particular the assurance that she was asking for.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000155"></a>What are the Government doing to promote improved educational opportunity for looked-after children? Noble Lords are right&#151;it is not just about a bursary or whether or not young people consider that university is for them; it is also about whether they can achieve the academic qualifications necessary to take that step.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000156"></a>For example, we have been working hard to test out the new role of a virtual head teacher, which has been piloted. Local authorities can appoint a virtual head who takes over the role of co-ordinating the educational support and service for looked-after children in an area and manages it like a school, ensuring that those children get the one-to-one tuition that they are entitled to and that each school that they attend has an appointed special teacher who is their point of contact. The virtual head teacher makes sure that all the good elements that exist are working in one direction towards driving up achievement in the interests of looked-after children. That is making a big difference.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000157"></a>Then there are other issues such as promoting better attendance and making sure that young people who are in care have stability of placement. That is what the Care Matters programme is ultimately all about: promoting stability of placement so that young people do not move around or end up moving school just before their exams and so on. As the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and other noble Lords are well aware, these are all part of an integrated approach&#151;almost an holistic approach&#151;to ensuring that we drive up educational standards for looked-after children.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000158"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Garden, talked about the small numbers and whether the impact of the &#163;2,000 bursary was cost-effective. Any regulations that we bring forward need to be looked at in an impact assessment, and we have taken advice from our chief economist. This area is very new and it is difficult to assess the economic impact of something involving such small numbers, but we have every reason to believe that the bursary will help the small numbers involved. Because of that, we are committed to taking it forward. As I have said, in the annual stocktake we will look forensically at the impact that all these initiatives are having on the outcomes for looked-after children.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000159"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones asked about the devolved Administrations. As I understand it, there are similar support packages in place for care leavers in Wales. Wales will choose to manage the support for looked-after children and care leavers in the way that is most suitable for young people in Wales, and I know that it works hard to ensure that care leavers get the best possible opportunities.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000160"></a>There are real requirements on care-leaving services to ensure that young people have pathway plans and a personal adviser who will help them to enter education, training or work. As a corporate parent, the local authority makes a very important contribution in ensuring that the young people whom it parents have what we all want for our children&#151;a decent future, a career or a job, a home, and opportunities for the future. That is what these pathway plans are all about.</p>

</ul>

<p><a name="09070899000162"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09070899000289"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 reforms arrangements for safeguarding children and vulnerable adults from harm, or the risk of harm, by employees whose work gives them significant access to these groups. The new arrangements that it introduces replace those provided for under the Protection of Children Act 1999, the Care Standards Act 2000, the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000 and the Education Act 2002.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000163"></a>Together, the provisions in this order support the commencement of the full range of barring under the new scheme and the repeal of existing barring schemes, bringing about a further milestone in the transition  to the new scheme. The order amends some details  of the scope of regulated activity to improve the  practical working of the vetting and barring scheme. These provisions are needed so that the Independent Safeguarding Authority&#151;or the ISA, as it is often called&#151;can start the full range of barring under the new scheme on 12 October 2009.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000164"></a>The order slightly narrows the scope of the definition of &#147;relevant child care premises&#148; to make it consistent with the general intention of the Act not to impose requirements on people in their own homes. An amendment is also made to bring child-minding premises in Wales within the definition.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000165"></a>The order enables the Secretary of State to refer unfinished List 99 cases to the ISA. That will close off, in a timely fashion, part of the transitional process. Articles 25 and 26 of the order add certain named categories of people to the list of office-holders set out in Schedule 4 to the Act.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000166"></a>The order commences provisions that are inserted into the Police Act 1997 relating to the information that is to be provided to employers who check whether a person is on an ISA barred list. The order also modifies them to ensure that information about any person on the current barred lists is also provided to  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC234"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employers. This last step is an essential part of managing a safe transition from the current schemes to the new scheme. A Criminal Records Bureau disclosure must still show the barred status of any individual who is still on the current barred lists after 12 October 2009.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000167"></a>The order re-enacts some provisions from the current transitional period in order to ensure that the present safeguards remain in place for as long as necessary. Permanent replacement provisions will then come into force over the next year. These measures would enact previously agreed policy. Following consultation, we have included one additional provision on the addition of school governing body associate members and clerks, and local authority chief executives, to the scope of regulated activity. Finally, the order corrects two minor omissions in the prescribed criteria regulations which set out the auto barring offences. This order forms a key part of the transition to the new vetting and barring scheme, and I commend it to the Committee.</p>
<h5><a name="09070899000242"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09070899000168"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070899000290"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> Before I start, I should like to declare an interest as a provider in social care. The needs of vulnerable groups in the UK are certainly a huge priority for us all. Careful attention must be given to ensuring that they and their interests are protected. Developing a robust system that has the confidence of the public and all those working with children and vulnerable adults is delicate work. Provisions need to be precise and watertight to avoid the possibility of loopholes being sought. Such an instance would have disastrous effects and in many cases cause serious harm to children and vulnerable adults. This is particularly so in a scheme that operates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with parallel provisions being developed by Scottish Ministers.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000169"></a>The ISA was set up to prevent unsuitable people working with children and vulnerable adults. The ISA has the authority to make legally binding decisions on a case- by-case basis about whether a person is suitable to work with these groups. Only individuals who are judged not to pose a risk to vulnerable people can be ISA registered. Employers who work with vulnerable groups will be permitted only to recruit people who are registered. The ISA can bar undesirable individuals from accessing vulnerable children and adults and will hear representations on certain automatic barring provisions where this is facilitated by the legislation. This is both welcome and necessary. This SI builds upon the ISA&#146;s responsibilities by adding new ones and amending the definition of &#147;activity&#148;, as well as making transitional arrangements from the current system of barring and vetting. While we support the overall spirit of what this SI aims to achieve, I have concerns and there are areas in which I would like to seek greater clarity.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000170"></a>The new system is complex and relies on the accurate and speedy work of a number of different organisations that will require extensive auditing, and, despite continued pressure from our Benches, it still contains considerable flaws. Although the SI proposes some changes to the responsibilities of the ISA, it does not address any of the underlying weaknesses of the ISA itself or some of the inconsistencies in the provisions of the Safeguarding

The Act states that any &#147;frequent&#148; contact with children and vulnerable adults requires registration with the ISA. The then Minister qualified &#147;frequent&#148; as:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09070899000224"></a>&#147;Typically, more than one day a month and a contract of more than a week defines frequently&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000218"></a>Will the complexity of registering with the ISA stop some organisations using volunteers and stop some volunteers from coming forward? Would not the system be more effective if employers were given more responsibility to use their discretion?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000171"></a>Can the Minister update the Committee on the ISA&#146;s IT systems and the IMPACT programme? Can she assure us that it is now operating in every force in the<b></b>country?<b></b>What progress is being made on the correct storage of soft information and intelligence? If not currently, when will IMPACT be fully operational?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000172"></a>There will be online access for both employers and some parents. What progress is being made to ensure that these systems are secure?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90708-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000173"></a>The Minister will be aware of the considerable problems experienced in the United States. Eleven states have experienced problems with security systems leaving sex offenders able to change their own data online. What plans are already in place to ensure that this will not occur in the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000174"></a>Overseas workers remain a real concern. Most EU member states do not have central criminal records. Some 10 per cent of youth and community workers, 15 per cent of care assistants and home carers, 20 per cent of nurses and 10 per cent of teachers are from overseas. The majority are from countries in Asia and Africa that have no system of collecting criminal data centrally. The ISA can include offences committed overseas, but is entirely dependent on the migrants passing on this data themselves. The Government have said that they are developing protocols with 21 countries. How many of these protocols are now in place and operational?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000175"></a>It would be helpful to know why full implementation has been delayed. The extended period of transition caused by these delays requires the ISA and CRB to adopt different procedures and work in different ways over a prolonged period of time until July next year, rather than October this year. Is the Minister confident that implementing the different procedures and work practices in this order, for even longer periods than originally thought necessary, will not create room for error? The new system is complex enough, but we are requiring parallel systems to work over a longer period. The radical changes brought in with the new system could cause chaos without an extensive communication campaign to employers and employees. What is the Minister doing to ensure that this does not occur?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000176"></a>Article 9 of the order modifies Schedule 3 to the Act, regarding automatic barring. This puts in place an interim solution to this issue until legislation comes fully into force. Article 11 modifies Section 113BA of the Police Act to change the information shown on criminal record certificates to show whether a person is eligible to work with children and vulnerable adults, or whether they are being considered for barring. Who will monitor whether that change in the system is  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC236"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC236</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>properly implemented? It is a vital part of the process, and any error in an untried procedure would be unacceptable. How many cases will be affected by these transitional arrangements?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000177"></a>Can the Minister reassure the Committee that the order is compatible with the Convention on Human Rights? The ISA staff can take as evidence not just criminal convictions and cautions but also mere allegations. Even if one has been found innocent beyond all reasonable doubt, the ISA may still come to its own conclusions on whether someone really did commit a crime. The right to work of an estimated 11.3 million people will be determined by the ISA without the protection of a judge or jury. As the Minister will be aware, there are already a number of cases in the courts. Is she aware of the possibility that the Act could unintentionally criminalise individuals? People applying for jobs that are &#147;regulated&#148;&#151;that is, jobs that bring them into indirect contact with children, such as a receptionist at a dental surgery&#151;also need to be registered with the ISA. Will applying for such a job without being registered be a criminal offence?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000178"></a>Why do the Government consistently work from the cynical assumption that the public cannot be trusted to use their own common sense? Why do they not see that what is necessary is greater flexibility and trust? We must ensure that we do not open the door to a whole raft of unintended consequences in our desire to be prescriptive. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000179"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09070899000291"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order. It is a wide-ranging instrument that amends a number of Acts and has a bearing on very many people in different capacities who come into contact with children and vulnerable adults. We welcome measures that make life safer for vulnerable groups, but we seek reassurances that the order will not restrict opportunities for the vulnerable to experience fulfilling and varied lives. If regulations are too stringent, they may deter those who have much to contribute but who hesitate to come forward because of bureaucracy and other deterrents to which the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, referred. Regulations may also incur administration, which takes much needed time and funding away from front-line services.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000180"></a>We have a further general concern about lists, databases and the storage of information, all of which are of great benefit to us all in our everyday lives but can bring great harm if they are inaccurate; if the data are incorrectly analysed or are lost or corrupted, or if they are accessed by unauthorised bodies for use in unauthorised ways. The order amends the criteria for automatic barring which has no right of appeal. Will the Minister assure us that there will be sufficient opportunities for people to correct false or misleading information on their files? What safeguards are in place to ensure that this information will not be used for miscellaneous purposes?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000181"></a>We note that the consultation elicited 326 responses and very high levels of agreement, which gives us confidence that the order will be useful. We also welcome the definition of &#147;relevant child care premises&#148; to exclude,</p>
<ul><a name="09070899000228"></a>&#147;the home of a parent of at least one child to whom the childcare or child minding is provided&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC237"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC237</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09070899000219"></a>It is common sense and for the general good that parents can continue to help each other out in a personal and informal way without needing to be formally registered, and common sense to exempt people in their own homes. It excludes, for example, cleaners employed in the home.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000182"></a>We support the assurance that no fee will be payable by those in unpaid voluntary work&#151;volunteers need every support; they are much needed and they make an invaluable contribution to working with vulnerable people&#151;and that the fee for the Independent Safeguarding Authority scheme applications has been set at &#163;28, which sounds modest enough not to be a barrier. We hope that that will be matched by speed and efficiency in processing applications, although we note that any person checking an individual will be able to do so by means of a quick and free online check and that there will be safety measures to preserve confidentiality. Perhaps the Minister will assure us that confidentiality, too, has been fully assessed.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000183"></a>The size of the workforce affected by the vetting and barring scheme is estimated to be some 11 million strong. This is a very large proportion of the workforce. Will the Minister say how guidance will be communicated to such a large number of people? How can the Government be certain that everyone involved in these amended regulated activities fully understands the implications of the changes, particularly during the transition phase?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000184"></a>We have concerns about the impact of additional regulation and administration on small businesses and the effect on workplace opportunities for young people. The Government are promoting work experience for all young people, not least those in apprenticeships, and it will be challenging to find sufficient places to meet demand. What assurances can the Minister give that these regulations will not be an additional disincentive to hard-pressed employers to take on young people?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000185"></a>My final query relates to the proposal to replace the Protection of Children Act list, the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list, List 99 and the court-imposed disqualification order regime with two separate but aligned lists. If this reduces bureaucracy, it will be welcome, but will the Minister say what the benefits are of this change when set against the costs of reconfiguring and transferring data?</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000186"></a>With those comments and questions, we support the order and look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000188"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09070899000292"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for the opportunity to respond to the many questions following discussion of these important regulations. I hope that I can cover them, but if I find that I cannot, I shall write promptly to both noble Baronesses. Concerns were expressed about the benefits of the enormous commitment and investment that the transition to the new vetting and barring scheme represents. We are clear that the move to the new scheme from the old system is an important step that promotes greater safeguarding. It encompasses changes which came into force in January 2009, the introduction of the new barred list in October 2009 and ISA registration in 2010. These changes will bring clear benefits, in particular the further strengthening of

It will place decisions in the hands of independent experts as opposed to Ministers.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000189"></a>We are widening the workforce covered by automatic barring of those newly convicted or cautioned. We are contributing to a well managed and staged transition to the new vetting and barring scheme.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000190"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09070899000293"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> The Minister mentioned that the experts will make the decisions. Will she explain how they will be selected or appointed, and who they are likely to be?</p>

<p><a name="09070899000191"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09070899000294"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> As the noble Baroness is aware, the Independent Safeguarding Authority is chaired by Sir Roger Singleton and staffed by experienced and expert caseworkers. When the registration scheme is up and running, we will have a system that will be the gold standard for the world. I accept that it is taking us time to achieve it, but when we get there, I wholeheartedly believe that there will be great benefits for employers who will be able to use online facilities to get information proactively about the registration status of their employees. That cannot be done using Criminal Records Bureau checks. While there will be real benefits, the transition from the old to the new system is an enormous undertaking. Noble Lords are entitled to feel sceptical about the process of change, but when we get there, we will have the most comprehensive, efficient and user-friendly system. I appreciate that &#147;user-friendly&#148; is not a phrase one would think of using in connection with vetting and barring, but it is important for employers, volunteers and even for people who may potentially be barred that the whole process is run efficiently.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000192"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was concerned about volunteering. I do not believe that this will create new barriers for volunteers. Bodies such as Volunteering England and the Girl Guides have welcomed the fact that volunteers will be covered by the new scheme in the same way as paid employees. Not to include them could make parents less willing to leave their children with volunteers, or make vulnerable adults more concerned about volunteers who work with them. It is an important step forward, but we need to remember that registration with the ISA will be free of charge for volunteers. Many volunteers are CRB checked at the moment, so the new arrangement builds on that. I accept, though, that this is not widely understood enough in the voluntary sector. The new voluntary sector safeguarding unit that we have established is going to work hard to put that right and ensure that the voluntary and community organisations know how the system will work for them and what the benefits can be.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000193"></a>The noble Baroness is concerned about why the transition is taking its time. We want the transition to the ISA to take place in stages in order to ensure both that it is effective and to maintain high levels of protection for vulnerable groups at every stage. We are determined to get this right, so we are not rushing it. This is a serious task and we need to ensure that the current vetting and barring lists will hold as we transfer to the new arrangements. That is what the regulations are about.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC239"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC239</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000194"></a>Noble Lords wanted to know about the numbers on barred lists at the moment and the numbers that are being migrated. In his Statement on 20 January this year, the Secretary of State announced that there were 12,992 people on List 99. That number had risen from the previous year following the implementation of the amended List 99 regulations that came into force in February 2007 and which this House debated in full. The ISA must include or consider including the new barred lists and all those individuals who are barred under the current lists, as you would expect. We will not be able to give a running commentary on the numbers as the ISA works through the list, but a key point to make is that whether 10 people are left on the current barred lists or 100, we need to ensure that the transitional arrangements are in good order so that we can maintain the bars until the ISA deals with those cases and the new system is fully operational. That is why these regulations are before us.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000195"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was concerned that the arrangements for July will go ahead as planned. We can confirm that the IT systems are on track for delivery in July, and that includes the risk assessment and the security assessment. If she would like me to write to her in more detail&#151;I have a feeling that I will not satisfy her question on security with these answers&#151;I will be happy to do so and copy it to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000196"></a>The question of human rights compliance is very important. Yes, we believe that the order is compliant; it was stated when the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, now an Act, was introduced to Parliament that the scheme would be ECHR-compliant. As noble Lords are aware, we need to follow that procedure when we introduce legislation.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000197"></a>With regard to Criminal Records Bureau checks, the noble Baroness asked who will monitor whether changes to the CRB certificates are implemented effectively. The advice I have here states that the independent monitor applies under the Act, and is referred to in Section 28. Again, I am happy to write to the noble Baroness on this question in order to be absolutely clear.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000198"></a>Noble Lords were interested in whether it would be an offence for, say, a receptionist in a doctor&#146;s surgery not to be ISA-registered and asked whether, as we go through this period of change, we will be criminalising people as they go through their job applications. I want to make it clear that it is not our intention to criminalise people who apply for a job in good faith. As the noble Baroness will be well aware, the question is going to be whether the job is a controlled activity. There will be a duty on the employer to check the registration status of their employees, but an employee does not commit an offence if he or she is not registered. The emphasis is put on the duty of employers to know which roles in their organisations include controlled activities. I hope that that provides reassurance on the point.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000199"></a>I was also asked about timing and when registration for the ISA begins. Registration will begin in 2010. I am sorry, but I shall share something else with the Committee because it is important when considering administrative standards. The aim for those using the system is that 90 per cent will receive their registration  


<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC240"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column GC240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>number about a week after the completed application to the vetting and barring scheme has been received. The advice I have before me is that we are aiming for pretty decent administrative standards so that those who have to engage with the scheme are not left in a state of uncertainty about their registration, provided that they have made the right application.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000200"></a>I want to make a few more points. Concern was expressed about engaging with international protocols. I can confirm that we have an initial agreement with Australia and that we are in ongoing discussions with France and Ireland. This will allow the sharing of criminal records information between our countries. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, is concerned about this, and rightly so. We are keen to forge international agreements so that we can ensure that this information is shared.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000201"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09070899000295"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way. I want to get it clear in my mind that this still means that a large number of people are not going to be covered by the ISA requirements. As an employer, I know that when I take on foreign staff it is very difficult to ensure that all the checks and balances are in place. We go on the say-so of the applicant and there is usually little we can do to check them. My worry is that we will still have within our systems a large number of people working with a lot of vulnerable people who will not have made this application, whereas those here will be overprescribed on application.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000202"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09070899000296"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> The noble Baroness is right. This is where we, the Government, need to be clear. While safe recruiting is extremely important, we can never replace the responsibilities of the employer to ensure that they make use of the vetting and barring scheme when it is fully operational and of Criminal Records Bureau checks. When recruiting from abroad, the employer has a responsibility to seek references and to follow up on as much information as possible. I know that that is very difficult, which is why we are committed to ensuring that we have the protocols to assist employers. We are working hard on that and it is extremely important. I cannot overemphasise the importance of getting bona fide references from foreign employers. I am advised that these are best obtained by the individual, but we will provide guidance to employers and voluntary organisations on the value of the information that should be provided. I cannot stress enough the importance of the point made by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000203"></a>With regard to communication about people&#146;s responsibilities for the ISA, we are running a communications campaign and producing detailed guidance, particularly for the voluntary sector. This will be rolled out from the autumn through to the spring. There is a great deal of work to do on that. We are taking our responsibility for communicating very seriously.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000204"></a>I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, asked about young apprentices.</p>

<p><a name="09070899000205"></a><b><a name="90708-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09070899000297"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> My question was more about whether these extra regulations would deter employers from taking on young people for work experience. Apprenticeships would come into that.</p>

Employers will not be legally required to ISA-register staff who supervise 16 and 17 year-olds in employment. An accommodation has been made of precisely that point.</p>

<a name="90708-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09070899000207"></a>Finally, I will write to noble Lords to ensure that I have covered all their questions. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 is essential legislation in the protection of children and vulnerable adults from harm. The order under discussion amends some details of the Act to improve the practical working of the vetting and barring scheme. By doing so, it paves the way for the Independent Safeguarding Authority to start the full range of barring under the new scheme on 12 October 2009. As we know, the order will

Together, the provisions in this order support the commencement of the full range of barring under the new scheme and the repeal of existing barring schemes, bringing about a further milestone in the transition to the new scheme. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09070877000003"></a><b><a name="90708-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09070877000027"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government &amp; Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Yvette Cooper) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09070877000004"></a>I am pleased to announce that Rita Donaghy has completed the inquiry and I am today able to announce the publication of her report entitled <I>One Death is </I><I>T</I><I>oo Many</I><I>:</I><I> Inquiry into the </I><I>Underlying Causes </I><I>o</I><I>f Construction Fatal Accidents</I>.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09070877000005"></a>I would like to thank Rita (and her peer reviewers) for the thorough way in which she has carried out the inquiry, involving wide consultation with stakeholders.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09070877000006"></a>We know that many in the construction industry work tirelessly to improve health and safety. But more work needs to be done to bring the number of accidents down. This report makes it clear that a culture that expects safe and healthy working and strong leadership is important for delivering further improvements in construction safety. Despite the welcome recent fall  in construction fatalities, any death or major injury is a tragedy for individuals, their families and their colleagues.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09070877000007"></a>The report makes far-reaching recommendations for improving safety in the construction industry, extending across safety representatives, building control, the legal system, training and competence, and public procurement. The Government will now consider the report and its recommendations fully over the summer, working with the industry, trade unions and HSE, before responding later in the year.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09070877000008"></a>Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09070877000009"></a><b><a name="90708-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09070877000028"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Children, Schools and Families (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Schools and Learners (Vernon Coaker) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09070877000010"></a>Strong accountability is essential if we are to help every child to succeed. The Expert Group on Assessment reported that high levels of school accountability are beneficial for everyone who has a stake in the education system, including pupils, parents and the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09070877000011"></a>Externally marked tests play an important role in our accountability system. The expert group confirmed in its report that external validation of pupils&#146; performance is vital and that national curriculum tests remain the best way of providing objective information on the performance of each pupil and each school.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS48"></a><b>8 July 2009 : Column WS48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09070877000012"></a>I am pleased that the great majority of results of 2009 test results, 99.9 per cent, were made available to schools yesterday as planned. Results have successfully been made available to pupils across all subjects, with 99.87 per cent of results available in English, 99.98 per cent in mathematics and 99.85 per cent in science. We will build on this next year and QCA will seek to award a single-year contract for test delivery in 2010, which is similar in shape to this year.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09070877000013"></a>I can confirm that tests in 2010 will take place as planned in the week commencing 10 May. Having taken account of QCA and Ofqual&#146;s advice, we will seek to implement the expert group&#146;s recommendation on moving the test to mid-June in 2011. This will help to strengthen transition arrangements for year 6 pupils; it will also help to embed our Assessment for Learning strategy and the role of teacher assessment.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09070877000014"></a>The efficient delivery of national curriculum tests and implementation of expert group recommendations play an important part in ensuring that a robust accountability system recognises all school outcomes, providing the greatest possible benefit to children, parents and the public.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="09070877000015"></a><b><a name="90708-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09070877000029"></a>The Secretary of State for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Paul Clark) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09070877000016"></a>It is almost a year since the department received the independent report on personnel security in the transport industry by Stephen Boys Smith. Much work has been done since then and I can now give the House an update.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09070877000017"></a>The review was commissioned as a health check on the current arrangements and covered all modes of transport. The review consulted more than 80 stakeholders and the report that emerged contained a detailed assessment of current security processes and recommendations of where changes might be needed. Because of the sensitive nature of the subject matter, the report was not published in full, but a short summary was placed in the Libraries of both Houses and on the department&#146;s website. Relevant sections of the report were issued in full to industry stakeholders.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09070877000018"></a>The report acknowledged that protective security is best applied in multiple layers and noted the importance of the existing physical security regimes. But it also pointed out that, as physical security continues to improve, the potential insider threat is likely to increase, and that, although a number of personnel security measures are already in place, there is a case and scope for incremental change. The overarching message of the report was that the time is right for there to be an increased focus on personnel security and that this should be informed by systematic analysis of the risks. The report also pointed to the need for industry employers to take greater ownership of personnel security, but that the Government have a vital role in providing advice and assistance in mitigating the risks.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09070877000019"></a>We have continued to build on our existing dialogue with the industry with a successful cross-modal conference on 3 October 2008 to discuss how we can collectively improve personnel security in the transport sector. We have established an industry sounding board to help to identify areas of concern  to industry partners and to test emerging ideas and proposals within the programme. Following the report&#146;s central recommendation, we are currently carrying out a programme of risk assessments with industry stakeholders to identify priority areas. The outcomes of the risk assessments will inform the detail of the future programme of work, but much continues to be done in the mean time.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09070877000020"></a>We have produced and issued detailed guidance to employers on operating a voluntary regime of overseas criminal record checks. Also, the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) has produced and published detailed guidance on how overseas criminal record information can be obtained and assessed. We have consulted on the introduction of a mandatory requirement for overseas criminal record checks and I am announcing today that such checks will become mandatory for all new staff in posts that are subject to counterterrorism checks. The necessary regulatory changes will be made mode by mode starting with aviation, where it will become a requirement as of 31 August 2009.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09070877000021"></a>On identity, we have been working with colleagues at CPNI and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to promulgate best practice guidance on verifying documents. We are supporting the work of the Identity and Passport Service in the delivery of improved identity services, including the rollout of national identity cards. Stephen Boys Smith concluded that UK identity cards are a useful addition to identity assurance and we support the decision of the Home Secretary that the objective

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09070877000022"></a>We are examining with industry how best to make use of the range of information available as part of pre-employment checks. We have amended and reissued our regulations to reflect the report&#146;s recommendation that the minimum gap period that should be referenced should be extended from 14 to 28 days.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09070877000023"></a>With regard to national security vetting (NSV), we have been engaged in wider discussions across government about the development of NSV policy and process, with the aim of making it more efficient. The department has increased the resources allocated to this area and is actively exploring other options, including contracting work to other vetting service providers.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09070877000024"></a>We have reiterated to industry the need for personnel security measures to be applied down the contracting chain and are exploring how best to use existing inspection regimes to monitor and enforce this.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09070877000025"></a>Personnel security post-recruitment is very important and we are working with colleagues across government to ensure that policies and practice relating to existing employees are consistent, fair and robust. CPNI has published guidance for employers on handling approaches about their staff from security agencies, and DfT is working to establish agreed protocols for the handling of cases where there are security concerns about individuals already in post.</p>

<a name="90708-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09070877000026"></a>Finally, we are working with industry and CPNI to ensure that personnel security guidance is appropriately disseminated and focused on the requirements of its intended audience. The department is considering ways in which this guidance can be tailored to reflect the variety in the scale and structure of companies in the transport industry.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09070878000007"></a>The proposed family advocacy scheme in the consultation proposes paying the same fee for the same work regardless of whether the advocate is a self employed, or in-house barrister or solicitor, and we proposed an intermediate rate which we believe is fair to all advocates. The scheme includes higher fees for more complex work: for example, by paying for additional interim hearings or paying extra for lengthy final hearings. Some respondents to the consultation were concerned that the proposed scheme did not contain sufficient graduation to reward more complex cases. The LSC has been working closely with stakeholders on further development of the scheme. It is likely that the final scheme will have more graduation and complexity, than that originally proposed.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a><a name="09070878000018"></a>The figures are based upon average pensions paid to former members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and dependants. These averages are not comparable because of different lengths of service, different rank structure between the Brigade of Gurkhas and the wider Army and, chiefly, because Gurkhas begin drawing on their pensions much earlier than British soldiers with equivalent service. For example, a Gurkha rifleman or corporal with 15 years&#146; service (approximately 85 per cent of those receiving GPS payments) can claim an immediate pension after 15 years&#146; service (from age 33) whereas equivalent service under the AFPS would not attract pension payments until age 60.</p>
