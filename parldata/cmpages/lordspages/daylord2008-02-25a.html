I assure him that these proposals have been the subject of a consultation, on which no final decisions have been taken. Perhaps I may refer him to Lord Justice Carnwath, the Senior President of Tribunals, who has made it clear that one of his principal objectives in the coming months will be to ensure that the changes do not come at the expense of continuity, specialisation or service to users. The proposals are an attempt to use the undoubted strengths of the current Pensions Appeal Tribunal, but within a larger and more integrated approach to tribunals generally.</p>

How do the Government intend to use across the board the armed services members, who are currently an essential part of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal but who obviously could not be used in any other capacity? Those members give confidence to servicemen that the people listening to them know about service life.

Up to now, the Royal British Legion has had a special agreement with the PAT to provide people for specific meetings and tribunals when major issues are at stake, but it will be unable to run all over the country attending all sorts of large tribunals. These issues will be one small bit of the system, but they are nevertheless vital to the armed services.

There has been analysis of the Olympic budget at the highest level. In this analysis, where anxieties have been expressed, for instance with regard to the security budget, I can report that the contingency provision for the security budget is three times higher than the original allocation of resources for security. We are taking on board the fact that there could be significant increases in certain areas, but these were all included in the &#163;9.325 billion budget, which was announced in March last year.

The noble Lord will appreciate that there have been suggestions that there is a failure to project accurately the returns that may occur after 2012. We are in difficult areas here because we are projecting land values. All of us will recognise that there are problems with regard to projection in those terms.

There is no argument about what can be done with the waste, including catering waste. In 1999, swill feeders were banned from using airline waste food and non-GB food. They were also banned from putting dead piglets in pigswill. The complete ban put in place in 2001 and subsequently across the European Union in 2003 means that an enormous amount of food waste is unfortunately going to landfill where it will pollute the planet.

They spent many thousands of pounds setting themselves up and their businesses were peremptorily closed by the Government at the start of foot and mouth disease outbreak.

That was part of the reason for bringing in the complete ban. It was suggested before 1997. Steps were taken in 1999 to make certain reductions. That is not the issue. There is no analogy with the fur farmers and others who were completely put out of business. There is business in waste and in trading in waste. I fully accept that while the equipment was there for the boilers, pigs can be fed other materials and the waste can still create a lot of money for people unless they put it into landfill.</p>

We know that poultry and livestock consume large quantities of cereals. Does the noble Lord not agree that it is time to reconsider the ban on swill feeding and devise methods of using the one-third of food that is gown in the UK and currently classified as waste?</p>

SEAC has never changed its advice on this&#151;it does not matter what you do to the material or how well you might cook it, inter-species feeding in this way is not a good idea. We do not want to turn the clock back on that. The noble Lord is quite right: one-third of the food that we sell and produce is not used. It is wasted, but it should not go to landfill. There are other ways of getting money and energy out of that waste food.</p>

The swill was made on a different farm from the one where foot and mouth started. I do not know whether that particular feed&#151;or, indeed, feed around the country&#151;was tested for foot and mouth. Obviously, as the noble Countess said, there were some two dozen swill feeders. There are 62 members of the swill users&#146; group, but I do not know whether all 62 were producing feed at the time. I will provide a written answer on this, but it does not alter the fact that we will give a considered reply to the ombudsman&#146;s thorough report, which did not find in favour of six of the seven complaints made.</p>

Would he not agree that steps must be taken to ensure that we remain in a pre-eminent position? This Northern Rock scandal has been running for six months and if it has not done any damage at home, which I doubt, it will undoubtedly have done some damage abroad. What steps will be taken to ensure that our reputation does not suffer? Furthermore, what proposals are there for the Granite trust, which is run from the Channel Islands and is apparently a subsidiary of Northern Rock? Finally, in hindsight, would it not have been a good idea to have done a deal with Lloyds-TSB last August?</p>

That has been the burden of the Government&#146;s intent ever since Northern Rock presented the problem and why the Government have made strenuous efforts to solve it over the past six months. The Bill passed last week represents the conclusion of those efforts so far as immediate action is concerned.</p>

<a name="80225-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0802253000061"></a>On the other points, as I mentioned last week, Granite is entirely separate from Northern Rock. However, later today a statement will be made on Granite to cover a number of points that have been raised. I am not able to go beyond that at this immediate moment.</p>

Despite all the events of the recent past, both direct and portfolio investment is still pouring into the City and our reputation as the leading financial centre has not been lowered either here or abroad. What one would like to hear is a bit more support for the City of London and for the British economy rather than carping criticism.</p>

London produces resources from its financial services twice as large as any other financial centre, and of course we value that.

It has to produce a business plan that meets the requirements of the European Commission and it has to meet the proper requirements to ensure that it does not enjoy an unfair competitive advantage&#151;for which the Government will also take responsibility. The House will recognise the time constraint of 17 March as regards Brussels, but the Government will want to see how the strategic plan of the relationship between the Treasury and Northern Rock develops, and of course it will be put into the public domain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0802253000096"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, for those who were not able to be in Grand Committee last Thursday, perhaps it would be helpful if I just mentioned the three points that were raised regarding Wiltshire&#146;s objection to the order. The first was cost; the consensus is that Wiltshire County Council has grossly underestimated the cost. The second point, which is the substantive one with regard to my amendment, relates to acceptance. Prior to the consultation, the second objective of all these orders was stated to be that the proposals must be,</p>
<ul><a name="0802253000231"></a>&#147;supported by a broad cross section of partners and stakeholders&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000097"></a>In the discussion that the noble Baroness and I had in Grand Committee last Thursday, she was kind enough to acknowledge, having twice stressed that one-third of the respondents from Wiltshire had been in favour of the plan, that two-thirds had been against the plan. I just point out to the Minister that two-thirds is twice as much as one-third. That is fairly simple mathematics, which even somebody like me can cope with.</p>

<a name="80225-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0802253000098"></a>The two boroughs in question are not in Wiltshire, but the result of the court case will affect all these orders, so I hope that I am allowed to speak on Wiltshire&#146;s behalf by referring to Congleton and Shrewsbury and Atcham. The position as I understand it&#151;I do not speak as a lawyer&#151;is that the case went to court in September and Mr Justice Underhill upheld the Government&#146;s case on all three grounds. However, the councils were granted leave to appeal.</p>

<a name="80225-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0802253000099"></a>I come back to one of the original objectives, which was to achieve broad consensus. The councils argued that the original wording meant that there must be support for a proposal before it could go forward to implementation. The Secretary of State changed that to claim that, if the proposals were implemented, the support would be forthcoming afterwards. This is slightly curious. The court conceded that the criteria had been changed but claimed that the Secretary of State was entitled to change her mind on the criteria as the process unfolded. The plaintiffs argued that such a claim was contrary to the concept of legitimate expectations.</p>

<a name="80225-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0802253000100"></a>I realise that this is sub judice and that it is completely inappropriate to go into the pros and cons of the case itself. The noble Baroness advised the Grand Committee last Thursday that, although the appeal was heard at the end of January, that we do not know the result yet. However, she was kind

That is less than four weeks away. The purpose of my amendment is strongly to ask the Government: what is the hurry for the sake of four weeks?</p>

<a name="80225-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0802253000101"></a>This Government are not the only Government to have found themselves with a slightly bloody nose vis- -vis judgments from the courts and having to reverse what I would call political decisions. I really think that it might help the Government if they just held hard the matter for four weeks and waited on the result of the appeal; then, everyone will know exactly where they stand.

The Government have told us on a number of occasions that they are seeking consensus, particularly in going forward to find the new composition of this House. They are conducting themselves in that regard as though consensus existed in favour of a proportion of elected people in this House, which does not exactly represent the views of the vast majority of the House. So, coloured by that experience, I look at this case and find&#151;my noble friend has reminded me&#151;that the Government were seeking to proceed by general consensus. They find that two-thirds of those consulted are against what is proposed, and yet they proceed as though consensus has been obtained. It is the same behaviour pattern.</p>

<a name="80225-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0802253000104"></a>The matter becomes more serious when one finds that one of the grounds of appeal was that all the links that the DCLG put on the website on this consultation went only to people in favour of it and not to those against. So there seems to be a determination to go ahead with policy in all areas as if consensus has been achieved when it has not. To do that ahead of a judgment that may overturn the decision that the Government are now trying to implement seems to be to take a considerable risk with their own popularity rating as well as to be a great waste of parliamentary time if the whole thing has to be done again. I therefore warmly support my noble friend.</p>

First, there has been no suggestion at any stage in dealing with any of these orders that consensus means the result of a plebiscite. Local government reorganisation, whether in 1974 or David Curry&#146;s reorganisation in the 1990s, did not seek public opinion particularly strongly. The reason for that seems to me to be twofold. First, some of the authorities may have to have changed boundaries. Where people in, for example, a rural area may come within an expanded  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_443"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 443</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>boundary, they enjoy urban services at a much lower cost because they are paying rural rates. In a completely non-judgmental way, I would point out that they are essentially piggy-backing on urban services for which they have not fully paid. To expect them to want to vote to come into such a system would be utopian at best. My second hesitation about talk about plebiscites and referendums is that consensus is not just about each individual council tax payer or each taxpayer, because local communities are made up of networks of interest&#151;the churches, the faith groups and, above all, business&#151;and it is business that in many areas has been driving this agenda for unitary authorities. As a result, you cannot pick up those community voices through a plebiscite.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0802253000106"></a>As my noble friend made clear when we discussed this in Grand Committee, it will be a pragmatic judgment whether the key stakeholders, together with the principal players&#151;that is, the local authorities&#151;would make the proposed unitary authorities work. My noble friend was confident that, in Wiltshire&#146;s case, they would, and went on to explain that the judge at that appeal said that it was perfectly appropriate and proper for the Government to go ahead and not to defer their activities to await any outcome of the formal decision.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0802253000107"></a>My second point is that if my noble friend were to accept this amendment, or the House were to support it, that would mean that any individual of any party to any such order&#151;we have a dozen or so of them coming our way, including some quite difficult ones in a week or two&#151;could seek to delay and delay again by going through the court procedure. When, as here, the judge has clearly made it acceptable to go ahead and the Government won on all points of the first round, there is, presumably, nothing to prevent these local authorities from delaying yet again by taking the matter on to the House of Lords. We could end up delaying each system of change by months when the staff, the stakeholders and the electorate want us to go swiftly and seamlessly into the new authorities. On both those grounds, I hope that the House will not support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes.</p>

I therefore thank my noble friend Lord Geddes for giving me this unexpected opportunity to speak to his amendment. I shall not abuse that opportunity by making last Thursday&#146;s speech, but I should tell the House that I speak, as Lord Geddes did, as a resident. I lived in north Wiltshire for five years, then in central Wiltshire for 17 years; I have now been in south Wiltshire for 12 years. I can therefore endorse the view that Wiltshire is a highly diverse county that is ill suited in its physical topography or human geography to a unitary authority.</p>

The Government make much of their consultation with stakeholders, yet, at the time of the Commons debate on 5 February, only one stakeholder was known to have been positively in favour. At first blush, the democratic statistics are against the Government. The Minister was a little free with personal parliamentary statistics on Thursday when she described admiration for the leader of the council among county MPs who were against the proposal but spoke of their warmth towards her.  Of those who alluded to the leader in their speeches on 5 February, the Minister&#146;s statement is correct of one; the only other one who spoke of her could not make up his mind whether he was in favour of or against the proposal. That seems not a bad summary of overall opinion in the county, incidentally, but it is a poor basis for going forward, for which the Government must therefore take full responsibility thereafter.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0802253000110"></a>Governments of both major parties have had a curate&#146;s egg reputation for their central government decisions about local government since, 40 years ago, they started relying on Ministers who did not have local government experience. My noble friend Lord Geddes is giving the Government the opportunity to wait for the court&#146;s views on the analogous Shropshire case before finalising their views by pressing the  order today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0802253000111"></a>As for the boundaries to which the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, alluded, in Wiltshire we had re-warding boundaries in 2003 and new parliamentary constituency boundaries in the interim; we are now to be asked to have all our local government boundaries altered again. As moonrakers, Wiltshiremen on the whole like a bit of peace and quiet.</p>

However, I was struck by something that he said about awaiting a decision affecting both Wiltshire and Congleton Borough Council. I will be taking the opportunity to oppose what the Government propose for Cheshire next Tuesday, but my attention was drawn by the words not only of that noble Lord but of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0802253000113"></a>It is absolutely imperative that, if we are to carry these orders&#151;and, indeed, the order for Cheshire&#151;the criterion of consensus that the Government have demanded is reflected in the ability of the people in these counties to pronounce on them.

It is all the more frustrating because the difficulties with which local government reorganisation is now beset were predictable; indeed, they were predicted by these Benches when the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill was going through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0802253000116"></a>Discussions with the local authorities concerned began long before the Bill was published and took place within a framework that changed every time the Minister in another place changed&#151;I think that there were three in charge while this was taking place. Above all, there has never really been any clear vision expressed for the future of local government beyond a rather vague &#147;one tier good, two tier bad&#148; mantra. We have not seen any robust analysis of the performance of local government in order to determine how it should be structured to provide good services, to be cost-efficient and to command public support.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0802253000117"></a>It is all very well to say&#151;as the Government have and, I have no doubt, as the noble Baroness will again today&#151;that this was a bottom-up process, but the fact is that central government will decide the outcome of the local government review. Therefore, it is the responsibility of central government to have a framework providing clear ground rules and to have a transparent process that tests out financial claims and verifies claims about public support.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0802253000118"></a>But we are where we are. We do not know when we can expect the outcome of the appeal against the judicial review. We do not know whether it will affect the outcome of the councils directly concerned, never mind the other councils involved in the process, such as Wiltshire. These councils are providing essential services such as education, social care and firefighting. Some of the councils face elections in just 11 weeks&#146; time. The noble Lord asks what the hurry is. This process has already been hugely disruptive for local councils. To create more uncertainty going on for weeks and weeks could damage public services. Therefore, it is with some reluctance and with genuine sympathy, because the Government have handled this very badly, that we shall not support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

I have also heard about Cheshire and I know about Northumberland. I think that this is a very sorry way to carry on. My noble friend is absolutely right: we are going to have elections in Northumberland in eight weeks, as will others. The people of Northumberland, despite not liking much of what was going on, recognised that we could not stop it, so we are doing our best to make sure that it will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0802253000120"></a>In all the debates that we have had, this has been very unsatisfactory and undemocratic. It was even worse in Northumberland; we had a referendum in which people said what they would like but the Government responded, &#147;Oh, that does not matter; the chief constable and others want this to happen&#148;. The Government have moved forward paying scant regard to democracy. This will be played out, in some cases, in the reorganisations. In Northumberland, it is the officers who are pushing this forward until the new council is elected. It is time that the Government thought carefully about how our democracy works. They have played fast and loose with it and they are now setting up all sorts of bodies that have no democratic accountability and are not going to be any better.</p>

I have listened intently to what noble Lords have said. We had a good debate on Thursday. We debated each of the orders in turn and went into considerable detail. Indeed, I wearied the Committee by going through the processes at some length, so I will not repeat all that.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0802253000122"></a>I am disappointed by what the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said. The Government have not been less than honest. We made what we were looking for very clear in the criteria that we set out. I remind the House that this was the first time in all the reorganisations of the past 40 years that the Government offered an invitation to local authorities to tell us whether they were interested in change. Yes, we made a case for unitary status, but it is the case that many people throughout the land have made. Many local councils and district councils have also made that case. We forced this on nobody. We set out our criteria clearly.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0802253000123"></a>We had 26 invitations and six have gone through. We have failed far more people and councillors on their proposals because they did not meet our criteria; they did not meet the financial criteria and they did not meet the broad support criteria. That is why we feel confident that the unitary structures that we now support&#151;these five orders&#151;are workable. That is the point.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0802253000124"></a>Noble Lords are absolutely right to raise the question of the criteria for broad support. I will quote the criteria in the original invitation, because what we were looking for was clear. We said that the change to unitary local government structure must be,</p>
<ul><a name="0802253000232"></a>&#147;supported by a broad cross section of partners and stakeholders ... We recognise that any proposal may not carry consensus from or within all sectors ... No single body or group of councils or bodies will have a veto&#148;.</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0802253000214"></a>&#147;It will be necessary for any proposal to have support from a range of key partners, stakeholders and service users/citizens&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0802253000125"></a>In any reorganisation people are unhappy, particularly if their council is not going to survive. We know that this has caused distress and disappointment. I listened with great respect to what the noble Lords, Lord Brooke, Lord Elton and Lord Geddes, said about Wiltshire and their personal associations with it. They are right to make the House aware of those matters. However, we were never less than clear that we could not look for a majority of popular support, for the reasons that my noble friend made clear. We were looking for the sort of support that would ensure that this reorganisation would work to the benefit of the local people, with more strategic leadership and more neighbourhood empowerment. We have found that the local arrangements that are being set up&#151;as in the case of &#147;belonging communities&#148; in Northumberland or in Cornwall&#151;are real local associations rather than artificial boundaries. There will be a new way; this will not just be a reiteration or a reformation of an old council. That is why it is important to get it right.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0802253000126"></a>In Wiltshire, there was a popular poll, which the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, quoted correctly. It was a postal campaign. We commissioned work into the nature of these polling campaigns in other places. They were not managed by the Electoral Reform Society. They were not supervised; the votes were merely collected at the end. There was not the supervision that we would expect in terms of a national postal vote. Consequently, we are saying that one has to be very careful about the value of that sort of vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0802253000127"></a>At the same time in Wiltshire, an Ipsos MORI poll revealed that 80 per cent of people were looking for more information about the benefits of unitary councils and structures, which is a slightly different perspective. We had the support of many public sector stakeholders, some of the voluntary and community sector and most of the Wiltshire business chambers. We were looking for the partners to be signed up to this proposal so that, when and if Parliament agreed it, it would be delivered. The partners would see the new strategic arrangements and the new governance arrangements; they would be working with them, they would be committed to delivering them and they would make them work. We started off there&#151;from the principles of validity, accountability and workability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0802253000128"></a>Let me say in response to what the noble Lord said that, as my noble friend stated, we are in a clear position in relation to the courts. In September, the court found conclusively in favour of the Government. It dismissed Congleton&#146;s and Shrewsbury&#146;s claim for judicial review on all grounds. It also gave leave for the parties to appeal, but the court made no suggestion whatever that the administrative processes should be delayed pending that appeal.</p>

At the start of this process last spring, during the permission hearing, the court refused an application from Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council and Congleton Borough Council to stay the process until the outcome of the judicial review. In refusing the application, Mr Justice King explained that,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0802253000130"></a>The noble Lord will not be surprised that I cannot accept the amendment, which takes a diametrically opposite view to that of the court and seeks to put a hold on the process pending the outcome of the litigation, when we are now awaiting the decision of the Court of Appeal. As I have explained, the High Court, conscious of the process and the timetable involved in the structural changes, recognised at the very outset of this litigation the importance of pressing ahead and not holding back the administrative process for restructuring. Secondly, we gave every assurance to local authorities from the outset of the process that we would try not to drag this process out and make it more difficult. I do not know when the judgment on appeal will be given. The best we can say is that we expect that it will be given  before the Easter Recess, but that is entirely a matter for the court.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0802253000131"></a>The implications for delay are very serious for councils and for the implementation process. This has been done in extensive consultation with the local authorities concerned about what they wanted, the timetable of elections that they wanted to follow and the nature of the implementation teams. Everything has been in their hands. The timetable that Wiltshire, like other areas, is now following, with the agreement of all parties, is for new elections in May 2009. That allows sufficient time for the Electoral Commission to undertake the necessary electoral review before the May 2009 election. If the noble Lord&#146;s judgment were to prevail today and the court upheld its original judgment, on the Electoral Commission&#146;s timetable that review would no longer be possible.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0802253000132"></a>The problems and confusion of such a delay more than outweigh, in our judgment, the problems and costs that would arise if an order were now approved and made but subsequently quashed by the court if it were to grant the appeal. We have to bear in mind the fact that, even if the court does grant the appeal,  it is entirely at its discretion whether to quash the order or simply to make a declaration or grant some other relief.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0802253000133"></a>I know that the noble Lord has spoken with what he sees as the interests of Wiltshire at heart and that other noble Lords have raised important issues. However, I hope that he will agree with Members in another place that, given the decision to go ahead&#151;and without denying that there have been and always have been disagreements and upset over this sort of change&#151;we must support those who have come through the process and are now committed to implementing those changes and making them work as successfully as possible. I think that it would be a major disservice to those very loyal servants in local government if they were not able to do that.</p>

<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="0802253000134"></a><b><a name="80225-0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0802253000641"></a>Lord Geddes:</b> My Lords, I am immensely grateful to my noble friends and other noble Lords for their support of my amendment. I will just make a couple of points to the Minister.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0802253000135"></a>First, on the crucial issue of consensus, which several noble Lords have raised, the Minister used a very interesting phrase. She said that the Government &#147;forced this on nobody&#148;. However, that is exactly what is happening now in Wiltshire&#151;and probably other counties as well, but I am concentrating on Wiltshire. It is exactly what is happening: this is being forced on the people of Wiltshire. It was not achieved by plebiscite; I do not why the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has brought up that word again after doing so last Thursday. My honourable friend the Member for Westbury said in col. 924 of Commons <I>Hansard</I> of  5 February that he has photocopies of every response. I do not know whether the noble Baroness or her officials have seen those copies, but they are readily available. Two-thirds of the respondents in Wiltshire said that they did not want this. By any common use of English, that seems to me to be forcing a decision on the people of Wiltshire.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0802253000136"></a>The Minister mentioned the MORI poll. I put no weight on it at all but, as she has mentioned it, I will, too. If I heard her correctly, she said that 80 per cent of the respondents would like to know the benefits of the unitary authority. I bet they would&#151;so would I&#151;but that does not mean that they will agree with them. It is plain common sense to want to find out what the benefits are of this thing that is being proposed. I cannot argue with that.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0802253000137"></a>On the issue of the timetable, I am not an expert in local government, but it beggars belief that a pause of four weeks will put Wiltshire&#146;s local elections in May 2009 into jeopardy. However, the noble Baroness has said that the judgment will be before Easter. Adding up on my fingers and my toes, I can say that that is less than four weeks. I find it extremely hard to believe that four weeks will make that amount of difference.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0802253000138"></a>Sadly, I do not think that there are enough people here to warrant my testing the opinion of the House. It is with great reluctance, therefore, that I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0802253000143"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment received a hesitant response when it was first proposed in Committee because there seemed to be a great deal of uncertainty surrounding some of the wording. After much reflection, we feel that it is essential to bring the amendment back and I hope that I will be able to allay any of the previous concerns and anxieties.</p>

<a name="80225-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0802253000144"></a>As we consider all the amendments at this stage of the Bill, I hope that it is unnecessary to remind the House to keep in mind the historic nature of this legislation. No other country is passing legislation of this scope to tackle climate change. This is the first legislation of its kind and because of its purpose&#151;its aim&#151;it could be a model for legislatures and parliaments around the world. Other countries have laws on emissions; most developed nations are signatories on countless treaties, accords and protocols. However, what sets this Bill apart is that it is one country&#146;s attempt to address and curb the entire scope of its domestic emissions in order to decrease global emissions&#151;that is, it is one country&#146;s attempt to do its part to stop climate change.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80225-0004.htm"/>


<a name="80225-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0802253000145"></a>Our amendment ensures that this true purpose is reflected in the Bill. As I mentioned in Committee, the Bill, not our speeches and assurances in the Chamber, will show our intention. I trust that there is no disagreement in the House that this is to stop global warming, and thus on our side we feel that it is of the utmost importance to frame the decisions and actions that the Bill will lead to in their true and appropriate context.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0802253000146"></a>The Minister told the House in Committee that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0802253000219"></a>&#147;The UK remains committed to the European Union&#146;s  2 degree target, but there is no simple relationship between that target and the UK&#146;s 2050 target&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/12/07; col. 130.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000203"></a>That seems a curious statement. All the evidence that we have received suggests that carbon emissions are leading to global warming. There might not be a simple relationship, but there is certainly a very important one. If it is not the 2 degree target, then what is behind the 60 per cent emissions reductions target, apart from an outdated scientific report? We understand that this is not a precise science. We understand that we cannot control all of the globe&#146;s emissions. We take the point that even if global emissions stopped today, there would be no guarantee that we will not exceed the  2 degree target. Yet we still think that we should be committed to doing our part in trying.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0802253000147"></a>Even the Government seem to think so, as the Minister told us in relation to the EU&#146;s 2 degree target, which he claimed in Committee had the full commitment of the Government. Why have the Government committed to a target in the EU that they will not commit to at home in the Bill? We hope that he will provide an explanation before trying to persuade us of the problems associated with a  2 degree target.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0802253000148"></a>One of the challenges to our previous amendment was that the Bill was not the place for general objectives of this kind. I could continue, as I have done, by stressing the unique and historic nature of  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_451"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Bill which requires new measures and new provisions. There is a clear precedent for stating such principles&#151;the Sustainable Communities Act begins by stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0802253000220"></a>&#147;The principal aim of this Act is to promote the sustainability of local communities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000204"></a>Having a principal aim anchors policy around a central theme. This legislation creates a multitude of new powers and has a scope that will affect policymakers all over Whitehall. It must do that if it is going to succeed. Having the principal aim stated in the Bill will colour and shape the way that the Act works in practice. It is not intended to provide a test for individual decisions. Judges would not apply this as an applicable statutory test for individual cases. However, the amendment places a general duty that can be evaluated and has regard to way in which the functions under the Act are exercised. This would certainly be a consideration in any judicial review challenging a particular decision or action, for example, as to whether regard had been given to all relevant considerations and that the decision or action had been taken in a reasonable and rational way.</p>

The key is that the primary purpose of the Bill is not to seek carbon emissions reductions but to effect climate change. It is called the Climate Change Bill, not the carbon emissions Bill. It is our argument&#151;a substantial one&#151;that the new clause should be included in the principal aim of the Bill because that is what the Bill seeks to do.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0802253000151"></a>I believe that a consideration would be made as to whether a particular action was reasonable or rational in terms of the nature of the Bill. Essentially the Government have put similar general aims on other legislation and have committed themselves to the specific aim of a 2 degree target in Europe. It is difficult to understand the Government&#146;s reticence to be bold and place their noble intentions in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

There is a duty on us legislators to make legislation clear and obvious to the public&#151;the electors and citizens of this country. One of the best quality ways to do that is to state in plain language what the legislation is about. The amendment would do precisely that; it says what the Bill is about. Considering what the Government have said about the Bill, they are in many ways selling themselves short in how it has been presented not only to us but to the world community in terms of its objectives and what we are trying to achieve. It is not as if the Government are not absolutely clear about what the degree change should be. The Prime Minister,  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_452"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in his speech on 19 November when he comprehensively laid out for the first time his environmental credentials, described the 2 degree target as one that was an &#147;overriding&#148; mission. That was the word he used. If that is the case, what better place to put it than at the beginning of the Bill? For all those reasons, that objective should be at the front of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0802253000153"></a>Will the 2 degrees cause problems to the Committee on Climate Change, which has to take that into account and which will give it greater clarity in its own work? Is it too small or too large to ask for? When I was travelling here on the train, I went through the fourth IPCC assessment report for policymakers, which describes the sort of changes that can happen with just a  2 degrees centigrade change. Perhaps I could remind your Lordships&#146; House of some of them. The first is aridity&#151;greater dryness and desertification&#151;on the globe. The one that really struck me is the much greater risk that 30 per cent of species could become extinct; that there will be an increase in malnutrition and infectious diseases; and that cereal growth will be retarded at mid and low latitudes. The factor that really came over to me was one that the IPCC coolly describes as water stress. That sounds very innocent, but the IPCC says that hundreds of millions of people on this planet will suffer more from water stress. Is that as a result of a 4-degree, a 5-degree or a 10-degree increase? No, it is a result of this 2-degree increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0802253000154"></a>Another thing has changed almost since the start of Committee some time ago. I was quite sceptical about the scare stories of discontinuities as a result of climate change, whether in relation to ocean currents, whole ice sheets disappearing or major extinctions of species. Even since then, it is quite clear from reading the scientific press that there is a great deal more uncertainty about when those things, the effects of which we can never reverse, will happen. That is why 2 degrees is so important, and why it needs to be stated clearly in the Bill, for Britain and the global community, where we, and I hope the Government, stand.</p>

What exactly does it mean? I assume that it means pre the industrial revolution, which took place over an extremely extended period of decades or even centuries in different countries at different times. Indeed, it has not been going for very long in India and China, so I ask the noble Lord to explain, if he can, precisely what &#147;pre-industrial levels&#148; is meant to mean.</p>

It is misconceived for two reasons. First, as the noble Lord has just said, the notion that defining a temperature 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels is the right temperature is entirely without basis. The world&#146;s temperature, as we know, has gone up  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_453"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 453</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and down through large ranges over history, and the notion that we can define a temperature as the optimum temperature is without basis.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0802253000157"></a>Secondly, I certainly question the notion that the science is sufficiently defined for us to be able to define what level of carbon emissions would produce any particular effect on the Earth&#146;s temperature, or indeed whether those would be the primary driver of any change in the Earth&#146;s temperature. There is so much uncertainty about both the level and the quantity of change that would result from any particular set of emissions that to build into a Bill a set of objectives that try to define emissions to achieve some precise notion of temperature change again fails to take account of the unrealities and the uncertainties in the science backing this. With much regret, therefore, I do not think that the amendment is appropriate, although I understand the motives behind it. I suspect that a number of other noble Lords will find it difficult to support the Conservative Front Bench on this one.</p>

It is important to avoid in the description of the Bill anything that is controversial. So far as I can see, the amendment is entirely irrelevant. There is no legal requirement to spell out in legal terms what the Bill is about. That is important so far as the speeches are concerned, particularly on Second Reading. My noble friend has told the House exactly how important the Bill is, but I add another caveat. We are setting a very dubious precedent if we describe this Bill in the form that this amendment permits. In particular, it inevitably invokes a controversy, which we have witnessed already. For that reason, the Bill goes in the right direction and I oppose this amendment for the reasons I have said and for the reasons which have been articulated.</p>

First, I very much agree on the importance of this Bill. I am conscious of how much the Bill is supported internationally and of how much international interest there is in it, as I discovered at a meeting of the G8 plus five parliamentarians on climate change in Brazil last week.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0802253000160"></a>I support, too, very much the inclusion of the principal aim in this Bill and in other Bills. I agree, too, on the need for ambitious targets, but it seems to me that targets should be supported by the science and be within the capacity of the British Government to achieve. Amendment No. 3, standing in the name of the noble Lords, Lord Teverson and Lord Redesdale, meets both those tests, and I will be happy to support that amendment. But this amendment seems to meet only the first test. It is wholly conceivable that a target of 60 per cent or 80 per cent might be met, but that it could still be above the 2 degrees because of the action, or inaction, of others, which would put the Government of the day in an almost impossible position.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0802253000161"></a>I would have supported a principal aim, framed in more general terms, such as to take action to avoid dangerous or irreversible climate change, but I cannot support an amendment which includes the specific aim of the 2 degrees.</p>

As framed, the amendment proposes that UK emissions aim to be set at a level to ensure that global emissions are not more than 2 degrees. In effect, if the United States, China and others decide to make little or no effort, what will be required by the United Kingdom will be truly astronomic. The amendment would put those countries which decide to make an effort in an almost impossible position and there would be little or no pressure on other countries to make that effort. As the noble Lord, Lord Jay, said, this is something with which I entirely agree, but it is an amendment that has to be opposed.</p>

It seems to me technically flawed that the mention of 2 degrees appears at only one point in the Bill. Currently, the Bill has a target specified in greenhouse gases as parts per million, followed by a number of procedures to reconsider that over time on the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. But there seems to be no such mechanisms in relation to this 2 degrees. If, over time, scientific opinion changes upwards or downwards, we are left with 2 degrees in the Bill. If this is to be adopted, a whole series of consequential changes have to be made to allow for advice and reconsideration. For the reasons that noble Lords have put forward, it would be better for this not to be in the Bill.</p>

During our previous discussions, I set out the Government&#146;s concerns, which still stand, about proposals to add a purpose clause. I shall give several reasons why, many of which have been given probably more succinctly in the past few minutes. First, to go to the heart of the way in which we do legislation in this country, we are not legislating for the rest of the planet or for the European Union; we are legislating for the United Kingdom. General purpose clauses are generally unnecessary in UK legislation. I do not say that they have not occurred&#151;examples have been given and I could give some myself&#151;but they are generally unnecessary and we think that the purpose of the Bill is already clear. The proposed new clauses do not work. Although we are debating Clause 1, it is in some ways linked to other opposition amendments. We are dealing with it on its own at the moment. The underlying concerns that have prompted the amendment will be met anyway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0802253000165"></a>General purpose clauses are unnecessary. First, while there are exceptions, very few pieces of UK legislation have special purpose clauses because we legislate by drafting clearly, and interpreting through Parliament as best we can, so that it is crystal clear. Obviously, it is interpreted by the courts later. The system works very well and has done so for a long time. In our system of statutory law, primary legislation is drafted so that Parliament goes through it line by line, as we are doing here, teasing out ambiguities and complexities, so that the powers, duties and prohibitions contained in the  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_455"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill can be clearly understood and applied in a practical way. The courts then interpret on that basis. There is a fundamental difference between legislation setting out a purpose for a particular body or set of bodies, and a purpose for a piece of legislation as a whole. That is why some of the past examples that may be given do not quite square with this one.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0802253000166"></a>A purpose clause for a piece of legislation as a whole is only relevant when the legislation is ambiguous. Generally speaking, UK legislation is designed not to be ambiguous, and this Bill is no exception. The powers, duties and prohibitions in this Bill are clear. If some parts around the margins are not, they will be clear by the time it has gone through this House and another place. That is why there is no need at all for a special purpose clause. There is obviously a desire in parts of your Lordships&#146; House to make clear statements of principle. I have to remind the House that the Bill is about making law. It is not pulling a paragraph out of a manifesto onto the statute book, which is how this could be interpreted because of the reference to &#147;pre-industrial&#148; and the rigidity of 2 degrees. There is that issue: it is not normally the way we do it. It was much criticised in the still very influential report on the drafting of legislation, which I remember being introduced in the other place by Sir David Renton, later Lord Renton, in 1975. Nothing has changed since then, as he constantly reminded us.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0802253000167"></a>Secondly, the Bill&#146;s purposes are already clear. The Government consider that it is clear to anybody interested in it. We are not alone in this. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said on the final day in Committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802253000234"></a>&#147;the purpose of the Bill is made quite clear in  Clause 1&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/2/08; col. 908.]</ul>
<a name="80225-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0802253000168"></a>Something must have changed his mind since then. If someone asks what the Climate Change Act is, they will look at the Short Title, which will be the Climate Change Act, and then at the Long Title, which clearly sets out that the Bill is to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0802253000221"></a>&#147;Set a target for the year 2050 for the reduction of targeted greenhouse gas emissions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000169"></a>They will look at Clause 1(1), which sets out the duty to reduce the net UK carbon account by at least 60 per cent by 2050. If that does not make the purpose of the Bill perfectly clear, they can look at the debates in this House and the other place to understand the intention behind the words. That is another reason that a specific clause is unnecessary: the Bill&#146;s purpose is already clear.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0802253000170"></a>Thirdly, the Government believe that this proposed purpose clause could do more harm than good by confusing the message in the Bill. The problems, as have been outlined by more than one noble Lord in this debate, stem from the reference to a two degree rise in global temperatures. The first difficulty is that having any measure based on the global temperature would mean that we are dependent on what happens elsewhere in the world, and it is a principle of our legislation that we cannot legislate on an extra-territorial basis. We cannot tell other countries what to do through  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_456"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>domestic legislation. We can show them what we are doing, but we cannot make them do the same. Likewise, other countries cannot tell us what to do through their legislation. There is a real problem with setting out a purpose that is entirely dependent on what other people are doing. What does,</p>
<ul><a name="0802253000235"></a>&#147;the level necessary to contribute&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000205"></a>to global temperatures mean? It would depend entirely on the actions of others, which we cannot control. This means that the purpose would have a different meaning as time goes by depending on what the rest of the world is doing, so it could obscure what we believe is the Bill&#146;s already clear purpose.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0802253000171"></a>The Government consider that that in itself is a good reason for not making any reference to global temperatures, but there is a further problem with the reference to two degrees centigrade. The science on climate change tells us that there are major uncertainties in attempting to draw a direct line of causation between our actions in the UK and the rise in average temperatures across the world. That is why such bodies as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change use a range of probabilities to reflect the current level of scientific understanding. One has only to look at the panel&#146;s reports and those of others to see that while this is a big issue&#151;something is happening to the climate and the reasons are partly man made&#151;there is an enormous amount of uncertainty.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0802253000172"></a>The science tells us that we are talking about degrees of risk. Even if emissions around the world were to peak in the next decade and then decline to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050, there is still a 60 to 70 per cent chance of exceeding the two degree goal. The UK represents only 2 per cent of global emissions, so even if we stopped all UK emissions tomorrow, the overall likelihood of reaching the two degree global goal would be barely affected. Instead, we need a comprehensive, ambitious, globally agreed framework to tackle climate change, and the UK is working hard to achieve it. We had a good outcome from the Bali talks last year and we are working towards an agreement on the post-2012 framework at Copenhagen next year. This is also a vital part of the UK&#146;s contribution to avoiding dangerous climate change, but it is not mentioned in the proposed purpose of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0802253000173"></a>In moving the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that judges would not test each decision against the two degree purpose. Actually, they would. Subsection (2) of the amendment states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0802253000222"></a>&#147;The functions under this act must be exercised with the objective of achieving the principal aim of this Act&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000206"></a>Courts would be duty bound to look at any decision to see whether that had been done. I do not know what legal advice the noble Lord has taken, but the judges would take that into account if anyone wanted to pursue a judicial review at some point.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0802253000174"></a>As we discussed in Committee and as the Prime Minister announced in October, one of the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s first tasks will be to review the level of the 2050 target, and the Secretary of State has the power to amend that target in the light of the committee&#146;s review. Some Members of the House may be concerned that the reasons behind a change in the target will not be clear and that the  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_457"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>purpose of any change might get lost in the paper trail. I have tabled an amendment which I believe will address that, and we will come on to it shortly. My amendment would place a duty on the Committee on Climate Change to publish its advice and the reasons for it. The Secretary of State would obviously either agree or disagree with it, and if he disagreed and set the 2050 target at a different level, he would need to explain his reasons.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0802253000175"></a>Moreover, as I have said before but can say again today with more certainty, we are putting together a committee and asking it to do a job; we are not seeking to second-guess it. It was much more difficult to say that with any force when we did not know who would serve on the committee. Now we know who the chair is, and since last Friday we know who the first five members are. The quality of those who have been appointed is clear. I simply ask, therefore, that the House does not pre-judge the committee, bearing  in mind that it is known that one of the first things the committee will be asked to consider is the 60 per cent target.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0802253000176"></a>I do not criticise noble Lords for tabling the amendment but it is an incredibly clever way of trying to have your cake and eat it&#151;in effect, to try to stick it into the  80 per cent. We have a good case for leaving it at 60 per cent and leaving it to the Committee on Climate Change, and that is what we should do. To accept the amendment would tie everyone&#146;s hands; it would be as though the decision had already been made.</p>

<a name="80225-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0802253000177"></a>As well as many technical and legislative reasons for not doing so, there is a further reason. Now that we have appointed the Committee on Climate Change&#151;obviously in shadow form until Royal Assent&#151;it will be seen from the quality of its members that this matter is being taken extremely seriously. If your Lordships accept the Government&#146;s amendment, the effect would be to put the purpose of any 2050 target even further beyond doubt and explain the reason behind it to anyone who needs to know. The Explanatory Notes to the order making the amendment will have to refer to the statement of reasons, so it will be easily identifiable and there would have to be debates in your Lordships&#146; House and in another place. In other words, the amendment that I will bring forward will make quite clear the role of the Committee on Climate Change and the role of the Secretary of State in agreeing or disagreeing to its advice. It will not be able to be carried out behind close doors and become a fait accompli&#151;it will have to come back. So the issues will be fully aired and the debates and the statement will be more valuable than any purpose clause.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0802253000178"></a>As I said, for technical reasons, the way in which the new clause is drafted could do more harm than good. I am sure that is not the intention of the noble Lord in proposing it and I ask him to think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0802253000180"></a>I accept what the Minister said about a judicial review. Unfortunately, at that time I gave way to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and I may not have expressed exactly what I want to say. It would be a consideration under the terms of the amendment whether a particular decision or action had been taken with proper consideration and in a reasonable and rational way&#151;I accept that. Indeed, it would be a driver, I hope, to reinforce the need for the Committee on Climate Change and the Government to do that.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0802253000181"></a>I ask my noble friend Lord Blackwell and the noble Lords, Lord Jay, Lord Turnbull and Lord Woolmer, who all felt that the wording was infelicitous and not useful to the construction of the Bill, to read the amendment as printed. The objective is to play our part and ensure that we contribute to limiting the global average temperature increase to not more than two degrees. That is the essence of the Bill and, as far as I understand it, it is government policy. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, made the point earlier about the Prime Minister&#146;s comment.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0802253000182"></a>I understand that the phrase &#147;pre-industrial temperatures&#148; is rather abstract and vague. None of us was around at the time to know how warm or cold it was. However, it is the accepted wording in international protocols and the standard reference point for defining climate change. It is a widely accepted concept and I make no apology for using it. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0802253000190"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, Amendment No. 2 would change Clause 1(1). The provision states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0802253000224"></a>&#147;It is the duty of the Secretary of State to ensure that the net UK carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 60 per cent lower than the 1990 baseline&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000207"></a>With the amendment, it would state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="0802253000225"></a>&#147;It is the duty of the Secretary of State to promote policies and take measures, including the setting of targets and five year budgets, best calculated to ensure that the net UK carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 60 per cent lower than the 1990 baseline&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000191"></a>The use of the word &#147;promote&#148; is taken from Section 1 of the National Health Service Act 1946, and the words &#147;best calculated to&#148; come from the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0802253000192"></a>Unfortunately, I did not have the Marshalled List of amendments when I headed north to home in Scotland, and it was only when I saw the groupings at lunchtime that I saw that government Amendment No. 50 was grouped with this amendment. Had I known that earlier, I would have asked for the two to be separated, because the government amendment is actually nothing to do with this one. I have dropped a note to the Minister; I apologise for not letting him know earlier, but the information does not seem to percolate through to the north of Scotland. It could be said that this House is designed for those in the south of England rather than those in the north or indeed, in the case of the chairman of the Joint Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam&#151;I wish him a happy birthday&#151;on the west coast of Ireland.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0802253000193"></a>The amendment would give clear legislative expression to the underlying purpose of the Bill, setting out its principal objective, goals and conceptual basis. It is deliberately linked to Clause 4, which requires the preparation of budgets. The Joint Committee that I have just mentioned considered the question of enforceability at some length. Indeed, it was my noble friend Lord Crickhowell&#151;he sends his apologies to the House today&#151;who led the argument that to impose a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that a particular target should be achieved in 2050 was absurd and meaningless and that such a duty would never be enforced by the courts. The committee shared those doubts about enforceability. The issue was raised again during the debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech and again at Second Reading. My noble friend and I put down amendments in Committee to make Clause 1 a purpose clause that clearly set out the objective of the legislation, linked to Clause 4, imposing duties to achieve targets and five-year budgets, and underpinned by a clause establishing compliance mechanisms similar to those under the Kyoto Protocol and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0802253000194"></a>The object of those supporting the amendment is not to weaken the Bill but to strengthen it. It also fulfils the objective of clarity that the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_462"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Rooker, mentioned in respect of Amendment No. 1. Those who want the legislation to work are concerned that the whole exercise will be undermined when it comes to be understood that all the Government&#146;s words about leading the world by imposing a statutory obligation that is legally enforceable are really no more than spin. Other countries will certainly not be impressed, but they will perfectly understand a regime based on compliance mechanisms, with which they are familiar; we will come on to those in Amendments Nos. 22  and 81.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0802253000195"></a>It is interesting to look back and see how the Government&#146;s arguments have shifted like sand on  the question of enforceability. At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="0802253000226"></a>&#147;Putting a duty such as this into law is important in itself. It is not just about the punishment in the event of failure; it is about trying to change institutional behaviour through a change in the law ... By putting these duties into law, we are giving them a constitutional significance which will permeate down to every level of decision making&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/11/07; col. 1209.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000208"></a>In Committee, the Minister then made it clear that the clause was not drafted for the purpose of making it enforceable:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="0802253000227"></a>&#147;The intention was to attempt to change the infrastructure culture in Government ... We were trying to find a way to achieve behavioural change in Whitehall ... That is the central objective&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/12/07; col. 163.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000209"></a>There is the whole reason for this amendment.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0802253000196"></a>It seems extremely doubtful to me that civil servants will keep saying to themselves, &#147;I must not forget Clause 1, and my Ministers and I may be held responsible in 40 or more years&#146; time&#148;. It is much more likely that they will say, &#147;There&#146;s not a cat&#146;s chance in Hell that the courts will want to get involved in making judgments about these extremely complex issues and actions, which in many cases will be outside the control of the Secretary of State&#148;.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0802253000197"></a>Also at Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, raised the possibility of a court making a stringent order, such as one ordering the Government to purchase credits to remedy a position. He then moved significantly from the propositions made previously when he said in Committee:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="0802253000228"></a>&#147;We are saying that we do not accept using the law and judicial review as mechanisms to solve the problem. ... we have taken on board the representations, which have been made again today, that we need to look at the provisions in the Bill for compliance&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/12/07; col. 543.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80225-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0802253000198"></a>We then come to day three in Committee. The statement by the noble Lord, Lord Davies, that compliance mechanisms might be important was a big step forward, but in response to an amendment from my noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, produced what he described as &#147;an absolute gem&#148; from his brief, which established with devastating clarity&#151;far more than I am able to give your Lordships&#151;the very point that my noble friend Lord Crickhowell and I had been trying to make about the legal duty in Clause 1. The Minister said that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="0802253000229"></a>&#147;A legal duty to implement the proposals and policies would be highly unusual in legal terms. Ministers can say all they like about implementation, but a legal duty&#151;this is what my note says&#151;would be highly unusual in legal terms. On another point, the amendment would be very restrictive. If the Government were unable to implement one element of the plan&#151;through, say,  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_463"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unforeseen events&#151;they would be in breach of the law. The same problem would apply if evidence came forward supporting a change in policy approach. It is not intended&#151;this is not to demean the Bill at all&#151;that the programme should be drafted as a legal document. It is therefore likely that any duty to implement would raise questions about precisely what the duty is and what needs to be done in order to fulfil it, and it would be very difficult to determine whether the duty had actually been fulfilled. Legal duties need to be set out in a way that shows precision and inflexibility. We do not want the proposals ... to be drafted in this way. We want them to be understood and informative to the public&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/1/08; col. 778.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000210"></a>That is exactly the argument in our amendment. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Crickhowell stood up immediately and mentioned that to the Minister, but the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, fell back to his previous defence that the clause,</p>
<ul><a name="0802253000236"></a>&#147;was drafted so as to send a signal to the Civil Service; the noble Lord knows how the culture of Whitehall works. That is what Clause 1, line 1 is intended to do&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802253000211"></a>Then the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, produced another gem when he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802253000237"></a>&#147;a duty to implement a plan could be seen as a very broad enabling power for the Government to carry out any actions they proposed through the plan. I have no doubt the Delegated Powers Committee will have a look at that. I only say it &#147;could&#148; be seen to be a very broad enabling power. I do not think a power of that breadth would win the support of your Lordships&#146; House&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/01/08; col. 779.]</ul>
<a name="80225-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0802253000199"></a>The current situation is not satisfactory. We do not have a legally enforceable duty. The Joint Committee pointed that out, and its position has been reinforced. The wording that I propose tries to give that legal enforceability when combined with an amendment to Clause 4. I very much welcome the government amendment to Clause 4, although it does not go as far as my noble friend Lord Crickhowell and I wish to go, and we shall debate that. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_time2"></a><h5><a name="08022514000091"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="08022514000001"></a><b><a name="80225-0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08022514000302"></a>Lord Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, in the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, I support this amendment. I did not take any part in the lengthy proceedings in Committee and I do so now to make one short point only. I say at once that I do not like the drafting of Clause 1. In my view&#151;this was said by others in Committee&#151;it is meaningless to impose a duty on the Secretary of State that cannot be enforced. By way of contrast, many noble Lords present will remember the duty imposed on the Lord Chancellor under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, under which he is obliged to protect the independence of the judges. That duty is unobjectionable. If, for example, the Government were to attempt to oust judicial review&#151;as they did in one of the many Bills dealing with applications for asylum&#151;they could, on the face of it, be in breach of that duty and the question could then be tested by way of judicial review.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08022514000002"></a>Clause 1 of this Bill is quite different. It could not be said that the Secretary of State who happens to be in office in 2050 was in breach of the duty imposed by Clause 1 until the very last moment of 2050, by which time it would be far too late for anybody to do anything about it. In the mean time, there is nothing that anybody can do&#151;and certainly nothing on which the courts could possibly adjudicate. That applies to  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_464"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 464</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all Secretaries of State between now and then. So Clause 1 is what Roman law&#151;it is a very long time since I studied Roman law&#151;called lex imperfecta. It has no force and it has no place in this Bill.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08022514000003"></a>There could, of course, be no objection to stating a target figure in the Bill to give meaning to government Amendment No. 50, to which we shall come in due course. But to express it in the form of a duty is, as I say, meaningless and wrong. So whether we agree with Amendment No. 2 proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, or with Amendment No. 50, I hope that we shall get rid of Clause 1 as it stands.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08022514000004"></a>I have one other point. From what was said by the Minister in Committee, I gather that the real purpose of Clause 1 is, as the noble Earl observed, to give a wake-up call to the Civil Service. One could have no objection to that, but surely there must be other ways of achieving that desirable objective without putting something on the statute book the like of which I have never seen.</p>

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="08022514000005"></a><b><a name="80225-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022514000303"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment, which emphasises for me the fact that the Bill, much as it has broad political support from us all, does only three things: it sets targets, sets up an advisory committee and enables further legislation. That is all that it does and all that it pretends to do. It is good as far as it gets, but one of the most important things that we need to bring into the Bill is policy. Unless policies follow the Bill, we have no chance of meeting the targets. I like the fact that the amendment relates the duties of the Secretary of State to policies. That is why we support the amendment from these Benches. Government Amendment No. 50, which has been grouped with Amendment No. 2, is also a considerable improvement, because it does exactly the same thing and relates the legislation to proposals and policies. However, it still uses the language that we criticised in Committee, albeit without much support from the rest of the Committee. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08022514000083"></a>&#147;The proposals and policies must be prepared with a view to meeting&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022514000006"></a>We believe that they should be &#147;prepared to meet&#148;; I do not understand that language.</p>

Instead of imposing a duty to ensure that the nation reaches its target by 2050, it creates a separate objective and a duty to deliver everything that will make the objective possible. It is more sensible to attach the duty and accountability to the things that the Secretary of State does than to the way in which society responds to those things. The test becomes whether the Secretary of State, by action or omission, could be deemed to have behaved reasonably in relation to the objective in force. That could be in relation to the things that Secretaries of State do: they legislate, impose taxes and negotiate treaties, and they should be held responsible for those things.</p>

<a name="80225-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08022514000008"></a>The amendment&#146;s merit is that you would attach the duty to the things that Ministers did, such as authorising a suite of coal-fired power stations without a legal requirement that they should have carbon

The Conservative Benches have an in-house constitutional expert in the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. I found his criticisms of the clause and his evidence to the pre-legislative scrutiny committee compelling. That is why we need to look at this again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08022514000009"></a>As a former head of the Civil Service, I do not agree with the Minister&#146;s comments about the purpose being to make civil servants do something. Civil servants serve the Ministers of the day. Either that is binding on Ministers and civil servants or it is binding on neither. You cannot say that you are doing it to bind one and not the other. We should proceed along the lines put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness.</p>

We probably spent more time discussing this issue in the pre-legislative scrutiny committee than any other. The broad consensus moved from being sceptical to being supportive. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, has beautifully set it out. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is correct. What I like about this amendment is that it is crisp, sharp and precise. What I do not like about the government amendment is the phrase &#147;with a view to&#148;, which strikes me as bringing in an unnecessary ambiguity. I enthusiastically support this amendment.</p>

Not having been present for much of the Committee stage of the Bill, I am struck by the fact that those people who have been taking part and who have been putting a lot of energy into it have gone somewhat native on the subject. The Bill has become a sort of cause for itself in the way in which it will make these great changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08022514000012"></a>I was delighted that my noble friend won the first amendment. It seems to me that the public are looking for a reduction in temperature, because they all see the flowers coming out too soon and the potatoes shooting too soon and all the rest of it. They are very worried and they want the temperature reduced. They want this country to contribute to that. That is what the amendment says&#151;that this country should contribute to it, but not do the whole thing. Now we have the means by which that will happen, through the promotion of policies and measures, including the setting of targets and five-year budgets. That is simple and crisp, as we have just heard. It is interesting when someone in this House who knows more than most of us about how civil servants react to legislation tells us that anything as simple as this is helpful. I very much hope that we will accept the amendment.</p>

The voice is Jacob&#146;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. Today, the voice is the voice of Caithness but the words are the words of Crickhowell.</p>

I shall not rehearse what I said in Committee about the British Library Bill but, unlike my noble friend Lord Caithness, I find both my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 2 and the government Amendment No. 50 to be genuine and constructive responses to the debates that we had then and I could happily support both of them.</p>

As the Bill stands, there is a legal duty to ensure results. That is simply not within the power of the Secretary of State. Though we are in favour of placing the most stringent possible mandate on the Secretary of State and using the full power of the law to ensure that he does everything to achieve the targets, we understand that he has at his disposal only policies and programmes. However, mandating him to have policies that aim to reduce emissions and placing a duty for these to be sound policies by obliging him to submit them for approval to the Committee on Climate Change are enforceable and something that we would expect from the Secretary of State.</p>

Indeed, on this side of the House we welcome the Government&#146;s amendment, which requires the Secretary of State to draw up policies and proposals with the aim of meeting the budgets and targets. We are also grateful that the Government seem to have heeded the call that has long been coming from the Conservative Benches to have regard for sustainable development issues when such proposals are made. That is certainly to be welcomed. However, it in no way addresses the issue that my noble friend seeks to address. We want the Secretary of State&#146;s mandate to be realistic. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08022514000020"></a>The noble Earl talked about the difference between the duty to meet targets and the duty to implement plans or policies. They are quite different. The duty to meet a target&#151;a budget in this sense&#151;is fairly clear, because we can see whether it has been met from all the emissions statements. Theoretically, therefore, whether you have met your duty can be ruled on. A number would be there; it would have been achieved. The duty to implement policies is not so clear at all. You can get a policy document written in what looks like precise terms but which turn out to be vaguer in implementation. In legal terms, the duty to implement a policy is much less specific. There is a difference, as I hope is accepted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08022514000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, raised another issue. This place is full of ex-heads of the Civil Service, but I am served by its present head and my notes are no different from the notes that I had in Committee. The central plank of Clause 1 is to change behaviour in the Civil Service, not just in government. That is intended to send the signal around Whitehall&#151;I gave examples of ideas and submissions that come from Ministers and from the government machine&#151;that the duty in Clause 1 will be instrumental in changing or guiding behaviour in work across Whitehall. Another point is that this is not a Defra Bill; this is a government Bill covering all departments. I made that point in Committee, too. It is true that the Bill is about changing behaviour in the Civil Service and in government, but that does not mean that judicial review will not be possible. If we had no doubt that a budget would be missed, the court might make a declaration to that effect. Therefore, this approach does not close that off completely.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08022514000022"></a>We had a useful discussion in Committee about the importance of ensuring that Secretaries of State are bound by the requirement to meet the 2050 target. I said then that the duty to meet that target was fundamental to the Bill. The target is clear and quantified. It will encourage the action that is necessary for it to be met, and assessing compliance will be straightforward. Therefore, we would not want to accept an amendment that would replace the 2050 duty with what we believe is a weaker alternative. That is why we do not accept Amendment No. 2. Removing the duty to meet the 2050 target would in practice weaken the duty on the Secretary of State. By focusing on the process rather

I made that point in Committee and it is still valid.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08022514000023"></a>The proposed duty under Amendment No. 2 could result in a situation whereby the proposals and measures individually had the objective of ensuring that we reduced emissions in general terms but without addressing the need to reduce overall emissions by a specified amount. The Secretary of State could discharge the proposed duty by developing two or three policies and take a few measures with the genuine objective of reducing emissions by at least the current figure of  60 per cent, but if the measures turned out not be enough he would still have complied with his obligation. That cannot be right. Amendment No. 2 would weaken the Bill.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08022514000024"></a>The important rationale for the Bill is to provide greater certainty about the UK&#146;s direction of travel. Weakening the duty is not the best way to do this. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said when he raised these issues in Committee&#151;I agreed that we wanted to take account of them and to get this as clear and as accurate as we could&#151;we are keen to provide the strongest possible assurance that every Secretary of State between now and 2050, and beyond, will be under an equally strong duty.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08022514000025"></a>However, it would be a mistake to look at Clause 1(1) in isolation. The overall effect of the Bill&#146;s existing framework, as a whole, goes a long way towards relating short-term government actions to the long-term target. In particular, there is already a legal requirement that budgets from this year onwards must be set with a view to meeting the 2050 target and proposals and policies must be published to show how we plan to meet each budget. The Bill&#146;s annual reporting framework will ensure that the Committee on Climate Change and Parliament have a role in scrutinising performance every year. That is an important point, which I probably did not stress sufficiently in our first debate today.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08022514000026"></a>However, bearing in mind the debate that we had in Committee, we want to provide further reassurance on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. Government Amendment No. 50, which I shall move at the appropriate time, will therefore place an additional duty on the Secretary of State to bring forward proposals and policies that, in his view, are sufficient to meet the carbon budgets for the periods for which the budgets have been set. These policies and measures should be developed with a view to meeting the target for 2050 and any subsequent targets that may be set. To ensure that a UK-wide approach is taken, our amendment provides that in preparing the proposals and policies the Secretary of State may take into account the proposals and policies that he considers may be prepared by other national authorities. This is a better approach, which complements the duty to meet the 2050 target rather than replaces it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08022514000027"></a>There is strength of feeling on this issue and I understand why the noble Lord has tabled the amendment. We want to put our intentions beyond doubt in legislative terms. It goes without saying that climate change mitigation policies must not ride roughshod over the

In most of these cases, we would expect policies to seek win-win situations.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08022514000028"></a>It is true also that the broad existing principle is well established and embedded in government policy making&#151;I am thinking here of the sustainable development strategy, which was quoted back at me earlier. Given the sustainable development action plan published by government departments and the independent advisory advocacy and watchdog role relating to government operations that we have given to the Sustainable Development Commission, there is no need to make additional provisions in the Bill. We raised this argument in Committee, and government Amendment No. 50 meets the points that we made then. Amendment No. 2, however, would weaken the Bill. We can argue about the duty, whether it is supposed to send signals to the Civil Service, or whether that would be the appropriate mechanism, but the words in the amendment would weaken the Bill. That cannot be a sensible way forward.</p>

The score is 9:1&#151;almost familiar to a game of football against Scotland these days, sadly. Having listened to what has been said in the House about Clause 1 being incoherent, inoperable and having no force, I am convinced that what my noble friend Lord Crickhowell and I are trying to do is right. I acknowledge that government Amendment No. 50 makes a small response to our concerns, but we have to consider Clause 1(1). It is unenforceable; it is a spin on the actual situation, which does not set a good example. In view of the government amendment, it is right that I should come back with slightly revised wording to take it into account. I cannot do that now, but I give notice to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that his reply has not satisfied me. I do not think that it has satisfied the rest of the House; certainly, those of us on the Joint Committee are still not happy.

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08022514000033"></a>The issue of 60 or 80 per cent is important because that is our commitment. Many noble Lords have said that it makes no difference what we do, because a new power station coming on board each week in China will make our actions almost irrelevant. However, we have created an historical legacy of carbon in the atmosphere. People talk about pre-industrial levels, but it was inventors in this country who utilised the steam engine, and we have some responsibility for the vast amounts of coal that have been burned since then, which have added dramatically to the problem.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08022514000034"></a>We should not look at moving up to an 80 per cent level as a problem; it is an opportunity. If we are to move to a low-carbon economy, we must look at adapting all our technologies. If every country in the world were also honour-bound to meet those obligations, it would give us a position in the market place that would be extremely helpful. We need only look at the Danes taking on the wind turbine industry to see that we missed out significantly in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08022514000035"></a>The real issue behind this, as we discussed at Second Reading, is whether the decision to go to 80 per cent should be taken by the climate change committee or in Parliament. It is an important point that we cannot get away from. I took on board the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that the decision could be the first indication that the climate change committee had teeth. However, that is a real problem. We are talking in a legislative chamber about a target that looks very bland on a piece of paper&#151;this is an extremely short amendment&#151;but that will have massive implications for how everyone in this country lives their life, for how laws are formed and for how local authorities set their own targets for meeting this objective. It will have implications, both financial and personal, for many people and businesses throughout the country. Turning it over to a committee is a major problem. The committee is a worthy organisation, but does it undermine the political push behind the 80 per cent target if that target comes from the committee? The target might well be based on science, but we should not fool ourselves. It will take an enormous amount of political will power to meet this target, and for that to happen, it must be set by the Government.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08022514000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, and, if I can say this on his birthday, the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said that this could be the first decision that the committee took; indeed, I hope that it will be the committee&#146;s first decision if it does not get passed to Parliament. However, there is still a fundamental problem with passing the decision to a committee. It really must be taken in this House. When speaking to an earlier amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that he was not going to second-guess the committee. I do not think that we should second-guess the committee; the committee should be given firm and direct guidelines that 80 per cent is the target that we believe will be met. The target is based on science and is the one about which most international observers are now talking. If we are not prepared to stick it in legislation in what is a very brave Bill, as has been noted, that undermines the entire case and the strength of the committee. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

However, we do not think that this is the best way of gaining such a commitment. We certainly agree that the 60 per cent target is outdated. As we have noted in the House many times, that target is based on eight year-old science, and it is almost certainly not the right ultimate goal. However, we do not feel that parliamentarians should set the targets, which should be scientifically based. This is why we have tabled an amendment that would place a duty on the Committee on Climate Change to set the targets. That has been part of our position on this side of the House from the outset: science, not politics, should be the driving force behind the targets for carbon emissions.</p>

<a name="80225-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08022514000038"></a>Last November, the Prime Minister said that the  60 per cent target seemed insufficient and that, in all likelihood, the overall target would be increased. We on this side of the House hope that any change in the target will be a reflection of the scientific deliberation of the Committee on Climate Change and not the result of a ministerial proclamation or even of an amendment voted on in this House. Thus, although we recognise the importance of having robust targets, we continue to insist that they must also be authoritative. Therefore, although we understand the spirit of the amendment, we cannot support it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08022514000040"></a>The amendment is inappropriate because this is the golden opportunity for the climate change committee to establish itself. Furthermore, it will not have escaped your Lordships&#146; notice that this Bill, which affects every person in this country, is going through this House untouched and unnoticed by the media, which I find extraordinary. It is my sincere hope that, when the Committee on Climate Change comes up with the science to require that the target be moved to 80 per cent, it will be a sufficient wake-up call for the media. I hope that national newspaper headlines will cover it and that the media will realise the situation that the nation faces. For that reason, almost more than any other, I should like to leave this to the Committee on Climate Change, which will unquestionably make a lot of noise when it makes this decision&#151;and I hope that it does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08022514000042"></a>It is clear that 60 per cent is now widely seen as being too low a figure; the Prime Minister, a large number of scientists and some UN bodies have said that. My noble friend Lord Stern has said it, and he repeated it in a newspaper article a couple of days ago. Therefore, against all that background, if the Bill says 60 per cent, it will look and will be weak, which will destroy its credibility nationally and internationally.</p>

There is a risk that, if the committee is asked to do something with a nudge and a wink from the Government that 80 per cent is the right answer, that may weaken rather than strengthen it. I would strongly argue that we should put 80 per cent in the Bill and that the committee should focus on other targets and on means of implementing that 80 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08022514000046"></a>One piece of evidence to emerge from that conference was from the polling of 18 to 34 year-olds, which had indicated that they had no intention of reducing the amount of flying that they did, compared to that done by their elders and betters, and, therefore, were not initially instantly going to modify their behaviour. A briefing sent by the British Youth Council to all Members of your Lordships&#146; House in advance of Second Reading, which it reinforced thereafter, said that the target figure should be 80 per cent. That indicates a discrepancy. I acknowledge that the British Youth Council goes up only to the age of 24 and that its members are younger than the 18 to 34 year-old group, but there is a discrepancy in attitude to behaviour and attitude to aspirational targets. We are more likely to achieve our ultimate objective if we seek to change behaviour and to demonstrate it during the evolution of this policy, rather than if we put it in the Bill now and do not wait for the Committee on Climate Change to give us its advice. In those circumstances, I hope that the willingness of the nation to adjust its behaviour will be more likely to occur.</p>

With all due respect to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, putting 80 per cent in the Bill, whether in this or another place, is not sufficient to explain meaningfully the changes in the way people will have to live. I will give some financial examples in a moment. The Committee on Climate Change will probably be much better placed than this House to explain the reasons for decisions. This is the same amendment that we had earlier; the arguments are the same, save that we now have the membership of the climate change committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08022514000048"></a>The level of the 2050 target will have implications for all sectors of the economy and at all levels of society. We have probably not spelt those out sufficiently here. The Stern report went some way towards doing it, but the Committee on Climate Change will be able to do a lot more on that. It is therefore imperative that work considering the level at which the target should be set considers a wide range of issues. The terms of reference by which the committee will conduct this review demonstrate the breadth of the issues that will be considered. Moving to another number, namely 80, ahead of the review, on the basis of a limited analysis, would not be appropriate. We are setting up the Committee on Climate Change to do this job, which is why we have tabled government Amendment No. 121, which we will come to later. This will probably be a theme of Report stage. Amendment No. 121 will place the review by the Committee on Climate Change on a statutory footing and set clear, legally binding deadlines, by which this review must be reported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08022514000049"></a>Placing the committee&#146;s review in statute, as our amendment proposes, sends a strong signal that, while the Government understand that a reduction of 60 per cent may no longer be a sufficient level of effort for developed-world countries, it is absolutely essential that we base decisions on the level of the 2050 target on the best possible independent, and most up-to-date, advice. The terms of reference set out exactly what the committee will be expected to consider: all the relevant evidence to provide a thorough analytical study of the level of the 2050 target. We cannot do this in debates in this House or the other place. Until the expert committee has carried out its review, it would be premature to change that target to 80 per cent or, indeed, any other number.</p>

This is only an initial analysis. These are exactly the kind of questions that the Committee on Climate Change will need to look at. It demonstrates the seriousness of the issue. Someone has to explain that you must change the way you live and work. It is much better that this should come from the advice of the Committee on Climate Change to Government, and then through Parliament, than from us simply putting in another number because the message is that at least 60 per cent is not sufficient and we ought to do the

I was interested in how the Minister set out the way that the committee is going to have explain climate change&#151;as if the Committee on Climate Change will be the only body in the country doing that. The committee will be an important body, but it will not be the only one. In fact, vast numbers of other bodies have talked about climate change. The Stern review examined it, we have the UN panels, and of course all the scientific evidence is looking at 80 per cent.</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08022514000054"></a>I like government Amendment No. 121 because I think it will achieve one of the objectives. However, it is almost a bit much for the Minister to say that while the Government will base the level on the science, Amendment No. 121 will make sure that the climate committee comes up with the figure straightaway, so everything will be all right. We are a scrutinising Chamber. To say that it is quite acceptable to go for a figure we know is going to be changed is in fact unacceptable. On that basis, those noble Lords who care about the scrutiny of this legislation and do not want it to be weak in any way should not see this as a political manoeuvre&#151;there are no politics in this because all sides of the House are looking at the science&#151;because there is nothing to be gained from specifying either 60 or 80 per cent. But I believe that this should be on the face of the Bill and on that basis, I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08022514000059"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment  No. 4 is grouped with a series of government amendments. Our amendment seeks to place a duty on the Committee on Climate Change to propose a new 2050 target within six months. This is a straightforward transfer of responsibility from the political to the scientific. The proposal would still be subject to approval by Parliament and thus there is no concern about a democratic deficit or about handing too much power over to bodies outside Parliament. It simply places the recommending power where it should be with those who know how to do it.</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08022514000060"></a>The Government have obviously noticed that there is a problem with this aspect of the Bill. There needs to be a larger role for the committee in regard to scientific issues. However, in our view, the Government&#146;s amendments do not go far enough and still leave the ultimate decision regarding the target in the hands of the Secretary of State. Their amendments place a duty on the committee to advise the Secretary of State. In our view, this is too weak. Under the Government&#146;s scheme, the Committee on Climate Change will give  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_477"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 477</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its advice on the new targets and publish it. The Secretary of State will then lay a resolution before Parliament to change the target percentages or, if he chooses, he can foolishly ignore the advice entirely. The Government&#146;s amendments rely on the Secretary of State not being so foolish as to ignore the advice. While I hope he would not, there still seems to be scope for him to do so.</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08022514000061"></a>Much of the Bill deals with setting out the framework for policies. Our amendments are part of an attempt to beef-up the role of the committee. I have asked that some of these policies and orders be subject to the committee&#146;s scrutiny. We have no interest in cutting out the Government and replacing them with an all-party, oligarchic committee. Ministers get advice from all kinds of committees and departments, much of which is published. At the end of the day, the public perception is that these are ministerial decisions. We want to avoid this perception. By placing the burden of target setting on the committee we ensure that the 2050 target is not only genuinely authoritative but that it appears to be so. A Minister agreeing with the committee&#146;s advice and proposing precisely what it recommends does not possess the same degree of authority.</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08022514000062"></a>In practice, all of this might not matter tremendously under the Government&#146;s amendments. We appreciate the Government heeding the advice of the House on the need for an increased role for the committee. Their amendments are a step in the right direction. With their amendments, ideally the Minister will follow exactly the published advice of the committee; our target will be more robust and, more importantly, scientifically validated. If this is what the Government truly have in mind, it seems strange that they were not willing to go that extra mile, be a little more courageous and pass the job of setting the targets more fully into the hands of the committee. I beg to move.</p>

Although I like my noble friend&#146;s amendment, I am quite attracted by the Government&#146;s amendment. My noble friend&#146;s amendment seeks to place a duty on the committee to recommend to the Secretary of State within six months of its constitution, whereas the Government&#146;s amendments seem to establish a rolling programme for the committee to advise the Secretary of State and there may well be further changes in due course. If my noble friend&#146;s amendment was amended to be a rolling one, I would give it my wholehearted support.</p>

On the whole, we on these Benches prefer the Government&#146;s amendments in terms of the balance between the committee, the Government and Parliament. We believe that ultimately it is up to the Government to put proposals to Parliament. We hope that the advice of the Committee on Climate Change will seldom be changed or ignored; that is why the publication requirements we shall come on to later are so important. We certainly support the Government&#146;s amendments in this area.</p>

Earlier in our debates, the Minister clearly identified that the committee would have an important role once it was up and running and that it should not only be up to the Government to sell the Bill to members of the public, whose support we need to gain for it to work effectively. In reflecting upon my noble friend&#146;s amendment, does the Minister accept that it seeks to put a duty on the committee within six months&#151;it could be sooner but obviously within a six month period&#151;to set a new target and recommend it to the Government?</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08022514000066"></a>It is difficult having the government amendments within this group because the Minister will not speak to them until we have sat down, and we cannot come back to him in the same way that we can in Committee. I would be grateful if the Minister would tell us more about his amendment at this stage and how he sees the difference between my noble friend&#146;s amendments and the government amendments. If it is left until we come to, let us say, Amendment No. 121, in its proper slot at Report stage, my understanding from past experience is that the Minister will move it formally and we will not debate it. If history has moved on since I took my last Bill through and I am wrong, I will not be so anxious. However, I am anxious that we should have a chance to debate the Minister&#146;s amendments within this grouping before we find ourselves in a position where we cannot question the Minister directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08022514000067"></a>At this stage, I would like to place on record my support for my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 4, and I shall listen with interest to hear what the Minister has to say about his amendments in this group.</p>

As he is moving Amendment No. 4, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, will have the last word on this debate anyway. I will speak to that amendment. Basically, we do not like it, because it cuts the Government out completely. We did not use these words, but, to be honest, it is doing exactly what we said we were opposed to: giving the climate change committee an executive function. That is, root and branch, what we are opposed to; it should have an advisory function. We are sympathetic to the aims of the amendment, as indicated by the group of amendments we have tabled. If I may be a bit nitpicky, Amendment No. 4 does not address the consequential issues of carrying out the review, which the government amendments do&#151;but then I have probably got a bigger team than the Opposition. The central issue, however, is that the amendment would cut the Government out.</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08022514000069"></a>I will explain the Government&#146;s amendments in some detail. As I indicated earlier in the debate on the 2050 target, we have tabled amendments that will place a review of the 2050 target by the Committee on Climate Change on a statutory footing. That will improve the transparency of the process, and I understand that it will be welcomed as evidence that we have delivered on what we promised in this respect.  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_479"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08022514000070"></a>The Prime Minister announced that the committee&#146;s review of the 2050 target should consider whether it should be tightened up to 80 per cent. We have committed to ensure that the review will take place as soon as possible, and the committee should report at the same time as it produces its advice on the level of the first three budgets. Government Amendment No. 121 delivers on both those promises, and actually goes significantly further by making the review statutory&#151;that is, a legally binding obligation. </p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08022514000071"></a>Last week, we published the terms of reference for the review, which add further transparency to the whole process by showing exactly what we want the committee to consider. The terms of reference make clear that the climate change committee will consider important associated issues including the impact on the 2020 target, whether the target should be extended to cover all greenhouse gases and the implications of including international aviation and international shipping emissions. We debated all those issues at various stages in Committee. I hope, therefore, that this shows we were in listening mode, in that we specifically want the climate change committee to look at these issues. That will allow us to take decisions on the level of the 2050 target, based on the best possible independent advice. As I have said, we do not consider it appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the review by putting the different target in the Bill now, as proposed in Amendment No. 3.</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08022514000072"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 19, 151, 164, 172 and 173. As I mentioned, the other amendments in this group address the consequential issues relating to the timing of the committee&#146;s first budget advice, its first progress report and the government response, and the guidance and directions clauses of the Bill. Following discussion with the shadow Committee on Climate Change&#151;because there has been a shadow secretariat there for some time&#151;we believe that December 2008 is a realistic timetable for the committee to complete its review of the 2050 target. That has a number of knock-on effects. It makes sense for the committee to give its advice on the first three budgets at the same time as its advice on the 2050 target, so Amendment No. 151 delays the committee&#146;s advice on budgets for three months; that is, from September this year to December this year. It is a three-month extension to the deadline in the Bill as currently drafted. We do not consider that to be an inappropriate delay, and it will give the committee enough time to complete its work.</p>

<a name="80225-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08022514000073"></a>As the committee&#146;s advice on the first budgets will be three months later, government Amendment  No. 19 also extends the deadline by which the Government must set the first three budgets by the same length of time, to 1 June 2009. That ensures that the Government have as much time as previously proposed&#151;that is, six months&#151;to consider the committee&#146;s advice, consult the devolved Administrations and set the carbon budgets. Because the Government will not set the first budgets until June 2009, it makes no sense to ask the Committee on Climate Change to produce its first progress report in the same month. Government Amendment No. 164 extends the deadline for the committee&#146;s progress report, and Amendments Nos. 172 and 173 extend the deadline for the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08022514000074"></a>I assure your Lordships that those proposals are there purely to reflect the proposed timing of the 2050 review, and would apply only to the first progress report and the first government response. Every future progress report by the committee and response by the Government would need to be published to the deadlines set out in Clauses 28 and 29 in the Bill as drafted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08022514000075"></a>Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 are consequential amendments that simply make specific provision for any guidance and directions relating to the 2050 review to be given by the Secretary of State alone following consultation with the devolved Administrations.

In the main, one would assume that we would follow the advice, but there may be occasions when we do not. My noble friend is right.</p>

He talks about the best possible advice. The assumption I had made was that the best possible advice would be the advice given by the climate change committee.

As we know from the rest of the Bill, there can be sub-committees of other people. That is what I meant by &#147;the best possible advice&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08022514000081"></a>I meant to say to my noble friend that the best possible advice is not the hunch of a Minister, or the hunch of a pressure group or some lobby group&#151;it is the transparent advice from of the climate change committee. If that is not accepted, the procedures in the Bill are such that Ministers will have to be up-front at the Dispatch Box and very clear about why they are not accepting it. The default position is that the climate change committee&#146;s advice will be accepted, and, if it is not, Ministers will have to explain to Parliament why not.</p>

There may be cases where the Government do not accept the advice and have to come to Parliament to get approval for something else. However, the advice of the Committee on Climate Change will be open and transparent for all to see. The committee would have a view&#151;quite a serious view&#151;if the Government decided not to accept its advice. My noble friend uses the word &#147;drift&#148;. I do not think this is drift at all&#151;this is what normally happens. This is an advisory climate change committee, which will give independent advice to Government and, through Government, to Parliament, because it will be published and transparent. It is not an executive committee. It is not making the decision, The implication of what my noble friend is saying is that it should make the decision and there should be no choice whether Government accept it or not. Our view has always been that the Government should make the decisions and be accountable for them to Parliament.</p>

I have been heartened by the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, because they reinforce our view that the key to getting this right lies in that balance between Parliament on the one hand and the climate change committee and the Government on the other. We have that other great body, public opinion, on the outside. To some degree, the Minister has called on that fourth force in suggesting that no Minister is going to publicly override a recommendation from the climate change committee because it would be so electorally difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08022520000007"></a>This is an interesting debate to which we may well have to return at Third Reading, because it involves matters of principle. I recognise the strength of the Minister&#146;s commitment to increasing the role of the climate change committee while reserving the authority of the Secretary of State&#151;I think that summarises his position. We are also pleased that the arguments that we presented in Committee have manifested themselves in a series of Government amendments.

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08022520000012"></a>The noble Earl said: In Clause 2, the Secretary of State may by order change the 2050 target and change the 1990 baseline. While I am sure that a Secretary of State would not make these important changes out of political expediency, we want to ensure that they are made with the blessing and recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change. Our amendments are designed to ensure that the committee is playing a central role in terms of the overall scientific framework&#151;that is, the targets in the baseline year. Orders to amend these shall not be made unless there is approval of the committee. In that respect these amendments are very straightforward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08022520000013"></a>I concede that Clause 2(2) says that changes can only be made if it appears to the Secretary of State that there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change. The Minister talked about &#147;best possible advice&#148; in the debate on the previous amendment, which of course means the Committee on Climate Change, and I am rather hoping that when he responds to this he will come up with the same thing. When there is a reference to scientific

<a name="80225-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08022520000014"></a>We do not want to allow the Secretary of State the leeway of ignoring the Committee&#146;s advice, or indeed not seeking its advice at all, on these very important issues. We do not see these amendments as taking away powers from the Government. We simply feel that how much carbon emissions need to be reduced, by when, and how that is to be counted, are wholly scientific matters. Of course, how the Government go about doing so is up to them. We will come to the committee&#146;s role in this later on.</p>

<a name="80225-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08022520000015"></a>As my noble friend Lord Taylor said, we want a balance between the roles of the committee, the Parliament and the Government. We called it a triangular relationship in Committee. The amendments seek to ensure that the appropriate emphasis is placed on the appropriate side of the triangle and that these scientific matters need to be considered by the committee. I appreciate that the Government do not intend to build a situation in which they can ignore the committee. We are just trying to guarantee that this does not happen. I beg to move.</p>

If one simply takes the effects of Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, the Government would have to follow the committee&#146;s recommendations and the only alternative is not to act at all. If either House of Parliament rejected the committee&#146;s recommendations there would be complete stalemate and nothing could be changed. It may be triangular to the noble Lord, but it is giving the committee executive functions.</p>

<a name="80225-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08022520000017"></a>We want the committee to give advice and the Government to be accountable to Parliament. This is the very last point my noble friend was asking me about. I agreed with him that it Parliament would take the decision and not Ministers, because Ministers would have to come to Parliament in any event. Therefore, we had these discussions at some length in Committee. We want to ensure that we design a system that has some element of democratic accountability. The proposals put forward in this group of amendments would mean that the Committee on Climate Change would essentially be responsible for taking the decisions. As I have said, decisions about how we reduce carbon emissions will have far-reaching consequences which, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, will require brave actions. It is only right these are made by an elected body. Delegating such decisions to the unelected committee undermines democratic accountability.</p>

<a name="80225-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08022520000018"></a>The committee&#146;s role is to provide the best possible advice on the level of budgets and to hold the Government and the country accountable for progress towards them. The Government&#146;s view is that the committee should not have a role in choosing the policy mechanisms most appropriate to meet the budgets. The climate change committee will be incredibly influential. In this respect, it will be much more powerful than some advisory committees. I hope that good heart has been taken from the members who have been appointed to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08022520000019"></a>I cannot accept the amendments but I promised in Committee to consider how we can ensure that the committee&#146;s advice is given full prominence and that the Government&#146;s response is fully transparent. In particular, it needs to be clear where our views diverge, if and when that happens. We will debate the Government amendments separately. We are proposing that the Government should be required to seek and take account of advice from the committee in three additional situations. We are tabling amendments to propose that the Secretary of State should be required to explain if he disagrees with the committee&#146;s advice on targets, greenhouse gases and budgets, and we will come to those at the appropriate time. But that is largely why we cannot accept this group of amendments. They fall into the same trap as the previous amendment.</p>

I ask noble Lords to consider for a moment what happened with the establishment of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. I remember being advised as a humble Labour Back-Bencher at the time that we could not trust the politicians and that we needed an independent body to take a major decision affecting management of the economy, whereby prior to elections we would not put interest rates down and after them we would not put interest rates up. It was as simple as that; that is how it was presented. I accepted it on that basis and I think that my noble friend probably accepted it similarly on that basis. I cannot see the difference here. The policy of raising interest rates after elections and putting them down before is the policy of drift, and it does not work. The Labour Government&#146;s greatest success in all these years has been to take that one decision which removed from us that responsibility. It did not provide for drift. This is another amendment which is trying to tie us down and tie us in to a decision taken by the committee; whereas, alternatively, some of us believe that drift is inevitable.</p>

<a name="80225-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08022520000021"></a>I remember some weeks ago when my noble friend stood there and told us that, one day, he would return to the Back Benches. I have a vision of him standing on the Back Benches in a number of years&#146; time hectoring and belabouring the then Government&#151;not necessarily a Labour Government&#151;over the fact that they have allowed drift to interfere with the committee's decisions and that we will not meet targets because they have allowed electoral considerations to interfere when the real decisions have to be taken.</p>

I think that he has misread the analogy with the Bank of England. The true analogy is that the Government take the fundamental political decision on whether we are a high-inflation or low-inflation economy and on the degree of rigour. The Government set the target and then assign the task of delivering that target to an operational body. The analogy is not the same in this case. What is being proposed is that the target should be set by the committee. That is a completely different constitutional position. The position set out by the Minister is therefore right. The target is set on advice

I think that the evidence of the Bank of England actually leads one to exactly the opposite conclusion.</p>

We may therefore rehearse them again. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, says, it is not an exact analogy at all. Far from a tripartite arrangement, it is not at all clear&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said&#151;what role the Government would serve here other than as a post box. The opposition Front-Bench proposals throughout the Bill effectively involve the climate change committee taking decisions about a whole range of things. If it made a recommendation on the emissions from energy generation of a particular scale and rigour and those could effectively be met only by nuclear generation on a large scale&#151;and that is not impossible&#151;it would mean that the Government of the day, even if opposed to it, would have to accept the target knowing that the means of achieving it was something to which they were diametrically opposed. That seems&#151;although I would personally be in favour of such a policy&#151;nonsense.</p>

<a name="80225-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08022520000024"></a>The climate change committee will make proposals based on judgments it has reached through its scientific and rigorous assessment, and those proposals will have implications. The Government of the day will have to face the question of what they will recommend to Parliament, and they may have to take a different view. That is the role of government. The Government of the day have to weigh up a whole range of complex issues as well as the expert scientific advice. I cannot imagine a situation where any Government would want to be bound in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08022520000025"></a>I finish with the following conundrum. If Parliament rejected what the climate change committee recommended, who would negotiate with the committee to change the situation? Would it be the Government, who are a post box for a disagreeing Parliament? With which House of Parliament or party would it negotiate? It is the politics of the madhouse. The Government of the day ultimately have the responsibility of proposing to Parliament. That is their political responsibility. They will agree or disagree. But if Parliament rejects the proposal, it is then clearly the Government's duty to negotiate with the climate change committee. If the Government are simply a post box, the Secretary of State will be in a totally invidious position. He would have no locus or authority. The climate change committee would say, &#147;It&#146;s no good negotiating with you because Parliament has rejected it&#148;.</p>

In that debate I said that the Government might well believe that their ability to calculate the process of change was inherent anyway. If change making is not going to be in the experience which is looked for in the Committee on Climate Change, and will therefore be supplied by the Government, then I can totally see why the Government would wish to retain the possibility. But they will obviously have to defend any occasion when they are at variance with recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change. I therefore find the Minister's observations convincing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08022520000034"></a>I also said in Committee that the idea of a compatibility test would have a limited practical effect, and that it would be difficult if not impossible ever to demonstrate that a single act of legislation was, on its own, incompatible with the aims of the Bill. Even if particular legislation would lead to an increase in emissions, that would not in itself be incompatible with the 2050 target, as there would be nothing to stop compensatory action being taken in another area to reduce emissions. In practice, then, we could honestly say that every piece of legislation was, if looked at in isolation, compatible with the aims of the Bill. This has been looked at very carefully, and therefore the amendment would achieve nothing at all.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08022520000035"></a>As I said in Committee, we agree that an important point&#151;about making sure that we take account of the full range of government policies&#151;underlies the amendment. As I emphasised earlier, this is across the Government and not just Defra. The full range includes those that might put up emissions as well as those that might bring them down. As I said in my letter covering the Government&#146;s amendments, there are already robust processes in place within government to ensure that the carbon impacts of policies are assessed at every stage of their development process. That is important as legislation is often made toward the end of policy development, so a test applied only at that stage would not, in itself, achieve much.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08022520000036"></a>We have looked further since being in Committee. I can assure the House that the Government are committed to amending the guidance on Explanatory Notes that accompany primary legislation. That change will require the section of the Explanatory Notes covering the impact assessment to refer specifically to the more detailed carbon impact assessment carried out for that legislation. By explicitly detailing each policy&#146;s carbon impact in the overall cost-benefit analysis and, where applicable, the package of parliamentary documents, we should be able to signal the carbon impact of the policy to as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08022520000037"></a>I hope that the new change to the Explanatory Notes, which has come about following our debates in Committee, provides sufficient reassurance about the robustness of the existing mechanism to assess the carbon impacts of policies&#151;not just legislation&#151;so I am grateful to noble Lords for bringing this up. I hope that with the spirit having been there in Committee, as I indicated then, bringing this about in practice with such a change to the Explanatory Notes will go some way to showing that we have, first, listened and, secondly, done something practical about it.</p>

I have been enormously impressed and persuaded by my noble friend Lord Rooker on this issue. Although he gave no undertaking in Committee, I think that he was sympathetic to what I was proposing. He said that the committee,</p>
<ul><a name="08022520000125"></a>&#147;is an advisory committee ... but I remember that when ACAS was set up it was not called ACAS&#151;I was on the Standing Committee in the other place&#151;and the &#147;A&#148; was added during the course of the legislation. The suggestion made by my noble friend is welcome, but I cannot comment on it today&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/1/08; col. 1070.]</ul>
<p><a name="08022520000107"></a>I made inquiries earlier, on this occasion, and I understand that my noble friend is likely to say that the advisory committee has wider functions and cannot be confined simply to being an advisory committee. Yet, if I may remind him of it, ACAS also has wider considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08022520000043"></a>While I am not prepared to go to the wall on this issue at present, the Government should think again about it for the reasons given in Committee. I stress, then, that the word &#147;advisory&#148; is all-important. I beg to move.</p>

We sought to clarify in Committee, as I want to now, the nature of the Committee on Climate Change. My noble friend suggests that its having the word &#147;advisory&#148; in front might assist. My noble friend Lord Rooker indicated in Committee that he would certainly look at this but, as he put it, he liked the ring of &#147;Committee on Climate Change&#148; and the element of authority and importance which that represented.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08022520000045"></a>We are wary about changing the name of the committee when we have the opportunity to spell out its exact role and how it will work. I recognise that my noble friend&#146;s amendment is relatively minor, as when, in that earlier debate, we debated whether it should be called a &#147;Commission&#148; rather than a &#147;Committee&#148;. The only reason for changing the name of the body, in our view, is if there is a difference in view about what sort of body it should be.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08022520000046"></a>We have had several opportunities this afternoon to clarify these issues, and we are quite clear about the nature of that committee. It will be an advisory, non-departmental public body by classification and, as my noble friend Lord Rooker has already emphasised, it would not be appropriate to give it executive functions. That was the burden of debate earlier today and in

However, the committee will be an extremely influential organisation and, in that respect, a much more powerful body than some other advisory committees. In terms of influence, it may be compared to the Monetary Policy Committee, although it does not have the same executive powers. We are talking about an extremely influential body, by whose membership we have also shown how influential we intend it to be.</p>

I take his point. However, as we shall discuss later, we are tabling amendments further to strengthen the role of this committee. In particular, we are proposing that the Government should be required to seek and take account of advice from the committee in three additional situations of great import in relation to international aviation or international shipping emissions, greenhouse gas emissions other than carbon dioxide and carbon accounting. We are also tabling amendments to increase the transparency of the relationship between the committee, government and Parliament, which was the burden of the debate we had a few moments ago.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08022520000049"></a>In addition to strengthening the committee&#146;s responsibility, we have taken steps to ensure that it is distinct and has significantly more autonomy and influence than a very large number of advisory committees. For this reason, the Committee on Climate Change is unusual in having powers to enter into contracts of its choosing and to appoint its own staff. I recognise that my noble friend is seeking to be helpful in an area where we are engaged in important debate. His intention is obvious enough; he accepts the Government&#146;s position as regards the advisory nature of the committee. As far as the Government are concerned, the Committee on Climate Change has a perfectly suitable name. We do not think there is a compelling case to change it. However, we consider that it is important&#151;the House is making this clear&#151;to spell out with greater accuracy the committee&#146;s powers and its relationship to government. Therefore, I am grateful to my noble friend but I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</p>

He is usually very accommodating and reasonable, but on this occasion he is utterly unreasonable. The committee is undoubtedly an advisory one, so why should it not be called an advisory committee? We ought to be logical but we are not being logical on this occasion. The noble Lord talks about ACAS but that body employs its own staff. Why did my noble friend mention ACAS at all? ACAS is able to enter into contracts. Why did he not mention that fact? In fact, he argued the contrary. I am profoundly unimpressed

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08022520000054"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 13, I wish to speak also to the other government amendments with which it is grouped.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08022520000055"></a>At present, the Bill states that where the committee provides advice on the level of a carbon budget, and the Secretary of State decides to set the budget at a level different from that recommended by the committee, the Secretary of State must state his reasons for doing so. Government Amendments  Nos. 14, 34 and 92 extend that requirement to apply to other aspects of the Bill, including where the Government propose to amend a target, a baseline year or the definition of &#147;targeted greenhouse gas&#148;.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08022520000056"></a>This means that for most amending actions the Secretary of State takes under the Bill, he would be required to make his reasoning very clear in relation to the committee&#146;s advice. I believe that picks up on the intention behind the noble Lord&#146;s Amendments Nos. 33 and 39, and hope that he will be satisfied with that response. I shall explain why the government amendments take a rather different approach.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08022520000057"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 13, 32 and 89 have a similar rationale. The Bill already places a clear statutory obligation on the Committee on Climate Change to publish the advice that it gives on budgets under Clause 27. It is also bound by the Freedom of Information Act to disclose most other material on request. I believe that, to further improve transparency, it would make sense for more of the committee&#146;s advice to be published proactively. These amendments would therefore require any advice from the committee on government proposals to amend a target, a baseline year or the definition of &#147;targeted greenhouse gas&#148; to be published, as soon as reasonably practicable after giving the advice. This would also be subject to exemptions&#151;as in Clause 27(7), for instance&#151;for information that would be protected under the Freedom of Information Act, the Environmental Information Regulations, or by other legislation. The exemptions are set out in our Amendment No. 136.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08022520000058"></a>I will say a little bit more about government Amendment No. 136, which is connected with government Amendments Nos. 132 and 156. These merely tidy up the Bill. When we decided to increase the number of duties on the committee to publish various pieces of advice, we noticed that this would lead to the usual exemption provisions being repeated over and over again. So government Amendment  No. 136 adds a general exemption provision that  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_491"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>applies to all of the committee&#146;s duties to publish advice. Government Amendments Nos. 132 and 156 remove a couple of specific exemption provisions as a consequence.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08022520000059"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 also just tidy the Bill up. Government Amendment No. 37 amends Clause 9(1)(a) to refer directly to the committee&#146;s budget advice under Clause 27, removing any unintended implication that some other kind of advice is needed as well. Government Amendment No. 38 recognises that the committee is already required to publish its budget advice under Clause 27(5).</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08022520000060"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 15, 35 and 93 make very minor consequential amendments to reflect the fact that the Secretary of State will be making statements, not just one statement, under Clauses 3, 7 and 17.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08022520000061"></a>It will be appreciated that the Government are involved partially in merely tidying up the Bill here and in making clear crucial points with regard to a target, a baseline year and the definition of &#147;targeted greenhouse gas&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

Under Amendment No. 14, if the Secretary of State does not agree with what the committee has recommended and proposes something different, he has to,</p>
<ul><a name="08022520000126"></a>&#147;publish a statement setting out the reasons for that decision&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022520000108"></a>Under the present arrangements that Secretary of State is presumably the Defra Secretary of State. This is a matter for the Westminster Parliament; it is not a matter for the devolved Administrations. At later points in the Bill&#151;my noble friend the Duke of Montrose and I have tabled an amendment to that&#151;the devolved bodies are specifically given duties. But this is simply a matter of the Secretary of State responding on behalf of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08022520000063"></a>In this case, it seems to me that the difference between what the committee is recommending and what the Secretary of State says might well affect a great many matters devolved to, say, the Scots Parliament; for example, matters of planning and transport&#151;different matters through which the change might be implemented. How will the Secretary of State ensure that he is carrying the whole country with him when many of the functions that will be affected are devolved? I may be asking a legitimate question; perhaps I should know this. In trying to picture how this will work I see that there could be problems in Scotland. The Scots Parliament disagrees on a lot of environmental issues and other matters with the United Kingdom Government. There could be problems. Will the Minister explain how it will work?</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08022520000070"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, our amendments in the group set up a mechanism for yearly milestones, which addresses a serious gap in the Bill. The Government have obviously recognised the gap but, in our view, have made an unsatisfactory attempt to address it. The rolling annual target mechanism provides for both flexibility and accountability in the budget process. The problem with the budgets as they are in the Bill is that there is no way of ensuring that the first few years of the budget period will see serious attempts and efforts on the part of Government to meet their targets. We would like to think that any Secretary of State will busy himself with reducing emissions from day one of a budget period, but that will be difficult. There is the obvious problem that if there is no accountability within the five-year period, it will be very easy for a Government to blame missing a target on the previous Government, or to have decreased motivation for achieving a target if it seemed likely that the next Government would take the heat. If we are to ensure that reductions happen, there needs to be steady pressure and constant accountability.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08022520000071"></a>Objections were raised about the variations that can occur from year to year that may make numerical targets difficult to meet annually or give the wrong impression about the success or failure of an Administration&#146;s efforts. The rolling factor takes care of that. Each year, the following six years would have their annual targets adjusted, to take into account things such as cold winters, to ensure that the budgets  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_493"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 493</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are met on time. Likewise, the rolling factor can take into account successes that, by happy coincidence, occur in a Secretary of State&#146;s tenure. If a series of heavily polluting power stations were phased out at the beginning of a budget period, the Secretary of State could rest on his or her undeserved laurels and still achieve the budget without making any other serious attempts at tackling emissions.</p>

<a name="80225-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08022520000072"></a>One of the main objections was that it was difficult to set a single figure for a year because of too many contingent factors that would influence emissions. All targets are like that. We have no interest in setting off alarm bells unnecessarily, but the annual report gives the Secretary of State or, we hope, the Prime Minister a chance to explain. All government targets are contingent; the public realise that and we are kidding ourselves to think that there is not a widespread realisation that the nature of a target in general is a goal to be worked towards and one that will be met if appropriate actions are taken. There is not an extraordinary circumstance that derails it. The rolling feature of our proposed targets will provide the most realistic and robust goals and thus accountability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08022520000073"></a>Consider applying the same argument to taxation and the PBR. Just because the fiscal budget is on a five-year period, it does not stop an annual report from being a useful tool for scrutinising a process. Like the rise and fall of emissions due to temperature, the Government&#146;s fiscal budget has to account for any number of extraordinary circumstances. Would we accept the argument that we should not have an annual budget presented by the Chancellor because it is difficult to pin down where we should be for any given year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08022520000074"></a>The Government&#146;s amendments propose yearly indicative ranges of temperatures. This seems to be a fudge. How can it work in practice? For arguments sake, let us say that the first year&#146;s indicative range is a reduction by between 3 and 5 per cent. What would that amount to? It would amount to 3 per cent becoming the target. Any Government would take all the credit that they could&#151;the press officers overworked with reporting that the Government had delivered on their promises. The top end of the scale would become meaningless. A lot depends on how those ranges are set. If there were a minimum gap for the range, it may make the amendments more sensible. An indicative range of 3.00053 per cent as opposed to 3.00063 per cent would seem more persuasive. We want the targets to be at the upper limit of possibility, pushing Ministers to find ways to ensure that they are achieved. At the end of the day, or at the end of the budget period, doing just enough to meet the minimum requirement may not be good enough. We do not want Ministers continually to be able to justify their failures because of bad weather. Annual targets need to send clear signals; these ranges are anything but. It is like running a race with a victory ribbon that moves or, more aptly, it is like running the 200 metres but saying that anything between 175 metres and the finishing line will do. While we appreciate the Government&#146;s recognition that there needs to be more accountability, the

We strongly believe that if we are going to have genuine accountability during the budget period, it should come in the form of rolling annual targets&#151;the rolling annual targets that we propose. I beg to move. </p>

I do not know whether he will be joining me on the Westminster mile for Sports Relief on Wednesday when we can get some energy out and support a charity. On these Benches, we started during Committee and at Second Reading on the basis that five years was too long. We felt strongly that because of the political cycle and of concentration on achievement rather than just setting targets, three years was more appropriate. Not having received rapturous applause from the other sides of the House, we have not put that proposition forward at Report stage. We believe that with five years still there it is critical that we should have distinct annual targets within the Bill. You cannot have a void over a period of five years for a subject as important as this. We were persuaded by the argument made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in Committee, for rolling targets. That is a useful addition; hence our support for the amendment.</p>

<a name="08022520000076"></a><b><a name="80225-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022520000429"></a>Lord Turnbull:</b> My Lords, it is accepted that from one year to the next there can be a great deal of variability either in greenhouse gas emissions or temperature. The particular feature here is that much of that variability within the timescale of a year would be difficult to explain; much more difficult to explain than variations in the government accounts. That makes this rather different. Therefore, I support the Government&#146;s proposal of having a quinquennium, a base year, a target year and a trajectory in between, which is very much the methodology of the delivery unit.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08022520000077"></a>Suppose that, after the annual target, there is one year in which we are below trajectory, by which I mean on the wrong side of whatever trajectory we are trying to achieve. The implication is that you are then setting another set of targets on the basis of that one year&#146;s change in evidence, much of which will be noise rather than signal. The right response may not be to act immediately. If one&#146;s antennae begin to detect something going wrong, it may be to start researching or maybe start preparing what your response would be. Very often, it would not be a good idea to act. Suppose in the next year this variability reverses itself. What do you do? Do you then reset the targets back in the other direction?</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08022520000078"></a>I also find rolling targets confusing. Take the year 2017. This will have been set in the initial target setting of the initial quinquennia. It will then appear as year 5 in the 2013-17 period. It will appear again as year 4 a year later. It will appear again as year 3 in the next year. The public will be thinking, &#147;What was the target for 2017? It has been reset six times in its lifetime&#148;. Part of this mechanism is to provide clarity so that you can see where you stand. Philosophically, I am unsympathetic to the hyperactivity in pot-watching that the amendment implies. I am sure that many

Yet this amendment promotes exactly that kind of impatient policy-making.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08022520000079"></a>Let us remember that we are engaged on a 40-to 50-year journey to decarbonise our society. What is required is purpose and persistence and not a flurry of initiatives. The outcome will be decided by the way in which society&#151;business, families and public organisations&#151;responds. They need a clear set of guidelines and a predictable framework, not one that is dodging back from one year to the next. For those reasons, with the addition of the trajectory&#151;which I think is called the indicative guidelines&#151;that has been proposed, this is the basis that we should support in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="08022520000080"></a><b><a name="80225-0010.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022520000430"></a>Lord Woolmer of Leeds:</b> My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in responding, could clarify two or three queries that I have about the meaning of his amendment. First, are these indicative targets, or targets in the meaning of the rest of the Bill as it stands? Secondly, does the annual target apply for 15 years ahead? It refers to five-year budget periods and there are three five-year budget periods always in play. Is he asking for 15 years to be published, but for the rolling target to apply only for the next six of those years?</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08022520000081"></a>Thirdly, what are the means at the disposal of the Government of the day to fine- tune on this annual basis? Taking into account the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, the implication that I remarked on in Committee of having targets in the meaning of the Bill is that there are policies that can address those. If we are to go down the annual target route, and for that to be in some sense meaningful in its impact on policy, the Government of the day and the committee advising them must have some levers and tools by which they can respond on an annual basis, as opposed to setting a clear trajectory and a clear strategy with clear policies aimed at achieving that. What are the corresponding annual policies that could fine-tune in that way?</p>

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="08022520000082"></a><b><a name="80225-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08022520000431"></a>Lord Puttnam:</b> My Lords, it has been very seldom during the passage of the Bill that I have disagreed with the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, but on this occasion I think that the Government have done very well. They have listened, and their Amendment No. 49 is not at all a bad attempt to deal with a tricky problem. All I would suggest to the Minister is that the term &#147;indicative annual range&#148; is a little broad. It would help enormously if that range could be narrowed to a point where people could have some confidence that it would be so, give or take 5 per cent either side of the range. As my noble friend Lord Woolmer said, the Government are rightly offering the opportunity to fine-tune, but fine-tune means just that. The phrase used at the moment in the amendment is a little broad and is probably broader than is intended.</p>

First, I apologise for the length of my response. A lot of key points have been made, and I am keen to explore why we think the opposition amendments are not a good idea and to get that across in a way that I hope the House will accept.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08022520000084"></a>We had a detailed discussion in Committee on annual accountability, when I tried to explain the problems inherent in setting single-point annual targets, whether or not they were legally binding. We have looked again at the arguments presented in that debate, and it is clear that there is a good deal of common ground about what we are trying to achieve. That is to say, annual transparency and accountability about progress towards meeting the budgets are crucial for all of us, and some indication of the Government&#146;s expected trajectory for reductions over the budget period would help in providing this. It is important that there is no divide between any sides of the House on that.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08022520000085"></a>I note that the Bill already provides a strong annual accountability framework through a number of its existing provisions. Every year, the Government must publish a statement of emissions for the previous year. The climate change committee must then report to Parliament on progress towards meeting the budgets, and the Government respond to the committee&#146;s report. Since our helpful discussions on this issue at Committee stage, we have considered ways in which still greater clarity can be provided about how the accountability framework will work in practice, because it has to work in practice. I will come to those shortly.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08022520000086"></a>First, I want to look at the opposition amendments. Amendment No. 16 would require the setting of both an annual target and a rolling annual target in terms of the net UK carbon account. Amendment No. 18 makes the annual target set under the first paragraph of Amendment No. 16 legally binding. However, the rolling annual target, set under the second paragraph of Amendment No. 16, would not be legally binding. We have to ask: how is it possible to have two separate targets for the same thing in the same year? Let us take the year 2009. The Government would be required to have both a legally binding annual target and a rolling annual target that would not be legally binding. That looks like a recipe for total confusion.</p>
<a name="time_22"></a>
<a name="80225-0010.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08022520000131"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08022520000109"></a>Amendment No. 21 would mean that the Government could set both the legally binding annual target and the non-binding rolling target only at the level recommended by the Committee on Climate Change. Again, these amendments would cut the Government out of the equation, which is another reason why we cannot accept them.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08022520000087"></a>The more fundamental problem with the opposition amendments is that we simply think that a single-point annual target does not work. It is too blunt and inflexible. Instead, the Government have tabled proposals that have at their heart government Amendment No. 49, which requires that the report on  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_497"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposals and policies to meet budgets should include an indicative range for the trajectory of emissions over the budgetary period. We believe that the idea of an annual indicative range is superior to proposals for an annual single-point target. As I said in Committee, emissions can fluctuate from year to year for a variety of reasons, many of which, such as the weather, are out of the Government&#146;s direct control. There is also an inevitable uncertainty between the forecast of the impact of a given policy and actual emissions, again for reasons that may be beyond the Government&#146;s direct control.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08022520000088"></a>We need a system of annual accountability that can deal with these real-world fluctuations and uncertainties but which still provides sufficient clarity about progress to ensure that the Government of the day can be held to account appropriately. We believe more generally that single-point targets, whether annual or rolling, are too inflexible and are likely to lead to regular false alarms. Instead, setting out an indicative range for the net UK carbon account for each year of the budget period combined with greater clarity about the timescales for policies to take effect, as required by government Amendment No. 53, will ensure that the Government of the day can be properly held to account for progress during each year of the budget period, not just at the end of the period.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08022520000089"></a>Within the package of government amendments, Amendments Nos. 67, 68, and 70 are consequential and relate to the annual statement of UK emissions required under Clause 12. These amendments require that the annual statement must give total amounts of carbon units credited to or debited from the net UK carbon account for each year, rather than for the budgetary period in which the year falls, and totals of the net UK carbon account. Without this information, there would be no way of measuring progress against the indicative trajectory.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08022520000090"></a>Since tabling these amendments, I have been asked what my expectations are for the range. How will it work and how wide is it likely to be? Those are critical questions if an indicative range is to provide the right balance between the need to take account of the likely variation in emissions from year to year and the need to provide a robust framework against which to assess annual progress. Clearly, a range will not fulfil its function effectively if it is so wide as to be meaningless. Therefore, we need to look at the likely effect of the main factors creating uncertainties about annual emissions.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08022520000091"></a>One factor is, as I have mentioned, the weather. UK emissions are sensitive to variations in the temperature above or below the average. There will be increased use of heating, for instance, in a particularly cold winter and increased use of air-conditioning in a particularly hot summer. Population growth is another factor. The Office for National Statistics provides annual revisions to population forecasts that directly affect projected emissions. If the number of UK households goes up, UK emissions are likely to increase. There is also the question of policy uncertainty. Not all policies deliver the exact  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_498"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 498</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>emissions savings that we expect when we design them. Some will deliver more, others less.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08022520000092"></a>Variability in emissions as a result of these factors can be seen clearly in the UK&#146;s annual inventory since 1990. For example, if you look at figures for emissions of all the Kyoto greenhouse gases, you see that the reduction was 6.5 per cent in 1996 but 14 per cent in 1999, against a 1990 baseline, with emissions for surrounding years being somewhere in between.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08022520000093"></a>There is also the wider European and international context. Around half our emissions are already capped by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which operates on a multiyear basis. Actual emissions in any one year could therefore differ from our assumptions because companies have decided to bring forward or put back their emissions or abatement action as a result of changing carbon prices or other economic factors outside the Government&#146;s control. Referring again to historical figures, we can see that in 2004-06, when emissions trading was introduced, the effective reduction in the UK&#146;s net carbon account from the 1990 baseline almost doubled. This demonstrates the potentially significant effect of introducing big new policy mechanisms. As the international framework develops, other mechanisms may come on stream over time that will also influence our level of flexibility in how we reduce emissions. The range will also need to change over time as, for example, our understanding of the underlying factors behind UK emissions trends improves.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08022520000094"></a>It is not possible at this stage to put a definitive figure on how wide the range will need to be because of these factors. However, we believe that we are looking at a variation in single-figure percentages overall. That is as accurate as we can get and is not pie in the sky. We are looking at single-figure percentages rather than tens of percentages. We cannot see that it would need to be a great deal wider than that. Obviously, I accept that that is a broad estimate and that more detailed work needs to be done. However, we believe that that represents a much better way forward, which will reflect the nature of reality rather than the spurious precision of a single-point annual target.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08022520000095"></a>I regret that I have had to give such a lengthy response to this issue. In summary, we have problems with the practical effects of the opposition amendments. I say the practical effects and I genuinely mean it because I have been on the other side as well. Sometimes you want to do something but, if it is impractical, it is not right to put it into legislation. It may not be accepted that this is impractical, but I hope that I have explained that it is. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, reinforced that point.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08022520000096"></a>I also believe that, as a whole, our proposals for an annual indicative range provide for even greater transparency on an annual basis about the Government&#146;s expectations and progress while also maintaining the flexibility that we need in the five-year budgetary period. We are at one on that. We want to have that annual accountability within the five-year period, but the question concerns how we go about doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08022520000097"></a>Finally, I do not believe that the points made in favour of annual targets outweighed the problems that those targets would bring, or that such targets would add value beyond the proposals that we have brought forward. Obviously, our amendments are as a package designed to achieve the objective in a practical way. I hope that I have made the point that the opposition amendments are basically impractical. We are trying to achieve the same thing. I ask noble Lords to consider their position and not to press their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08022520000099"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, warned that the amendment could lead to impatient policy making. However, a rolling target provides a constant re-evaluation of where you are going. Indeed, I suspect that part of the purpose lying behind the government amendments is to make sure that there is a constant focus on the issues involved. I am not in favour of Whitehall knee-jerking, as I explained in my introduction to our amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, asked about the form of a rolling target and whether it would have the same authority as the five-year target period. It is not designed to replace the five-year target, which is a crossroads, if one might take a pedestrian view of the issue, whereas the milestones are on the way. This is not meant to replace the five-year budget period; it is intended to provide a path.</p>

<a name="80225-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08022520000100"></a>I say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and the Minister that I recognise that by introducing their amendments the Government have recognised the argument that we were making; I appreciate that. However, we should not be worried about accepting the amendments from these Benches because these indicative targets will induce a degree of numeracy on this issue. Our biggest problem in tackling issues such as climate change is that they should not be discussed only in government circles. They should have a popular buy-in; there should be a sense that the whole nation is seeking to achieve an objective. The displaying of road casualty figures at the side of the road is designed to reduce the number of dead and injured, although we all know that figures will vary from year to year for all sorts of reasons other than the way that people drive. They are designed for a purpose. I believe that these rolling targets can have the same impact.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08022531000004"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Government are determined to continue to drive through the real improvements to the immigration system that we said we would deliver. We have made substantial progress in recent years, and we are seeing the results. These are: record numbers of foreign national prisoners deported last year; fingerprint checks now in place for all visas for those travelling to Britain; and asylum applications being processed more quickly than ever before. This year, we are delivering further radical changes to the United Kingdom&#146;s immigration system, including the introduction of biometric ID cards for foreign nationals and the implementation of a new Australian-style points-based system.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08022531000005"></a>This year, we will have spent over &#163;2 billion on securing our borders and managing the immigration system, and &#163;630 million will have come from fees paid by those using the system. It is right and fair both to the users of the immigration system and to the general public in the United Kingdom that those who benefit mostfrom the system contribute proportionately more to its true end-to-end costs. In setting current fee levels, we established the important principle of setting the fees for our applications and services on the basis of the value to the applicant. We are continuing to apply that principle in setting fees for this year. In order to do this, we are using the powers under Section 42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, which have been amended by Section 20 of the UK Borders Act 2007.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08022531000006"></a>When my noble and learned friend Lady Scotland stood here last year, it was clear that the additional income being generated by the new approach to setting fees would deliver an important boost to the resource spent on enforcement activity. Some fees increased significantly to help deliver the additional resource but also to allow us to keep other fees below normal cost-recovery levels. This year, we are holding most fees steady or increasing them in line with inflation. This includes four of the fees that are covered in the regulations being discussed today: an application for a visa, including as a work-permit holder or a long-term visitor, which will rise from &#163;200 to &#163;205; an application for a certificate of entitlement to right of abode, which will similarly rise by inflation from &#163;200 to &#163;205; an application for a settlement visa, which will rise by inflation from &#163;500 to &#163;515; and an application for leave to remain made at a public inquiry office in the United Kingdom, which will remain at &#163;595. I am sure that noble Lords will take full advantage of the further opportunities to discuss the wider points-based system when we return to the House to set these fees later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08022531000007"></a>Today we are setting fees fornew products&#151;tier 1 and sponsorship&#151;including the fee for an application for a visa under tier 1 general of the new points-based  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_503"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system, where we are consolidating the existing two-stage highly skilled migrant programme process into a single stage and a single fee of &#163;600&#151;the same as the sum of the current fees&#151;and the fee for an application for leave to remain under tier 1 general, where the single fee will also mirror the existing combined fee of &#163;750. Where migrants are already part-way through the highly skilled migrant programme process when we implement tier 1 general, we will charge lower fees in recognition of the fact that they have already paid a fee. These will be &#163;200 for a visa and &#163;350 for leave to remain. We are also introducing a new fee for which there is no existing comparator fee. That is the fee of &#163;1,000 for medium or large businesses to make an application for a licence to sponsor skilled migrantswanting to enter the United Kingdom under tier 2 of the points-based system.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08022531000008"></a>Sponsorship is at the heart of the new system. Employers and other bodies wanting to bring in migrants to the United Kingdom will have to take on certain duties and responsibilities, and we will police sponsors to ensure that they are fulfilling them. Where we have concerns, we will take action to ensure that there is no risk to the integrity of the immigration system. We anticipate 15,000 businesses applying for a licence in the first year of operation, of which 4,500 will be medium or large businesses. We expect to raise &#163;4.7 million from all licence applications, with medium and large businesses subsidising the proposed licence application fee of &#163;300 for small businesses and charities.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08022531000009"></a>The fees proposed for a licence application are fair and proportionate and are set at levels that should not represent a barrier for a legitimate business wishing to employ a skilled migrant worker. The higher fee will apply only to businesses not recognised as small businesses by the definitions set out in Companies Act legislation. Typically, this fee will apply only to businesses with more than 50 employees. The licence will be valid for four years, effectively costing just &#163;250 a year. That is a fraction of the costs incurred in recruiting and retaining a skilled worker with salary expectations in excess of &#163;25,000 a year. The effective annual cost is also comparable to certain other statutory licence schemes, such as the &#163;245 annual fee payable for a licence from the Security Industry Authority. We believe that it is right that small businesses and charities should pay a lower fee, which is only possible if larger businesses subsidise this. We have consulted key stakeholders on our proposals, including the business community. The proposal to cross-subsidise the fees for small businesses has been welcomed in particular.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08022531000010"></a>The fees proposed here are fair and proportionate. They recover the costs of considering the application and help contribute to the true end-to-end costs of the system. I beg to move.</p>

We accept the principle that there should be reasonable charges for people wanting to come into this country. It is only reasonable if they do so that they should make a contribution before they come in.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08022531000013"></a>The cross-subsidisation of the fee charges is, as I understand the Minister, largely to support charities and small companies. Will the Minister confirm that? I was not sure when I read the draft statutory instrument what the cross-subsidisation would  relate to.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08022531000014"></a>The Government have estimated that this will raise an additional &#163;43.2 million&#151;I think that is what the Minister said&#151;over the next five years. Presumably those are annual charges and annual updates, so is the &#163;43.2 million the estimation for five years or for one year? What do those extra fees go to? The Minister said rather enigmatically that they went to border security, but how? What is the contribution made? What is the implication of the &#163;43.2 million not being achieved if, for example, fewer people than expected come through the legal route into this country?</p>

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="08022531000015"></a><b><a name="80225-0011.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022531000049"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, we are grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the regulations. The way in which the Government are using the powers in Sections 51 and 52 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 and in Section 42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 to set fees for immigration services that are higher than a cost-recovery basis has been discussed on several occasions, as I hope the Minister&#146;s notes will have reminded him: in our consideration of the original fees order last March; on the regulations that followed in the same month; on an amendment to the UK Borders Bill in July; and most recently on the amendment order relating to the points-based system in December. Some of the concerns that we expressed on those occasions have not, I am sorry to say, been entirely resolved this evening.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08022531000016"></a>The regulations specify the fees to be paid for a sponsorship licence as &#163;1,000, other than for a small sponsor, which is a charity or a company with fewer than 50 employees. That is welcome in so far as it means that Bangladeshi and Chinese restaurateurs will not be required to pay this fee, as I understand it, although a further statutory instrument is coming down the track that will affect them. My first question is why the fees for small sponsors were not included in these regulations, as that would have saved parliamentary time and the proliferation of statutory instruments, which grow in number every year.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08022531000017"></a>Secondly&#151;I am glad to see the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, in her place, because she will be interested in this, too&#151;can the Minister confirm that institutions of higher education are to be treated as small sponsors, irrespective of their size, because they are charities? In December in the debate on the amendment order, we mentioned calculations that Universities UK gave to us, in which it was assumed that its members would have to pay the &#163;1,000 to be sponsors, and it would be useful if that  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_505"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 505</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be clarified. It was feared that the cumulative effect of the higher-than-cost-recovery fees would be to deter students from coming to the UK, and, although it would probably be too early to detect any such effects from the previous statutory instruments, I hope that the Minister will encourage feedback from any institution of higher education that has any knowledge or experience of the matter. Have the applications been affected at all by the fees that are already in place?</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08022531000018"></a>On the charges for entry clearance in tier 1, the highly skilled migrants, investors and international graduates who have completed their studies in the UK would presumably be well able to afford the &#163;600 being charged for entry clearance because they expect to earn higher incomes by coming to this country. However, the previous fee for highly skilled migrant approval, which was set before these regulations and came into effect last April, was &#163;400, so this fee, as I work it out, is a 50 per cent increase in less than a year. I wonder whether that is simply a bit of profiteering, or whether there is some objective reason for that large increase.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08022531000019"></a>On entry clearance for settlement, the fee was increased from &#163;260 to &#163;500 last April, so that, although the new fee is only a modest increase of 3 per cent, it comes on top of a previous steep rise. Many of those who come here as spouses or dependent children will not enter the work force&#151;at any rate, not immediately when they arrive&#151;so that can be a substantial barrier to family reunification. When the fees were raised the last time, it turned out that representatives of spouses had not been consulted. After the announcement, however, I had several letters which I drew to the attention of the then Minister&#151;I think that it was the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland&#151;protesting about the huge end-to-end cost of bringing a spouse into this country, which I calculated was the highest in the world. Was the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, aware of those representations, and were they taken into consideration in deciding the new charges?</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08022531000020"></a>I note that, in new Regulation 20C, no fee is payable where an application is for the purpose of family reunion under Part 11 of the Immigration Rules, which deals with asylum. Will the Minister confirm that a person who is being granted asylum or humanitarian protection is therefore entitled to bring a spouse and children here without payment of any fee? What has been the practice until these regulations?</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08022531000021"></a>When the higher-than-cost charges were first introduced, there was a formal consultation process, although no indication was given in that consultation of what the fee levels were likely to be. I suppose that, having got away with the huge increases that were then imposed, the Home Office now considers itself at liberty to charge whatever the traffic will bear. Is that why the Explanatory Memorandum gives the reader no indication of how the fees were determined? As it turns out, Parliament should have imposed some obligation on the Government to justify any fee levels that were to be proposed, instead of giving them carte blanche in the original legislation. The best that we can do now is to request the Government, as I do  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_506"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now, to have an audit of the revenue yield of the fees compared with the cost of providing the services in question. I hope that the Minister can at least agree to that modest proposal, so that Parliament can see in the end whether overall the fees that we are being asked to sanction are reasonable.</p>

As always in our discussions of statutory instruments there are a small number of noble Lords in the Chamber, but key points are always made that are very valuable.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08022531000023"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, talked about cross-subsidisation. As I said, the support is for firms that employ fewer than 50 people and for charities. That is what the cross-subsidisation is aimed at. We felt that &#163;300 was a fair and proportionate amount for them. We had a dialogue with them about that figure, and they seemed very content. Indeed, the large firms were also content that there should be some balance here, rather than the smaller firms paying the &#163;1,000.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08022531000024"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the &#163;43.2 million. The amount is for the next five years. In the next financial year, the figure will be about &#163;8.7 million. I thank her for broadly supporting the thrust of this. There is no doubt that, when we consult the British public on this, they feel that people should contribute to the costs of the flow of immigrants. That seems to be a popular step.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08022531000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised a number of issues, the first relating to sponsorship and to encouraging people to get into this country. There were concerns about whether student flow into the country would be damaged. Students will know that they are going to a bona fide establishment. We will produce a list of establishments that are accepted. We will look after students coming into this country in the correct way and will make sure that the correct things are done. Therefore, they will benefit from this.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08022531000026"></a>The noble Lord also raised the issue of fees for small businesses, including regulations made under Section 51, which is the power that we are using for that. The regulations set fees for above cost or for cross-subsidising.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08022531000027"></a>We welcome feedback on student sponsorship and the list of establishments. We have regular dialogue with the stakeholders, including the joint education task force. We hope that we will get some good feedback on that point.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08022531000028"></a>On new Regulation 20C, no fees will be charged for asylum seekers. We are aware of representations about the cost of a spouse visa and the need to ensure international competitiveness for family rates. We can confirm that there will be no fee for an asylum or humanitarian protection family member, spouse or child.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08022531000029"></a>We have looked at the end-to-end costs of fees, how we arrived at them and how they were administered. We have rounded up just above that level and have increased for inflation. I hope that noble Lords will let me go away and look at the audit, and perhaps I can write on that when I am more aware of all the implications.</p>

<a name="08022531000030"></a><b><a name="80225-0011.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022531000051"></a>Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe:</b> My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, perhaps I may raise one or two other points. Universities will be the largest volume users of the new points-based immigration system due to the large numbers of international students, staff and visiting international staff that we welcome to our universities every year. I declare my interest as chief executive of Universities UK.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08022531000031"></a>Because we will be the largest users, we have taken a very active part in the discussions with the Home Office about the new system. The discussions have been lively and sometimes we have agreed with the direction of travel. At other times we have disagreed. Let me say from the first that universities welcome many aspects of the new system. We are very keen to ensure that genuine applicants can navigate the immigration system successfully and easily, but also that those seeking to abuse the immigration system are deterred.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08022531000032"></a>In particular, we welcome the following aspects: that is, student visas linked to a specific education institution, which is an enormously helpful step forward; recognition, through the sponsorship arrangements, that universities are in the best position to judge academic suitability; better information on the progress of people through the immigration system; greater use of online processes; and the new Post Study Work category within the highly-skilled tier of the system that will allow international graduates to apply to stay in the UK for up to two years after graduation.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08022531000033"></a>We welcome the proposals to keep initial student visa fees at a level below cost recovery, although we are still concerned at the high cost of extension applications, and we welcome the proposals for lower sponsor licence fees for charities, as universities are charitable organisations.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08022531000034"></a>However, I should like to draw three remaining concerns to my noble friend&#146;s attention in relation to the implementation of the new system. First, on the IT support to the new system, there has been no opportunity for the higher education sector&#151;I repeat that it is the highest user of the new system&#151;to provide input into the development of the new IT system to support the points-based approach. As organisations which may receive 3,000 or 4,000 new international students every academic year, we must be able to ensure that our records system can &#147;talk&#148; to the new Home Office system. Otherwise, we will be forced down a very inefficient and insecure route of duplicating data entry.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08022531000035"></a>Secondly, on the reporting process, all HEIs agree with the principles of reporting on their international students and staff in terms of compliance with the immigration rules. However, we must aim to ensure that the data returns required by the Home Office align to those required by other parts of government. To do otherwise would be to ignore the better regulation agenda and to force HEIs to have a series of relationships operating on different timescales rather than a single timescale.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08022531000036"></a>Thirdly, the current proposals on the position of visiting international staff would create needless bureaucracy for universities by insisting that all visiting staff have to seek sponsorship from a third-party  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisation and not from the university where they will be based. This seems very strange when universities are willing to sponsor these people and are sponsoring thousands of students and permanent staff. The proposed system would be less secure as the third-party organisation would have to monitor these people, but would not be physically located near them, unlike the university where they are based.</p>

<a name="80225-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08022531000037"></a>I am very pleased that the Home Office has listened to higher education&#146;s arguments and has shown that it is aware of the need to ensure that we maintain the UK as an attractive destination for study and for cultural visits as well as for work. In the spirit of the consultative discussions already established with the Home Office, I hope that my noble friend can reassure me on the points that I have raised.</p>

Perhaps I should have made them more clearly; I have an interest in that I am a chancellor of a university and perhaps I should have identified some of those issues. On IT systems, it is an extremely good point that the PBI system needs to be able to link and work with the other systems. I understand that there is a meeting on 28 February with the officials responsible for this and a number of university IT people to get a better understanding of how our system works. I do not think, sadly, that there is a single university IT system across the whole of the UK, and that will go a long way to helping to resolve some of these issues. However, one must bear in mind that to maintain the integrity of the border and immigration controls, any IT system will need a level of security which may prevent BIA being able to undertake all the suggestions that no doubt universities will have. We will have to work on that.</p>

There will not be a problem that way around, but there could be issues about security regarding alignment, which we will have to develop at the meeting on the 28 February and beyond. The noble Lord is right that there is no reason why data of a lower classification cannot be fed in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08022531000041"></a>I absolutely agree and understand how important alignment of returns will be. None of us wants to increase admin and, wherever possible, our requirements will align with those of other government departments. But they are for a wholly different purpose, so we cannot guarantee that. I know that there was a useful meeting with Universities UK on 15 February, and I thank my noble friend Lady Warwick for her work with that group. We will look to have a further meeting in the next couple of weeks to try to agree our requirements and help out in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08022531000042"></a>We understand the concerns about visiting international staff and the requirement for one overarching sponsor. We are working through the policy of who the sponsor will be and we remain very happy to discuss concerns which were highlighted in that question. The Government believe that the fees are an appropriate charge to the users of these services. Rather than relying wholly on the public purse to meet the costs of applications and processes, they should be met partly in this way as well. There is a general agreement that those who benefit most should contribute most to the end-to-end costs of the system. As such, I commend this instrument to the House.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08022532000003"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this order is made under Sections 36(4) and 38(4) of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. Section 36 of the 2006 Act introduced a requirement for the Secretary of State, in so far as she has functions under the immigration Acts, Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and a chief officer of police to share certain passenger, crew, freight, service and other travel-related information where the information is likely to be of use for immigration, police or Revenue and Customs purposes. Section 38 of the 2006 Act introduced a statutory gateway to allow for the disclosure of similar information to the security and intelligence agencies where the information is relevant to their statutory purposes. This order concerns the information that will be shared under these two provisions. For reasons of brevity, I will refer to the border agencies when speaking collectively about the Border and Immigration Agency, UKvisas, the police and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08022532000004"></a>As Security Minister, I am responsible for a wide range of measures to improve our security arrangements and this order is a key component in our efforts to enhance the security of this country. The increase in global travel brings great social and economic benefit, but it is also placing increasingly heavy demands on our border controls and border agencies. In order to meet these demands, the Government are putting in place the most comprehensive package of institutional and practical immigration reform ever announced, including the establishment of a UK border agency, a unified border force and the e-borders programme.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08022532000005"></a>Neither e-borders nor other joint working arrangements between the agencies will be able to function effectively without this order, as their success is dependent on an ability to share, routinely and in volume, data relating to people and freight crossing the border. Data sharing in this form is not permitted under current powers,  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_510"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which require a case-by-case decision on the justification for disclosure. This is a serious obstruction to the work of the agencies. For example, under existing arrangements, examination of travel data independently by each of the border agencies may result in three interceptions against the same individual, rather than one co-ordinated response. Indeed, one agency may have intelligence on an individual who is also of interest to the other border agencies, but the other border agencies, being unaware of this, would not make a request for those data. This does not help the border agencies to carry out their functions effectively and it does not help the traveller.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08022532000006"></a>This order seeks to address these and other obstacles to joint working between the border agencies by placing an obligation on them to share the travel-related information specified in the order to the extent that it is likely to be of use for immigration, Revenue and Customs or police purposes. This travel-related information can essentially be broken down into three clear categories: information about a passenger&#146;s or crew member&#146;s travel documents or journey; information held by the border agencies, which relates to a passenger or crew member, or their journey, or a freight movement; and information about or related to freight.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08022532000007"></a>In practice, data will primarily be shared via the e-borders programme, whereby information will be pooled in an electronic database to which the border agencies, working in an operations centre, will have shared access. This will mean that passenger carriers will have to supply their passenger data to the Government only once, rather than receiving individual requests from the agencies. The pooling of data in this manner will allow us to develop a better awareness of suspect passengers, travel patterns and networks and to pre-screen passengers and identify those who carry a high risk of involvement in illicit activity. In turn, this will enable us to identify and target individuals who present a threat to the UK and to mount an appropriate, co-ordinated and proportionate response. This will also benefit the genuine traveller, as we will have information immediately available that will help us to make more informed decisions about them more quickly.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08022532000008"></a>Our e-borders pilot, Project Semaphore, has demonstrated that this model works. The data collected by and shared between the agencies have led to more than 20,000 alerts being issued. There have been more than 1,600 arrests for crimes, including murder, rape and assault, and the offloading of passengers who would not qualify for entry to the United Kingdom, as well as to the seizure of many false documents, tobacco and drugs. Semaphore has also made a real contribution to the fight against terrorism. We are at the forefront of new passenger analysis systems and techniques, but we are not alone. Such systems are also in use in the USA, Australia and some EU countries and will rapidly become the norm in the developed world.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08022532000009"></a>It is clearly important to ensure that data are shared safely and securely. We must also ensure that we act proportionately. I am convinced that these fundamental principles of data protection have been and will continue to be met. First, I can assure your  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_511"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 511</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lordships that this order does not give the border agencies the power to share data without limitation. All the data specified relate to a passenger or consignment of goods coming into or leaving the UK. Information to be shared by the border agencies will have been assessed at the outset as likely to be of use for immigration, police or Revenue and Customs purposes. These purposes are clearly defined in law. It should also be emphasised that this order applies only to sharing between the border agencies and, where appropriate, the security and intelligence agencies.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08022532000010"></a>Secondly, stringent safeguards will be in place to protect an individual&#146;s data. In country,information shared between the border agencies will be controlled, monitored and audited through a combination of technical safeguards and operational procedures. Staff will be given access only to information necessary for their role and may be subject to a range of sanctions in the event of misuse of data. Data transmitted to border agency staff overseas&#151;for example, UKvisas&#151;will be transmitted only by secure means across government networks and to government buildings.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08022532000011"></a>Thirdly, we will also ensure, as far as possible, that the data being shared are accurate. Data received from the travel industry will be monitored by e-borders, and existing information, such as visa information, will be used to confirm the accuracy of data received. Where appropriate, corrections will be made within e-borders, with feedback provided to carriers where issues of data quality arise.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08022532000012"></a>Finally, a code of practice, currently before Parliament, will regulate the sharing of the information specified in this order and lays down stringent data protection and data retention guidelines that the border agencies must adhere to. This code has been developed in close co-operation with the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office. Both the code of practice and the test to be applied in respect of data sharing under these arrangements will be kept under review, to ensure that we maintain the right balance between border security and data protection issues. Indeed, the border agencies have committed to reviewing the safeguards and data requirements in the code six months after its provisions commence, with the involvement of the Information Commissioner.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08022532000013"></a>The order forms part of an important package of secondary legislation, comprising orders on both data acquisition and data sharing that will underpin the UK e-borders programme, more effective joint working arrangements between the border agencies and, in future, the UK border agency. It is clear that this package of legislation is essential to the effective management and security of our borders and to ensuring the safety and security of the public. I commend the order to the House and I beg to move.</p>

The orders themselves raise a number of questions and I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I go through them now.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08022532000016"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum refers to the transfer of &#147;bulk information&#148;. Can the Minister explain what that means in this regard? In view of the amount of information likely to be gathered from passenger lists, other passenger information and travel documents, is it the Government&#146;s intention that it will be possible to transfer it between agencies in total? Could a whole passenger list or even umpteen passenger lists be transferred from one agency to another? Will such a transfer require a request to be made from one or other of the agencies and, if so, what requirement under these circumstances will there be in respect of the protection of those data? What did the Minister mean when he said that all agencies would have shared access to the information? I suspect that ultimately this is all going to take place within e-borders, but will there be a common IT system to which the agencies outlined in the order will automatically have access so that information transfers between them? I would be grateful for a little more explanation on that point.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08022532000017"></a>The Government&#146;s IT systems and the transfer of data have taken a bad beating over the past few months. What further assurances can the Minister give that e-borders will be secure in this respect? Will the method of transfer be one that does not put individual travellers at risk of having their details lost in the post? Does the secure government network to which the Minister referred exclude any possibility of physical transfer by disk, for example, rather than a network transfer, so that there are clearly closed and secure methods of transferring the data?</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08022532000018"></a>At present, Operation Semaphore covers less than 12 per cent of all routes into and out of the United Kingdom. The calculated number of passenger movements annually is 250 million. Can the Minister tell us for how long it is intended that the information garnered will be kept on the system and, indeed, whether it can all be held on one system? A brief consideration would suggest that, at a minimum of five years of holding the information, over 1 billion loggings will take place&#151;my maths is not very good, so there may even be another zero to add to that figure. At the current rate of some 16,500 alerts mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum&#151;although the Minister mentioned the figure of 20,000&#151;in 30 million movements, there will be a vast amount of data that is of no interest whatsoever to any agency. How and when will all that data be pruned so that the names of people who have no reason to be on anyone&#146;s database are taken off? Will there be a maximum amount of time that data on persons who excite no interest in any of the agencies can be held?</p>

What costs will the requirement for information put on carriers? They are going to have to hand information over to the Government. Will they have to upgrade their systems to deal with requests from the approved agencies and, if so, what help will they get with this?</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08022532000020"></a>It is a sad fact that experience of terrorism, illegal immigration and crime, including the importation of drugs and the trafficking of women and children, seems to lead us to the inevitable situation where practically everything will be known somewhere about every person in this country. That may be an inevitability, but it is up to Parliament to ensure that this results only in the protection of our citizens and not harassment. The proof of that in terms of this order will be known only when and if the system breaks down, so it behoves the Government to ensure that, unlike some recent experiences, this does not happen with e-borders. Can the Minister confirm that e-borders is a stand-alone system and that it does not and cannot link up with any other IT system holding information on individuals in this country?</p>

We have had the benefit in this case of reading what was said last week in the Delegated Legislation Committee, much of which was repeated in the noble Lord&#146;s introductory statement. For example, Project Semaphore, which is the pilot on the sharing of passenger name records and freight records, has already contributed to the arrest of 1,600 people for serious crimes such as offloading passengers not qualified for entry to the UK, to the seizure of false documents and to contraband tobacco and drugs, as well as helping to combat terrorism. These are all objectives that I am sure all noble Lords will share.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08022532000022"></a>The Minister told the committee in another place that the PNRs for an estimated 355 million passenger movements will be handled by 2015. I do not share entirely the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about the volume of data, considering that IT systems are continually able to share more and more information. I carry around two gigabytes in my pocket, and some USB dongles now on the market at very low cost carry four times that amount. It is not difficult to imagine that the IT system will be capable of dealing with the volume of information required.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08022532000023"></a>I understand that the information will be shared initially by the three agencies involved in the new combined UK border agency&#151;the BIA itself, HMRC and UKvisas&#151;but there are also proposals under consideration for sharing the data with equivalent agencies in other EU countries. Presumably the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I assume that that will require a further order; it would not be allowed by this particular instrument.</p>

I hope that we can have that assurance from the  noble Lord.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08022532000025"></a>I gather from the reply given by the Minister to the Delegated Legislation Committee that for the time being fellow European Union member states will be able to consult the database only on a need-to-know basis. What is the statutory authority for that process and what criteria would need to be satisfied in order to trigger a successful request from another EU member state?</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08022532000026"></a>Are the PNR data to be recorded and exchanged under this order in the same way as the PNR data that we are now providing under the interim EU-US agreement of 2006, or will provide under the further agreement that was under negotiation when your Lordships&#146; European Union Committee reported on the matter last June, and will they be held in a common database? Surely it would be absurd to collect PNR data for the purpose of transfer to the United States and our own internal purposes in a different format.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08022532000027"></a>There is a description of the information in paragraphs 7.4 and 7.5 of the Explanatory Memorandum. It consists of information about the passenger&#146;s travel document details, held in the machine-readable section of the passport, and information normally collected for the commercial purposes of the carrier, such as the name, address and telephone number of the passenger, as well as information about the ticket itself. If the carriers are already collecting and storing this information, what are the additional costs of &#163;242 million that they are expected to incur over the 10 years from 2007 to 2017? The Explanatory Memorandum refers in paragraph 7.13 to capital expenditure by &#147;most carriers&#148;, but surely, if my assumptions are right, this cost will fall entirely on carriers that do not fly to the US and therefore have had no need until now for computer systems that will store the data that are mentioned.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08022532000028"></a>The Minister also told the Delegated Legislation Committee in the Commons that the estimated cost of the programme to the Government was &#163;1.224 billion over the same 10 years. That struck me as being a surprisingly precise figure, unless it depends on contracts with the e-borders suppliers that have far stronger penalty clauses than is usual in these matters. How far have we progressed towards establishing the e-borders operations centre and developing the computer systems that will be needed to receive, process and store the data that are transmitted to it by the carriers? Maybe the experience with Project Semaphore allows us to have greater confidence in predicting the costs, but could the Minister say who the suppliers are so that we can look at their previous records of delivering systems on time and to budget, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, is not always the case with public sector IT systems? The Minister told the committee in another place that the estimated average cost per passenger movement was 14p. I assume that this includes the cost of the stringent safeguards that are imposed by the code of practice that is to be issued under Section 37 of the 2006 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08022532000029"></a>There is no doubt about the need for the collection and sharing of information about passengers and goods entering and leaving the UK for security purposes. As with any very large IT system, however, there is a small risk of erroneous data being recorded and I share the anxiety of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about whether the code of practice to which the Minister referred will deal adequately with the mechanisms available to persons who claim that wrong data have been recorded against them. Will it allow them not only the means of having access under freedom of information to the information that is recorded but good opportunities for making corrections?</p>

<a name="08022540000002"></a><b><a name="80225-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022540000043"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their contributions to the debate and for the good points they raised. On the use of bulk information and what is presently known as the JBOC&#151;when e-borders comes into operation it will become the EBOC, the information centre&#151;data are fed into what is effectively a sealed area, where it is recorded, held, sorted out and analysed. This is done by operators who will have gone through specific security training because, as has been said already, there has not been a good track record, not only in government but in private companies as well, of looking after data and making sure they are correctly protected. These operators have to undertake and pass a training course before they are even allowed to operate and use the machines. The procedure has been tightened-up well and will ensure that that is done properly. The bulk information is analysed within the JBOC&#151;in future the EBOC&#151;and when one finds data that are of interest to an agency in one of the other areas, that information is passed and that agency deals with that information about that specific subject.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08022540000003"></a>I was asked whether discs would be flying around. There is a facility to produce a disc although some of the machines are disabled so that they cannot produce discs because it is so easy to put data on them and remove them. If discs are going to be used, there is a mechanism in place to ensure that these are looked after, logged properly and are only transferred by hand. That is how that will be dealt with within the structure.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08022540000004"></a>Beyond the JBOC or EBOC, it will deal with specific data about someone of interest to that agency, which they will be able to pass to each other. For instance, if it goes to BIA, BIA will be able to talk to HMRC about that specific person. But the bulk data that has been fed in will not be flashing around to different people.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08022540000005"></a>On the issue of Project Semaphore and how long data will be held, at the moment the information is held for about five years, although some police forces hold it for six and HMRC has said that some data may have to be held for longer for various customs and excise reasons.</p>

<a name="80225-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08022540000006"></a>The order does not cover sharing information with other countries although it is open to us to enter into agreements to share data with states. Clearly when we do that we will have to make certain that all the data protection guarantees and so on are in place, using the commissioner and other methods to achieve that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08022540000007"></a>The question of costs was touched on by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. The costs for industry are variable. At the bottom end they are down at 0.04p and at the top end they are &#163;6.31. When we worked it out, the average cost was 14p, as has been mentioned. It is up to the carrier to decide how to meet these costs but we feel that for that amount of money it is incumbent on an organisation to help in what this achieves for the security of the nation. As has already been said, it is amazing what has been achieved with Project Semaphore; the benefits from that have been quite huge.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08022540000008"></a>The noble Baroness raised the importance of protection and balancing that against causing harassment. Exactly what the balance is going to be is the same in almost every context in the counterterrorist area. It is always a balance and we believe that we have it correct. The data that have been gathered and the way we are looking after that data are necessary to help our security, in the fight against serious crime and so on. We have put in place many data protection measures. We are constantly aware that when we are collecting huge amounts of data on people&#151;and, as has been rightly said, more and more data are being held&#151;there are risks.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08022540000009"></a>But nowadays, I am afraid, in any big organisation, to be able to do these things you need to get that data. We have got to become better as a nation at looking after data, not only in pure physical security terms but in making sure that everyone who ever gets their fingers on it and works with it has been correctly trained and understands the full implications of doing so. However, I do not think that means we must not do it. In this modern world, we cannot avoid doing these things; instead, we must become very good at it. Within this context, the way that we will run JBOC&#151;and then, in the future, EBOC&#151;will achieve that.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08022540000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised the encryption of data and whether they would be passed encrypted. The plan is that they will be passed by a secure means and encrypted, but this is an issue that I want to check again, so I shall get back to the noble Lord in writing. All my experience is that people are often not as good at that as they should be. I want to make absolutely certain that that is done.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08022540000011"></a>The European Union is not really part of the order. There will be further debate about the EU and US aspects of it.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08022540000012"></a>The carriers are already collecting some of these data. Clearly they have them there because they need to be able to issue tickets and do other things, but not always in a format that they can pass to us easily, which is why there is an extra cost aspect to all of this. </p>

Otherwise, the carriers would have to collect two different lots of information, for transfer to the US and for use internally respectively. That would be a tremendous waste of resources.</p>

As I understand it, we include the same data fields but we might need some more. Again, I will try to come back with a precise answer on that point.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08022540000015"></a>The noble Lord made a point about the code of practice giving adequate ability for access to, and removal of, data. I think I can assure him that that will be the case. The removal of data can sometimes be quite difficult&#151;we have to know exactly who gives that authority and how it is to be done&#151;but the intention is that it will be incorporated.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08022540000016"></a>I hope I have answered most of the points raised, and I am grateful that they have been, because they are all very valid. One does not like suddenly to apply a requirement to provide more and more, for the reasons we have discussed, but this is important and it will make us safer. It is something the public would expect a Government to do. I assure your Lordships that the necessary safeguards are in place; certainly, I will put a huge effort into trying to protect these data. </p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08022540000017"></a>I will come back on that one point to ensure that that side of encryption is there. I have not yet visited the JBOC, but I was talking to the team in the briefing for this debate. I intend to go there and have a good look at it&#151;it is out near Heathrow&#151;to ensure that it will be as good as they tell me it will. I find that by walking around and looking at things, one sometimes gets a slightly different perspective from when one is told things by people. We are working closely with the Information Commissioner on this issue, and I believe we will achieve what we want. The order is good for this country, and I commend it to the House.</p>

It was clear in the statement made by the Under-Secretary in the other place, Meg Hillier, that bulk sharing of travel-related data would take place under e-borders. I am not sure whether the Minister was referring to the transfer of bulk information or the sharing of that information and whether the sharing comes about in the whole of the e-borders system. We want to clear that up. Information piece by piece is one thing, but just transferring a whole load of data from one place to another is quite another.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08022540000019"></a>The second issue that arises is the concerns I still have about transferring anything by disc. The Minister said in his reply that this would be from hand to hand. The Benefits Agency was meant to have transferred things by hand, but in practice people put items into little packages and gave them to someone else for delivery, and in the midst of that some of them got lost. Does the Minister not agree that the very least that can be done by disc should be encouraged? Perhaps there should be some very secure system that requires only the highest level of intervention if a disc is going to be made at all?</p>

<p><a name="st_165"></a>

You can transfer large quantities of data over the internet. The Government have their own secure internet system, so why is it ever necessary to use discs for transfer?</p>

As I said, a number of the machines have been disabled so they cannot actually produce discs and therefore this would be done on a very exceptional basis. The sort of thing might be, for example, if the security service or the SOS IT system was not functioning. There might be a requirement, in terms of the encrypted transfer, to cut a disc for it. It would be done in very exceptional circumstances. It is not something that would be standard procedure at all. If a disc was cut, it would be done in the very special way that I talked about.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08022540000022"></a>In terms of bulk data, perhaps I can reply in writing and clarify it. As I understand it, the bulk data, by which I mean the PNR information&#151;all the data fields we have asked for from the various airlines, shipping firms and so forth&#151;will all be transferred and pumped into the JBOC; into the organisation which I talked of. I think of it as a great operation centre cocooned and cut off with a huge pipe pouring in. Within that centre, the operators, who have all been specially trained and will not be allowed to use the machines unless they have passed the various tests on looking after data, will do the analysis. They will look at this, will decide, &#147;These two match. This is someone they should be aware of&#148;. That bit of data then goes out so, it is not bulk data pouring out again. That is as I understand it. If it is any different from that, perhaps I can get back to the noble Lord in writing. I think that that covers everything. On that basis, I commend the order to the House.</p>

We are very grateful to see the amendments that he has put down on this issue. Our amendments in this group offer provisions which would allow the Committee on Climate Change to set carbon budgets for particular sectors, should it feel that this would be a useful tool in reducing emissions. They also stipulate that the reports on carbon emissions should contain breakdowns by sector. We think that this is an important mechanism, even if there are not sectoral targets, as it gives a clearer picture of where particular challenges lie. We are pleased to see that, though the Government thought they were essentially negative in Committee, they have been persuaded by our arguments regarding sectoral reporting.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08022540000031"></a>I am most grateful to noble Lords to see that the Government have also tabled amendments to the effect that the advice from the committee to the Secretary of State may include breakdowns by sector that it thinks represent a particular opportunity to reduce emissions. On the face of it, this does seem to come a long way to our position, but appearances can be deceiving.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08022540000032"></a>First, there is no provision for the inclusion of actual sectoral targets. In Committee, we touched on many of the arguments for and against targets for particular sectors. It has been our view since the beginning that it is up to the committee to decide whether these would be beneficial. Crucially, the Government have not followed us thus far; that is, in enabling the Secretary of State and the committee to set sectoral targets. They might claim that it is already in the power of Government to do this by order, but we would like to see a more specific enabling section in the Bill. The important difference between our amendments and the Government&#146;s is the way in which they operate. One of the biggest advantages of sectoral targets is that they provide industries with a framework within which they must innovate; that is to say, they encourage an element of bottom-up approach to the targets. So much of this Bill involves top-down government action. This was a window of opportunity to encourage innovation within the individual sectors. The Government's amendments do not really allow for that. Their Amendment No. 54 stipulates that reports must explain how the proposals and policies will affect the different sectors. That would be a very useful tool for industry, but do we not have enough faith in the industries themselves? Were targets placed on individual sectors or policies implemented that concerned them, they would know better than anyone the impact on their line of work. If we are going to embrace the potential benefits of the idea behind sectoral targets and reporting, we must seek to ensure that a bottom-up approach can be encouraged so that the most cost-effective savings can be made. I have later amendments that I think would re-emphasise that element.</p>

Thus while we appreciate the Government coming some of the way, we still feel that they miss out on some of the core benefits by not going far enough. I beg to move.</p>

I must apologise for having tabled amendments when I have taken so little part in the Bill, but it seemed of such importance that I desired to try my luck.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08022540000035"></a>Clause 27 provides for the committee to give advice on contributions to meeting the carbon targets of the various sectors of the economy. That is fine. However, as the White Papers of 2003 and 2007 make clear, a quarter of carbon emissions come from households and, in addition, some 10 per cent come from private passenger cars, making a total of 35 per cent of emissions which are outside the scope of the committee's advisory role. That seems surprising, because if one thing is clear, it is that we need a major contribution from that sector.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08022540000036"></a>The Government are not saying in the White Papers for a moment that they cannot influence consumption by the household sector as a whole, to which my amendment refers&#151;they list ways in which it can do so. The Energy Saving Trust has written to me with proposals for further enhancing the contribution of the sector. So the proposals are there. When I read the 2007 White Paper I saw, around about the middle, a table showing how cost-effectively the target of 60 per cent might be met and giving projections for what might be reasonable expectations from various sectors, one of which is private households. The expectation is a fairly modest one; only one-third, compared with the overall target of  60 per cent. The Energy Saving Trust says in its letter that it thinks that they should be aiming for 60 per cent. That is another reason why the matter should be open to consideration and advice to the Government. </p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08022540000037"></a>If I have interpreted the White Papers correctly, the 2003 White Paper refers to an objective of moving towards a 20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2010, taking 1990 as a base. It says that we had achieved a reduction of 8 per cent by 1999, which is fair progress. However, it also acknowledged that we had fallen back to 5 per cent in 2001, though it looked forward to a recovery in 2002. When I looked with a magnifying glass at the very small footnotes to an appendix to the 2007 White Paper I saw&#151;if I read it right&#151;that by 2006 we were still at 5 per cent, whereas the target is 20 per cent, or moving towards it. That indicates the difficulty of meeting the target.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08022543000001"></a>Finally, in earlier discussions, we talked about whether the target of 60 per cent is enough. However, the economy will have doubled by 2050 compared with its 1990 base, so that is really equivalent to 80 per cent per unit of industrial or commercial activity. We

He has done the House a good service, and I am grateful to him. I congratulate my noble friend on putting down this amendment, and I thank the Government for moving as they have; they were rather reluctant to move in Committee but they have certainly listened to what we have to say.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08022543000082"></a>Could the Minister confirm that it will be made publicly available?</p>

<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="08022543000004"></a><b><a name="80225-0013.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08022543000103"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, for having brought me back to real people and individuals with choice at a micro-dimension in their own lives which we, in talking about the macro and the global, sometimes forget about. We are all aware that much of the change that will have to take place in how we live and in bringing down our carbon emissions will concern not just individuals being forced to do things but households being given incentives or motivated to make their own, individual, unforced contributions to reducing climate change.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08022543000005"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, has said, households account for some 27 per cent of emissions&#151;and, taking into account their transport, more than that. It is absolutely right that, as we start talking about sectors, we should particularly take the household sector, which I see as focused on individual citizens&#146; decisions on and reactions to global warming, and specify that in this part of the Bill. The noble Lord also brings up a particularly interesting point in looking at the targets against those that the Government already have. We are, indeed, nowhere near that 2010 reduction of 20 per cent. Again, that shows that the Bill is fine in what it does, but just having committees and targets does not mean that we will meet the latter or be successful in this important mission.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08022543000006"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the carbon performance of the UK economy over the past few years. When the Minister spoke about annual targets, it was interesting that he mentioned the big year-on-year changes in total greenhouse gas emissions during the 1990s; if only those still occurred! Regrettably, they do not, as we have almost completely flat-lined our carbon emissions over the past four or five  years, and all the gains made pre-1997 have levelled off. The Bill must involve individuals and households

<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="08022543000007"></a><b><a name="80225-0013.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08022543000104"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, on bringing us back to the reality of how this affects people. I shall always remember the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, about making brave decisions. Is this a brave decision? We shall certainly have to confront that matter after the climate change committee has reported.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08022543000008"></a>We discussed some of these amendments in Committee when we had a useful debate on sectoral targets and I rested my case then on the need for flexibility. We believe that these amendments would considerably constrain this flexibility by giving powers to government to carve up the budget into sector-specific parcels.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08022543000009"></a>As I said in Committee, the Government may be unable to realise fully the emission-abating potential of some new technology. We do not want to be prevented from diverting resources into using this technological breakthrough to reduce emissions more quickly in one sector instead of reducing emissions in a different sector because that is what our sectoral targets say we must do. We do not want to be held to that rigidity.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08022543000010"></a>We also discussed the importance of avoiding a rigid top-down approach to sectoral targets. It is not clear that these amendments would prevent such an undesirable approach. Amendment No. 20, for example, gives no clear role to the Committee on Climate Change in deciding which sectors should be subject to its own targets within a budget, nor how this target would be set. The committee would have a role in assessing progress towards meeting such targets under Amendment No. 158, but would have no role ahead of this stage. This suggests there is a risk that the amendments would result in just the kind of inflexible, top-down approach towards sectoral targets that we are strongly opposed to.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08022543000011"></a>While we are therefore strongly opposed to mandatory sectoral targets, there are also shortcomings with the idea of optional sectoral targets, as proposed in these amendments. As they would be optional, there would be a risk that if the Government decided not to set sectoral targets, nothing more would happen. We would therefore not be any further forward than under the current situation in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08022543000012"></a>I recognise that these are new amendments since Committee stage, and agree that it is important that information is provided on the emissions from different sectors of the economy. There is no dispute between us on that. However, we do not think that Amendments Nos. 61, 78 and 85 would achieve this because they relate to sectoral targets which are optional&#151;and which therefore may not exist.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08022543000013"></a>I reassure noble Lords that this information will already be available, regardless of whether any targets are set for particular sectors. The UK is already under an obligation under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to report the annual emissions of a detailed range of sectors in accordance with the  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_523"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sectoral tables in the common reporting format set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>

<a name="80225-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08022543000014"></a>So the latest UK national emissions inventory, for example, contained UK emissions data disaggregated by key sectors of the economy under broad headings including energy, industrial processes, agriculture and waste. These categories are then further disaggregated to provide more specific sectoral information. In view of the optional nature of any sectoral targets and sectoral reporting under these amendments, we therefore consider that the Government already go further than these amendments propose.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08022543000015"></a>On Amendment No. 145, I should say at the outset that household emissions are crucial, as the noble Lord indicated. In 2005, emissions from the residential sector represented 23.8 per cent of overall UK greenhouse gas emissions. It is interesting that since 1990 the sector&#146;s emissions have reduced by 7.4 per cent. That is a significant change, so there are moves under way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08022543000016"></a>Amendment No. 145 would require the Committee&#146;s advice to include specific consideration of the contribution to the carbon budget to be made by the domestic sector. Again, we think that that approach would be unduly restrictive by requiring the Committee on Climate Change to provide advice specifically concerning the domestic household sector. Instead, we consider a more suitable approach will be to allow the Committee on Climate Change to be free to provide advice on the effect of the carbon budget on any sector of the economy and we have tabled Amendment No. 144 to that effect. While we agree with the need for greater sectoral transparency, we cannot support the amendment, which proposes an approach that we consider too restrictive. It could be argued that it does not enable us to make brave enough decisions. We hope that the Committee on Climate Change will, in its wisdom, turn its attention to these issues at a time that it thinks appropriate.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08022543000017"></a>We believe that government Amendments Nos. 54, 141 and 144 take a much more robust approach to the issue. They provide greater clarity and transparency concerning the effort that individual sectors will need to make to help ensure the budgets and targets in the Bill are met, while maintaining the flexible approach that we believe is essential to the Bill. Unlike Amendment No. 20 in this group, Amendment  No. 144 places a duty on the Committee on Climate Change to identify the potential for emissions reductions in a particular sector or sectors when providing its advice on the level of the carbon budgets. Under government Amendment No. 54, the Secretary of State must explain how the proposals and policies for meeting budgets and targets are expected to affect different sectors of the economy. This will make a demonstrable difference to the Bill and will ensure transparency in how individual sectors may be expected to help deliver the targets and budgets. Together, Amendments Nos. 54 and 144 will ensure that all interested parties, be they business groups, the wider public or Parliament, can clearly see how the budgets and targets may be met through specific sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08022543000018"></a>Our aim with the amendments is to ensure that the Bill maintains a flexible approach for the Committee on Climate Change. We do not think that it would be helpful to set out in the Bill which sectors should be reported on. It is more appropriate to ensure that the Government and the Committee on Climate Change are able to make a reference to any sector or group of sectors they consider most important in the policies to meet the budgets and are able to take account rapidly of changes in technology. Priority between sectors can change for the Committee on Climate Change and the Government. Parliament will not be far behind; the level of information and advice in Parliament on technology changes is far superior to what it used to be. So there needs to be that flexibility. </p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08022543000019"></a>Our amendments would ensure a forward-looking process for the Committee on Climate Change in providing advice and for the Government in setting out how the proposals and policies for meeting the budget may affect the different sectors. This would not be an option; the information would need to be provided but&#151;and this is the difference&#151;it would also be flexible in that we are not laying down which sectors should be covered or requiring the targets to be set for them. That may sound like a damp squib, but it is not intended to be. Our aim is the same and I think that we share the way that we want to travel. We want the flexibility and we do not want the rigidity. We certainly want the information on the sectors, but we want the flexibility to be able to change between the sectors and not be held to a target that we might not want to pursue because it will be laid down and we will be measured against it. But in terms of value for money, pound for pound, if some new technology comes along, we will want to move resources into getting reductions in another sector. That is why we want the flexibility&#151;there is no principled objection just because the amendments have come from the Opposition.</p>

Will the Minister clarify whether he intends that the committee should have the opportunity to look at households? That is of the essence, since they account for about a quarter, plus another 10 per cent through passenger transport. It is such an important area. It is in no way restricting the role of the committee to add it; it gives the opportunity to do more than the Government had intended. We and the economy need such an opportunity.</p>

If the whole policy that we are pursuing is to have success at all, we will have to be able to enlist the whole population as we go along.

We have even seen that our Armed Forces have benefited greatly from being in competition with each other. Whenever there is a juxtaposition of one or two of the services or regiments, they love to compete. If sectors are given targets, they could compare through their five years how each sector is doing on meeting its target and find some incentive in that way.</p>

Presumably, they would be reviewed at least on a five-year basis, allowing for updates, or there may be other ways in which they can be updated. We are just interested in producing enabling measures, leaving it up to climate change scientists to lay down exactly what use they want to make of them.

The final statement for a budgetary period under Clause 14 need not be laid before  31 May in the second year following the end of the period to which it relates. By the time the Secretary of State publishes his action plan to remedy the shortfall, it will be so far into the budgetary period that it may be very difficult to remedy that shortfall during that period. The scenario of falling behind is compounded.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08022543000035"></a>That is why the amendment in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Crickhowell is superior to that of the Government. In our subsection (1) we refer to Clause 12, which covers the annual statement that,</p>

<p><a name="08022543000084"></a>It gives early warning signals for any non-compliance. Therefore, we have divided our compliance mechanism into two parts. First, there is the preliminary plan initiating action to try to prevent the shortfall. Then there is the fall-back position, which is the final action plan, imposing a duty to correct during the following budgetary period&#151;and that period will be almost complete by the time we know what the problem is.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08022543000036"></a>We have drawn our amendment widely so that it can include carbon units that can be purchased. It will allow the Government flexibility to limit the timescale for correction. If you cannot purchase units, trying to resolve the problem of falling behind the target will be much harder. I commend our amendment to the Minister, and I hope that this time he will say, &#147;Yes, you are right. I will take it away and improve our own amendment&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08022543000038"></a>Both amendments provide for corrective action if targets are not met. However, Amendment No. 22 has the benefit of requiring action as soon as it appears that things are slipping and refers to what should be done if,</p>
<ul><a name="08022543000097"></a>&#147;it appears from the annual statement&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08022543000085"></a>that targets will not be met. So, if things are going wrong after year 2 or 3, corrective action can be put in place immediately, rather than, as in the Government&#146;s amendment, Amendment No. 81, corrective action taking place only after the five-year budget period. My noble friend Lord Caithness said that the date in the Bill was 31 May in the second year following. That seems a long time before anything can actually happen. That is an unfortunate aspect of the Government&#146;s amendment. I would be grateful if the Minister would have another look at this and see if he can combine the best parts of both amendments, so that corrective action can take place anyway at an earlier stage than that proposed in the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>

We have been concerned about five-year budgetary periods purely regarding targets, and it takes a long time for policy measures to make a difference in this area. It is rather worse than when a supertanker changes direction. There have to be requirements in the legislation for the Secretary of State to start to take action if it looks like targets will be missed. That is precisely what the noble Earl&#146;s amendment would do.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08022543000040"></a>It is absolutely right that it should not be a historic reaction. The leads and lags are so long in this area. If we are waiting for 18 months before we know what the score is and it takes us perhaps another two years&#151;perhaps six months to work out the policy  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_528"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 528</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>change and probably another two years for that to make a difference&#151;we are talking about a huge lag in time. If there is one message that has come through on climate change from the Stern review or the IPCC, it is that action now saves much greater and further action, cost and distress. Less bravery and courage are needed to take early decisions now than will be needed in the future. That is why the amendment is so important. It may not be perfectly worded, but it means that, when there is a judgement that targets are not going to be met, there has to be a reaction then. That is the only way in which the legislation can start to be effective.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08022543000041"></a>Like the noble Earl, I welcome the Government&#146;s change towards this policy; but, for us on these Benches, the key thing is not what targets and enabling powers are in the Bill but what government policy is in it to meet the targets and change the nature and degree of carbonisation of the UK economy.</p>

<a name="08022543000042"></a><b><a name="80225-0014.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08022543000114"></a>Lord Woolmer of Leeds:</b> My Lords, in order to understand the implications of the amendment and others in relation to carbon budgets, we need to remind ourselves what we mean by the &#147;net UK carbon account&#148; because that is another phrase meaning the budgets. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, in a couple of interesting papers that he has not referred to&#151;I am sure that he will&#151;makes a useful point, although I am not entirely in agreement with the rest of his analysis, which is that sectors within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme cannot possibly exceed their net carbon account, because that is the allocation given to sectors that can make up for that allocation by buying credits or, if they exceed targets, by selling credits. So the net carbon account for sectors in the UK that trade in the European trading scheme have a net carbon account that is set in discussions with the European Commission and the European trading scheme.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08022543000043"></a>Therefore, when we are considering whether there is a shortfall or an excess of a net carbon account, we are talking about sectors that do not come under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme; we are not talking about all sectors. My noble friend may correct me on that, either now or later, but it is an important matter. Noble Lords may think that this might apply to the energy production industry&#151;electricity, gas, nuclear or whatever&#151;but by definition it cannot, nor will aviation, once it is included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The net carbon account figure cannot be exceeded because it is simply the amount emitted minus or plus the amount of credits borrowed. It is important that noble Lords recognise that they are not talking about the whole economy, but certain selected sectors&#151;for example, I imagine, the automobile industry and emissions from vehicles or emissions from households.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08022543000044"></a>We are talking about a particular part of the economy. When noble Lords talk about remedial action, we are talking not about the whole economy but about the sectors that do not fall within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. If, as I hope&#151;I am sure other noble Lords do too&#151;over the next 50 years the EU ETS is expanded and other countries agree to

The implication is that over time it would diminish as trading schemes expanded.</p>

We cannot tell companies in this country that they cannot buy unit credits from elsewhere in Europe. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is shaking his head. In the EU ETS the Government cannot prevent companies buying credits if they are exceeding the budget that they are allocated. If the scheme expands beyond Europe, that will become an issue. My expectation is that any such agreements will be negotiated by the European Union, not by this country. The terms on which credits can be bought or sold would depend entirely on those international agreements. It is inconceivable that if an agreement were made to expand the EU ETS to include say, America or Australia, it would be on the same terms. It is difficult to imagine that it would be otherwise.</p>

I hope that I can put some meat on to that in my brief remarks.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08022543000048"></a>We have discussed previously how the targets and budgets under the Bill will bite on the Government. As we have already said, we believe that by putting the duties into law we are giving them constitutional significance that will inform every level of decision-making. It remains the case that any failure would carry the risk of judicial review with a remedy at the discretion of the court.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08022543000049"></a>The Bill&#146;s existing provisions ensure maximum transparency on whether a budget or target has been met, which means that there would be a considerable penalty in terms of parliamentary opinion&#151;and in the court of public opinion&#151;if it had not been met. However, we have carefully considered the suggestions made in Committee that the Bill itself should prescribe an automatic penalty in the event that the Government miss a budget. I do not wish to undermine the Bill&#146;s existing framework, so the transparency provisions and the option for judicial review remain, but I am proposing a more specific addition to that armoury.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08022543000050"></a>Government Amendment No. 81 therefore requires that in the event of the net UK carbon account for a budgetary period exceeding the carbon budget, the Secretary of State must lay before Parliament a plan setting out proposals and policies for making up the shortfall in the carbon budget. The plan must be published as soon as reasonably practicable after the final statement for the budgetary period is published. Moreover, as with the existing proposals and policies  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_530"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 530</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for meeting budgets, if the plan refers or relates to policies or proposals of any of the other national authorities, it must be prepared in consultation with that authority. This amendment&#151;I shall discuss Amendment No. 22 in a moment&#151;draws heavily on an amendment tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Teverson, and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, in Committee. We believe that this new requirement will focus still further the mind of every Government on practical matters: the need to meet each budget and what they will have to do in the unlikely event that the budget is not met.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08022543000051"></a>Before I come to Amendment No. 22, it is worth responding to a couple of points made by the noble Earl when he asked about the timetable for taking action required by the government amendment. Under the Government&#146;s proposals, we obviously hope that the budget will not be missed but, if it is, the Government of the day will be under enormous public and parliamentary pressure to make up the shortfall as soon as possible. We must leave it to the Government of the day to take those decisions.</p>

<a name="80225-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08022543000052"></a>The noble Earl also asked why the Clause 14 report will not be published until 17 months later. It appears that this is the earliest that the information will be available. The emissions figures for the last year of the budget period will not be available until 15 months later, which leaves only two more months for the Government to buy credits and so on to meet their targets. That is the reason for the 17 months.</p>

<a name="80225-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08022543000053"></a>Both noble Earls asked about things going badly during the budget period. This is the whole point of our proposal for an annual indicative range, backed by the annual progress report of the Committee on Climate Change to Parliament. There will be full transparency about progress during the budget period.</p>

<a name="80225-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08022543000054"></a>Amendment No. 22 clearly has much in common with government Amendment No. 81, but government Amendment No. 81 is a better way forward in a number of ways. First, proposed subsection (1) in Amendment No. 22 seems to duplicate the existing reporting provisions of the Bill. The Bill already has a clear, transparent mechanism for an annual assessment of progress through the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s report to Parliament under Clause 28. As I said, we have also proposed amendments, which we will come to later, that will strengthen this annual reporting progress, including ensuring that the Government respond to the points that the Committee on Climate Change makes. Proposed subsection (1) in Amendment No. 22 seems to repeat much of this but with no role for the Committee on Climate Change and we ask how this would sit alongside the committee&#146;s annual progress report under Clause 28.</p>

<a name="80225-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08022543000055"></a>Proposed subsection (2) in Amendment No. 22 clearly has, as I said, a lot in common with both the amendment that we discussed in Committee and government Amendment No. 81. However, a number of issues still need to be addressed. Amendment No. 22 does not, for instance, address the role of the devolved Administrations if a budget is missed. Will they have a role? Obviously government Amendment No. 81 sets out a process for consulting the devolved Administrations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08022543000056"></a>As I said in my opening remarks, the amendments aim at the same goal&#151;to strengthen the Bill&#146;s framework&#151;but we think that government Amendment No. 81 is the better approach. I say to the noble Earl that I, too, would be much more relaxed if the groups of amendments were such that I could present the Government&#146;s response to Committee to kick off the debate, but there is a procedure for dealing with amendments. I can kick off the debate on some&#151;the next group, for example&#151;but I have not been able to do that so far. I understand that that would be more convenient and make the debate flow better. Effectively, I am technically reporting back to Parliament at Report stage with suggestions from the Government, having listened to what was said in Committee and not trying to do a Committee stage again.</p>

Again, I thank the Minister for his reply. As he rightly said, there is not a great deal between us, because we are still heading in the direction that is common to everyone. He is right to say that this budgeting compliance mechanism, whether it is his or ours, will focus the mind of the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08022543000058"></a>I totally accept the Minister&#146;s point about the devolved Administrations. When I was a Minister, I was told that you must never criticise&#151;or, at least, criticise too much&#151;the wording of an opposition amendment. If the gist of the amendment is acceptable to the House, it is the Government&#146;s duty to put it in the right order. If the right format includes devolved Administrations, I shall happily accept that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08022543000059"></a>On the bone of contention between us&#151;proposed subsection (1) in Amendment No. 22&#151;I listened with great care to what the Minister said. I am not sure that he is totally correct. I want to look at this again in view of the amendments coming along, but we have a real problem in the delay caused through Clause 14. It will be a long time before the final result is known to Parliament. We need a mechanism that is not just the annual report or the stepping stones, although, again, we are grateful for that, as it was recommended by the Joint Committee. However, every Secretary of State should say, &#147;Whoa, something is happening here. Even on a precautionary principle, we ought to be prepared to act&#148;. The Minister said that there is no role for the committee under subsection (1), but there is a big role for the committee, which is to provide the information to the Secretary of State. The whole point of subsection (1) is that it is for the  Secretary of State to act on that information from the committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08022543000060"></a>However, I am grateful to the Minister. I will read with care what he said and will take account of future amendments to decide whether we should come back to this at a later stage. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08022543000064"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendments in this group address a key issue to emerge in Committee concerning the 2020 target. In drafting the Bill prior to introduction, the Government&#146;s view was that a range for the 2020 target would provide additional certainty for all parts of society as to our likely trajectory towards our 2020 target. However, we have listened to the views expressed in Committee. Having considered these in further detail, and as a result of discussions with business representatives and others, it is apparent that the clarity provided by a single target outweighs any additional certainty that is provided by a range. For this reason, with government Amendment No. 23, I propose removing the upper limit for emission reductions that are to be  achieved in 2020.</p>

<a name="80225-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08022543000065"></a>I see that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, has tabled the same amendment. Both our amendments would have the effect that the 2018 to 2022 budget must be set so that it delivers CO2 reductions of at least 26 per cent below the 1990 levels. Government Amendments Nos. 27 and 31 are consequential on this change and tidy up the drafting of Clause 6. As I made clear in Committee, there is no doubt that the 2020 target will be challenging to meet. Analysis for the recent energy White Paper shows that the 2020 target will be met only by taking the upper range of savings estimated for existing policies and measures. This suggests that further policies will need to be introduced in the short and medium terms to guarantee that the 26 per cent target is met, let alone a higher target, and that consideration of these brave decisions has already begun within government. The Committee on Climate Change will also consider the level of the 2020 target as part of its review of  the 2050 target. The approach taken in the amendments is the right one and I submit them to the House.</p>

<a name="80225-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08022543000066"></a>We considered Amendment No. 24 in Committee and our position remains the same. We do not consider that it is helpful to the Bill. Introducing further interim targets would pre-empt the work of the Committee on Climate Change in looking at the optimum trajectory for our 2050 target. We do not see how requiring further targets is helpful. The annual accountability process contained in the Bill, combined with a clear legal obligation on the Government to set each budget every five years, makes further target setting unhelpful and irrelevant.</p>

<a name="80225-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08022543000067"></a>Amendment No. 25 would have the effect that any target set for the period after 2050 may not be expressed as a range. This may be an unduly restrictive approach, simply because, at this stage, we do not know what kind of situation we are going to be in so far ahead. It may be that, in the international context after 2050, countries&#146; emission reduction targets are expressed as a range. In this situation,

<a name="80225-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08022543000068"></a>Currently the Bill allows for a post-2050 target to be either a single-point target or a range. It will be set by the Government, following consideration of advice from the Committee on Climate Change and consultation with the devolved Administrations. With the detailed scrutiny processes in place before a post-2050 target may be set, we feel that it would limit our options to specify now that it may only be expressed as a single-point target. I do not see why, more than 42 years in advance, we need expressly to rule out the possibility that we might have a target at some time after 2050 in the form of a range. We have accepted the argument for a range for 2020, but that is only 12 years away. We do not see why this is of such great concern in respect of any target for the period after 2050. This argument is about demands for clarity. For 2020 it makes sense; for 2050 it does not.</p>

We are very pleased that the Government have seen sense with regard to the top margin of their targets. We fully support their amendment to remove 32 per cent. It did not make sense to provide a range of targets that would legally penalise a successful Secretary of State for doing better than expected. Thus, we have tabled an identical amendment, which sits within the government amendments.</p>

A substantial development in our knowledge of climate change is likely to occur. The Minister acknowledged this. This is why we have been arguing for a dual approach to targets, focusing on both the short and long term. We do not seek to dictate the trajectory to the 2050 target from the start, and nor do the Government, as I understand it. These targets can be amended with the advance in knowledge, as recommended by the committee. However, in terms of business and government planning, these interim targets provide the important scaffolding that will ensure that we reach our ultimate goal in 2050, whatever that may be.</p>

Could the Minister say, in summing up, how 32 per cent was arrived at? Is it 32 per cent of the carbon budget itself? The Minister has mentioned brave decisions a few times. I used the expression advisedly because it was first used at Second Reading by the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, from the Minister&#146;s own Benches, in discussing the Government&#146;s view on bringing forward this Bill. I thought it was an apt expression to use again, and I see that the Minister has now taken it up.</p>

Another 30 per cent is to come from transport, 30 per cent from the domestic sector and 10 per cent from agriculture. However, I have seen different proportions assigned depending on the report you read. What is important is that a 26 per cent reduction needs to be made across the board, and that means a 26 per cent reduction in transport, which is one of the larger areas. The Mayor of London has had problems recently with Porsche over his proposal for a &#163;25 congestion charge for high-emission vehicles. The fact is that he may face judicial review. Such examples prove that meeting the target will be an issue. Whether budgets and the decision-making function of the climate change committee on setting those targets will act as a lever in any judicial review of curtailing certain aspects of transport is one of the issues that may form the basis of other Bills. I do not believe that this is going to be the only Bill for 10 years; I am quite prepared to see further legislation if not next year, then certainly the year after.</p>

We are bringing this amendment back on Report because of the persistent confusion surrounding the process of bringing our budgets in line with those in the international community as well as tying them in with the devolved authorities. In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, explained the Government&#146;s reasons for keeping the wording as,</p>
<ul><a name="08022543000098"></a>&#147;the number of years in the period&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08022543000086"></a>instead of changing it to &#147;five&#148;, which is the number of years required in the Bill as it stands. She noted that at the moment the five-year budget period mirrors the length of the commitment periods under the Kyoto Protocol and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The reason that we should not specify the number &#147;five&#148;, as she expressed it, is that there is no way to assume that the five-year periods will be maintained when the Kyoto Protocol is renegotiated in 2012. That makes a certain amount of sense to begin with, but what other areas of the Bill will be affected by such a decision? The Bill states that there is a duty to comply with international regulations and

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08022543000079"></a>There is also the challenge that will face those who form the Government at any time between now and 2050&#151;I dare say it will not always be the party opposite&#151;and there is a question regarding the devolved assemblies. It is right and proper that the Secretary of State should be swift in bringing the Act into line with the treaties that affect it, but like some of the amendments we have just been discussing, we are still faced with the challenge of deciding on the mechanism for the devolved authorities. Would they be compelled to mirror these agreements as well? How would it work in practice? Are the national authorities required to lay similar orders under this legislation or because of the international agreements? I would appreciate clarification.</p>

He asked how the devolved authorities play into changes to the length of carbon budgets. I am advised that the carbon budgets are UK-wide and therefore all the questions that we had before about how the Bill, as a UK Bill, affects the devolved authorities would apply in this situation. It is therefore the Secretary of State&#146;s decision to take following consultation with the devolved authorities. That is set out in Clause 9. The noble Duke also asked which other areas of the Bill will be affected by changing carbon budget lengths. The answer that I am given is none.

It may be necessary to amend the length of a budgetary period in order to maintain consistency within commitment periods at EU level and under any post-2012 international agreement. In the event that we do so, specific requirements that the annual equivalent emissions should be measured in terms of the overall budget divided by five would mean that the term &#147;annual equivalent&#148; was applied to a period different from a year. As noble Lords will be aware, this was the point that we made in Committee. In this context, since the Committee stage, the European Commission has proposed an eight-year budget period from 2013 to 2020. Although this is still being discussed at a European level, clearly if it was to be agreed we would want the ability to reflect it domestically. The amendment would add significant complexity to the situation for what we see as no gain. I therefore hope that the noble Duke will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

I hope that I can provide some clarification. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked why we tabled the amendment at this point in the Bill. The answer is that this, so far as I can see, is the first moment in the Bill where the number of years in the period is mentioned. It is about the length of the budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08022546000006"></a>The Minister&#146;s reply did not quite take up our point. We are talking about any changes in international agreements.

We were interested to know how the changes, which the Government, having signed up to Kyoto and having passed this Bill, will be legally bound to reflect, will be passed on to the devolved Administrations. I think that there is a little more to be found on this topic, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08022546000022"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. The amendments seek to limit the order-making powers of the Secretary of State with regard to the budgets. This is part of our general theme of empowering the Committee on Climate Change to assume a central role regarding questions that concern scientific judgments. The amendments further entrench the triangular arrangement between the Secretary of State, Parliament and the committee. Essentially, the budgets will not be amended except by recommendations of the committee and subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08022546000023"></a>We believe that it is especially important to empower the committee with regard to the budgets. The way in which the budgets are to be met is the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State. However, the budgets are not policy mechanisms; they are a breakdown of scientific priorities into manageable chunks. In other words, the amount that a Government need to reduce their emissions in a given budget period is not a political decision. There will be some political concerns, perhaps, but the budgets are essentially designed to reflect what needs to be done in the light of the necessity of reducing our carbon emissions.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08022546000024"></a>The amendments are an attempt to prevent the Secretary of State from adjusting his own targets. That is important for a number of reasons. The first is a cynical one: although we do not expect the power to amend the budget period to be used in this manner, we want to guarantee that the budget period cannot be altered to fit because of political expedience. If a Secretary of State were faced with a burden that he considered too great, or indeed if he felt that it was not a priority, we hope that there would be resistance to his attempts to amend the budget. However, we cannot leave this mechanism simply to trust. For this reason, it is important that the recommendations to amend the budgets come from the Committee on Climate Change.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08022546000025"></a>The second reason will be familiar to all those who have taken part in the debates on the Bill thus far. It has been stressed but still needs further emphasis.  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_538"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 538</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Budgets, like the targets, need to have the appearance of being authoritative. We hope that the Secretary of State would not amend the budgets without advice from the committee and we suspect that, in practice, they would not. However, given that most Secretaries of State responsible for this issue will have to report on the completion of at least one budgetary period&#151;and this may be the important target that they have to report&#151;we feel that it is essential that this is seen to come from an independent and authoritative source.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08022546000026"></a>Some concern was expressed in Committee that our amendments would, in effect, remove the role of the Secretary of State. We recognised that there were some risks under our proposals of this being the case. Therefore, on Report, we are bringing back only those amendments that reflect the instances in the Bill in which the Secretary of State is making decisions that would be more suited to scientific deliberation. We feel that the budgets are such an area. If the budgets are not set on such a basis&#151;that is, if they are not founded on the reduction necessary in a five-year period to reach the overall target&#151;on what basis will they be set?</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08022546000027"></a>It seems clear to us on this side of the House that the budgets should not be changed unless there is some scientific basis for doing so. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that other considerations might necessitate a change in the budgets, such as a shift in international law. We hope that this will be taken into account by the committee, as indeed we hope that international law might have some regard for scientific advancement. We see no reason why the committee should not make such a recommendation. I beg to move.</p>

Given that we have had this discussion more than once, I do not propose to repeat everything that I said in the previous debate. We had a similar discussion on the previous amendments, which would have transferred a number of functions from the Government to the Committee on Climate Change. We have also discussed the government amendments to increase transparency and the publication provisions relating to the committee. I agree that this group of amendments concerns the budget while the previous group concerned the targets. Frankly, however, they are not any less important and our view remains the same.

That is where it should be. Doing this on the basis of advice from the Committee on Climate Change is a much better way than having rigid proposals. The advice would, in the main, be accepted, as I have said before&#151;I do not dissent from that. Now I have spoken for twice as long as I intended.

I wanted to say the same thing. Although I agree that this is a closer case, we believe that, at the end of the day, the Secretary of State has to make the executive and political decision as to whether to accept a recommendation, however strong that recommendation should and must be from the Committee on Climate Change. It may concern a finer point, but the decision still needs to be taken by an elected body. Comparisons were made earlier with the Monetary Policy Committee and decisions on interest rates. The point on that, which I do not think quite came out, is that the decisions about interest rates, however much they affect the rest of the economy, are tactical ones and relatively short term. All decisions to do with this Bill are strategic decisions that affect the whole of the economy. That is why they need to be political decisions, not ones taken by the committee.</p>

The amendment, supported by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, implies that the Government can never reflect carefully and reasonably disagree with a recommendation of the committee after publishing their views and putting them to both Houses; but that either House could, without any explanation at all, reject the committee's recommendation. In other words, the supremacy of Parliament would rightly be permitted&#151;there would be no reasoned amendments or need for reasons to be given. However, as we all know, people vote for or against Motions for myriad reasons. You would be hard put to write down on a single piece of paper why people voted in a particular way. As I said earlier, it is not at all clear who would discuss this matter with the climate change committee if either House rejected a recommendation. We would have to try to explain the almost inexplicable: what could be done to overcome this?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="0802262000003"></a>I urge my noble friend&#151;we are becoming good friends across the Chamber on this occasion&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, to reflect on this. This is not a triangular relationship at all, nor is it a relationship of government in relation to the legislature in relation to advice, however expert. I make the point again: either House, even under this amendment, could reject the committee&#146;s recommendation. It would be quite extraordinary if they were able to do so without

I believe that we are drifting into an area of ambiguity that could trap us later. As I understand it&#151;and I am very happy with it&#151;the Minister said that matters which affect the behaviour of people in this country must remain issues of primary legislation and should not be devolved to decisions made by the climate change committee or to secondary legislation. Is that what he said?</p>

We do not want the decision to be made by the climate change committee&#151;we want its advice. The decision will then be made by the Government subject to parliamentary scrutiny. That is the answer to my noble friend. I cannot say that every policy implementing the myriad decisions that will flow will be in primary legislation; statutory instruments may be needed to implement decisions on climate change. This Bill is the main legislation and everything will flow from it, but the decisions have to be taken in a democratic way so that the Government are accountable to Parliament. But perhaps I have misunderstood my noble friend.</p>

The Government&#146;s only role then would be to put those decisions to Parliament, not to take advice or, if you like, to offer the Government&#146;s view. That would not be good enough. We are saying that these decisions have to be taken by Ministers and then brought to Parliament for its approval. That is why I say that politicisation of these decisions&#151;I promised not to use the P word again, so I won&#146;t&#151;and the practical implications for business and how we live, work and play ought to be dealt with in the democratic forum. That was my point about the politicisation: I did not mean it in a party political sense, but that the democratic process and decision-making forum is here and in the place down the corridor, not in the climate change committee. It will adjudicate on those issues in order to give its advice, but the decisions will have to be made in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="0802262000011"></a>One thing seeping through, however, is the notion that the process can, in the end, only become fully satisfactory by making sure that Parliament has every opportunity to discuss these things properly.

Parliament should indeed be informed about differences of opinion that may occur between the climate change committee and the Secretary of State; that is why we have welcomed the moves that the Minister has made on these grounds.

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0802262000020"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 42 I will also speak to the other amendments in this group, which I see as being important. Although our primary focus of the day has been on budgets and targets, there is still a risk that the very thing we are trying to save is being ignored; namely, the environment. This list of considerations that need to be taken into account in connection with carbon budgets seems to omit that concern.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0802262000021"></a>I understand that, when this was previously debated, the Minister gave assurances that the list of things mentioned in this clause is not exhaustive. We appreciate that; however, why is there any reticence about explicitly including the environment? The other amendments in this group shift the language slightly in Clause 10, such that what is considered regarding taxation, fiscal circumstances, energy policy and the other factors is done with regard to climate change and not just a budget decision. This would ensure that what is important&#151;climate change&#151;is driving the decision-making process and not any other concern. The Minister responded to this amendment in Committee by saying that the committee was already under an obligation to take scientific knowledge about climate change into account when considering the decision, so these amendments would be unnecessary and perhaps even muddy the decision-making process.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0802262000022"></a>This seems to me to be the wrong way round. The Government need to consider the impacts of the budget decisions with respect to the real-world things that they affect. However, it seems that in this wording there is a chance that these concerns might somehow take precedence. Can the Minister assure us that he did not intend to make that case? Surely the consideration of all the associated fiscal and social issues of a decision to set a budgetary period should be tempered by the necessities of climate change; that is, the decision should not be rooted in these concomitant issues but in the necessities of meeting the ultimate targets. The budget should be set according to what is absolutely necessary to mitigate climate change and the other concerns should follow. Can the Minister assure us that this is the case under the current wording? Can he explain the process by which considerations would affect the budget setting? Would there be scope to temper the budgets and decrease the necessity to reduce emissions to fit in with economic concerns? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="0802262000026"></a>I hope that offers all the reassurance your Lordships&#146; House is looking for on this issue. We do not believe that Amendment No. 42 will add anything to what is already in Clause 10(2)(a).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="0802262000027"></a>Amendments Nos. 43 to 46 would require the Secretary of State and the committee to have regard to the impact of climate change on various factors rather than the effects of budgets on various factors. I know that the intention is, as the noble Duke put it in Committee,</p>
<ul><a name="0802262000046"></a>&#147;that the changing climate should be the primary factor in our decision-making&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/1/08; col. 757.]</ul>
<p><a name="0802262000039"></a>But these amendments seem to show a slight misunderstanding of the budget-setting process and how the Bill will work.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="0802262000028"></a>The whole idea of Clause 10 is to set out the factors that are relevant in setting carbon budgets. Of course, the Secretary of State and the climate change committee will have to think about the causes and effects of climate change. I have discussed that in the context of Amendment No. 42. I remind your Lordships that Clause 8(2) requires budgets to be set with a view to meeting the 2050 target, so the core aim of the Bill is already embedded in the process.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="0802262000029"></a>It is also vital that the Secretary of State and the committee think about the effect of the budgets on economic, fiscal and social circumstances and on our energy supplies and businesses. Before taking a decision, you need to think what the impacts of that decision are going to be. It seems extraordinary to me that anyone could disagree with that proposition.</p>

<a name="80225-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="0802262000030"></a>I was asked to give an example of how this might work. I give an example on biodiversity, which is covered in my question and answer briefing. As regards how the Government are considering biodiversity in policy-making, I refer to the Severn barrage, as this was raised during the Committee debate on Clause 10.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_544"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column 544</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="0802262000031"></a>This is an example of a government policy decision where it is appropriate that we fully consider the impact on biodiversity to ensure that we can accommodate both of our aims: to tackle climate change and to protect our wildlife. That is why we have launched a feasibility study looking at the potential costs and benefits of the barrage that will look at all relevant issues. The Severn barrage is an example of a government policy designed to help meet the carbon budgets where it is right that we look at biodiversity. I fear that trying to assess the impact of the budget, with little knowledge of what policies are going to be implemented to meet it, could be meaningless and could distract the committee from its core tasks. I have picked out one example, but if I were pushed I could find others. That is an example where I am linking the two together so that you do not lose sight of your main goal, but I am trying to convince your Lordships that the broad scope of the phrase in the Bill that I have relied on,</p>

My noble friend and I believe that Clause 4 is not compatible with Article 6 of the European convention, which accords to everyone the right to a fair and public hearing before an independent tribunal, which pronounces judgment publicly. That is made worse by the fact that the European Court of Human Rights, in a judgment given by 13 judges against five dissentients on 13 November 2007, in the case of DH v Czech Republic, restated the court&#146;s interpretation of the law&#151;especially in respect of waiver of convention rights.

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000012"></a>CEDR&#151;the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution&#151;is widely recognised as the leader in Europe in the field of mediation and alternative dispute resolution. Its mission is quite simple&#151;to encourage, develop and implement mediation and other cost-effective dispute resolution and similar prevention techniques in commercial or public sector disputes and civil litigation. Its networks and strong track record of excellence and innovation in this field enable it often to be a practical and thought leader in the ADR field.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000013"></a>I came to mediation with a number of serious drawbacks to qualifying and passing the relevant examinations. First, I was a lawyer. As one swiftly recognises in mediation, it is very important not to reach any judgment or conclusion; it is for the parties themselves to settle a dispute on terms that they agree rather than ones imposed on them. However, slowly but surely over the period of training, I managed to get rid of those impulsive tendencies, and I duly qualified. Since then, I have increasingly recognised the importance of mediation and have been following very carefully over the past few years how mediation has developed. I recall that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, felt strongly that in civil litigation there should be every encouragement to people to utilise mediation as a method of solving their disputes rather than resort to litigation. Of course, litigation is costly not only to the parties involved but to the Government, who have to set up the court structure to meet demand that is rising, particularly at present. </p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000014"></a>In the amendment, I seek to read across into employment tribunals and emphasise again the importance of mediation. When attempted, mediation often sadly comes too late in the process. In some states in America, it is a requirement that the mediation process be exhausted before the parties are allowed to take advantage of the processes in courts and tribunals. The essence of mediation is that it: first, involves a neutral third party to facilitate negotiations; secondly, is quick and inexpensive, without prejudice and confidential; thirdly, enables the parties to devise solutions that are not possible in an adjudicative process such as litigation, tribunal proceedings and arbitration; and fourthly, involves the parties who either have or represent parties who have sufficient authority to settle.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000015"></a>A lot will depend on the skill of the mediator, of course. It is important for the mediator to have had specific training and experience. Over the years, particularly when I had the honour to be involved as Secretary of State for Employment, I have had the highest possible regard for ACAS. We could suddenly move into a debate about the difference between conciliation and mediation, which would be interesting, but I am not too sure that it would be helpful. My main purpose is to encourage alternative dispute resolution.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000016"></a>The amendment would mean that, before the parties could have access to the tribunal process, they would have to go through mediation. I make no apology for that because, as soon as you get close to proceedings, the issues often escalate in seriousness, and suddenly it becomes difficult to try to resolve them. Often there are outside forces involved that come between the parties, and the whole thing gets to such a stage that it becomes virtually impossible for ACAS or an independent mediator, whichever it is, to bring things to a successful conclusion. No one ever benefits from an extended process. The great advantage of mediation is that it speeds up the process of resolving a problem. It is particularly important in employment tribunals, because one hopes that the parties will have a continuing relationship. It does not necessarily mean that the relationship has to end. The great advantage of alternative dispute resolution is to get the parties together to solve their differences and then to move on, without ever having had to go before a tribunal.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000017"></a>I have probably outlined enough the purpose behind the amendment. It perhaps goes reasonably far in the penalty involved and I would be open to persuasion about that, which is why I am testing opinions at this stage in Committee with a view to returning to the issue on Report if possible. It may well be that ACAS should be given a power more specifically to mediate, because there are some highly qualified people within ACAS who could mediate as well as conciliate. Of course, conciliation is what ACAS is expert at but the purpose of my amendment is to highlight the role of mediation, which I believe has an increasing part to play as we move towards a more effective system of alternative dispute resolution. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0802251000018"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0802251000098"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I admire the work of the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution, with which he is associated. However, I have always understood&#151;and, in a way, preferred&#151;the idea of mediation as a voluntary procedure. As I understand it, in proposed new paragraph (b) in the amendment, it is not only that before anyone can go to a tribunal there has to be a certificate in writing from the conciliation officer that, </p>
<ul><a name="0802251000081"></a>&#147;he has endeavoured to promote a settlement&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000061"></a>but that the parties to the dispute must have,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000082"></a>&#147;co-operated with the conciliation procedure or ... confirmed that they have participated in an independent mediation or conciliation procedure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000062"></a>In other words, I gather from what the noble Lord said in introducing his amendment that he requires people to go through some kind of mediation before they can get anywhere near a tribunal. That seems to take his perfectly good idea rather too far, and I question it.</p>

I feel like saying, &#147;Hands up&#148;, as my friend Tony Benn once said. I would say, &#147;Hands up those who know the terms and history of the Conciliation Act 1896&#148;. I suspect that not even the noble Lord who moved the amendment would raise his hand to that.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000020"></a>I wish to make two points. First, discussion about Clause 5 and things such as this amendment are understandable in the sense that a settlement before litigation is always desirable. In financial services and commercial law, of which the noble Lord has great experience, no doubt mediation is a suitable and desirable method, but that is not true of employment relations and I shall explain why.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000021"></a>Since the imaginative passage of the Conciliation Act 1896 over 100 years ago, the Board of Trade&#151;later the Ministry of Labour&#151;at the party&#146;s request was given statutory power to appoint conciliators in its discretion in respect of any difference between the parties &#147;existing or apprehended&#148;. That is a very important phrase which is still in the legislation today. Under the 1896 Act, the ministry built up an army of industrial relations officers&#151;the IROs&#151;whose work was explained in many publications. They had no compulsory powers, just like today, but they had power to respond to the parties with the appointment of conciliators. That is why they are given notice of claims in employment tribunals today, as they have been for a large part of the 100-year history, which is at stake in this amendment. The conciliators take steps to explain the positions of the parties without promoting a solution as such but they try to make clear the facts and differences between the parties.</p>
<h5><a name="0802251000092"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000022"></a>Accounts of that experience over the 100 years appear in various commentaries, including one based especially on the Ministry of Labour&#146;s own evidence to the 1968 Donovan commission, the book called <I>Employment Grievances and Disputes Procedures</I>, published in 1969 by the University of California, the authors of which are myself and Paul Davies.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000023"></a>ACAS has had perfectly capable mediators, but it prefers to use the method of conciliation because of its experience over a century in which the mechanism has been adapted and varied. If your Lordships look at the history you will find many new steps were taken to improve conciliation, but ACAS by the 1960s was quite clear that mediation proposing solutions to the parties was not the way ahead. By the 1970s, for many reasons, including the difficulties encountered by the impact of incomes policies of both Labour and Conservative Governments, it was decided to transfer the conciliation and the arbitration functions to ACAS, which is founded as an independent service and not subject to any Government&#146;s or Minister&#146;s orders or directions. I must declare an interest as having given advice and contributed to the form and substance of the 1974 and 1975 legislation.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000024"></a>The Minister has kindly circulated the latest draft of the invaluable ACAS revised code of practice on disputes procedures, and in his covering letter he rightly stressed the independence of ACAS. But ACAS did not spring fully armed from the heavens, like Athena from the head of Zeus. From the outset its methods have reflected the experience, lessons and modifications adopted in the layers of gradual change and experience since 1896. That experience suggested that voluntary conciliation, clarifying the facts and measuring the distance between the parties was

That great conciliator of the early part of the century, Lord Askwith, wrote in his book of 1920 on conciliation that, for conciliators,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000083"></a>&#147;the main point is to get the parties together&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000063"></a>with,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000084"></a>&#147;patience, as the first, second and third qualification&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000064"></a>A mediator no doubt tries his best but, in making proposals for solutions, it was found by ACAS and, before it, by the industrial relations officers, that mediation had drawbacks which conciliation did not. As the leading textbook puts it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0802251000079"></a>&#147;Mediation differs from conciliation in that a mediator may make positive recommendations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000065"></a>The IROs and today&#146;s ACAS conciliators have found in common that conciliation is the better technique.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000025"></a>Even the new ACAS scheme, which is a very special scheme made by order in May 2001 under the 1998 Act to reduce proceedings to a bare minimum without any legal activity, has not been adopted by more than a mere handful of the tens of thousands of the cases known to ACAS in employment disputes.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000026"></a>ACAS conciliation is the method which experience shows has triumphed; it should not be lightly tampered with. In 2006-07, the record shows that ACAS arranged settlements in individual employment disputes in 42,805 out of 176,000, and many ACAS interventions also helped to promote a further 54,271 settlements by means of withdrawal of the claim. The Minister said at Second Reading that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000085"></a>&#147;around 75 per cent of claims made to an employment tribunal are resolved before reaching a hearing&#151;a substantial portion with the involvement of ACAS&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/1/08; col. 637.]</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000066"></a>Your Lordships should take note of that quotation before taking any step to interfere by statute with ACAS&#146;s methods.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000027"></a>That leads me to my second point, a quote from the Minister when he claimed a 75 per cent settlement rate with the help of ACAS. He went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0802251000080"></a>&#147;But a significant proportion of cases that reach a tribunal hearing really could be resolved beforehand between the parties, saving cost and time for employer and employee alike&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/1/08; col. 637.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000067"></a>The Minister said not that a further significant proportion &#147;might be resolved&#148;, but that it &#147;could be resolved&#148;. If I had said that, I would want evidence for that fact; it was stated as a fact, not an estimate or forward dream. There is nothing either in the Gibbons report&#151;his experience is in National Health Service mediation, as different from employment as financial services&#151;or in any other research of which I know to support this statement of fact being made with confidence.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000028"></a>I was going to comment on the Gibbons report. I simply reduce it to the same stuff that is in the Government&#146;s report. Sections 4 and 5 advance anecdotal evidence, such as the report&#146;s authors having &#147;heard it said&#148;, or &#147;it has been mentioned&#148;, without telling us who by or what constituency they represent. It is plastered all over the last sections of the Gibbons report, which also says that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000086"></a>&#147;the Government should review existing powers to see whether they are adequate and whether extending them would be effective  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in deterring those cases that have no prospect of success and parties whose intent or action is to waste time and drain valuable tribunal resources&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000068"></a>That is a statement of fact. Where is the evidence for it? Where is the survey showing that those who do not settle with ACAS&#146;s help include those whose ambition is merely to waste time? I know of no such evidence, and advance to your Lordships the contention that there is no such evidence. The intent to waste time is a serious charge.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000029"></a>The tribunal rules already give tribunals or their chairmen power to impose a forfeitable deposit on a claim unlikely to succeed, and the power to strike out claims that are vexatious or unreasonable. Regulations state that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000087"></a>&#147;a chairman or tribunal may make a judgment or order ... (b) striking out or amending all or part of any claim or response on the grounds that it is scandalous, vexatious or has no reasonable prospect of success&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000069"></a>Tribunals strike out very few claims, but they do so when they think that they have no reasonable basis. Sub-paragraph (c) reads,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000088"></a>&#147;striking out any claim or response ... on the grounds that the manner in which the proceedings have been conducted by or on behalf of the claimant or the respondent ... has been scandalous, unreasonable or vexatious&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000070"></a>The very small number of cases that has been struck out on those grounds is of great importance. Of course we all know, or have heard of, an obsessive claimant who just will not give up. Anyone who has had anything to do with the tribunals knows stories of that kind. A special survey by the tribunal service in 1998 found that even if unreasonable claims were defined as claims in which the first legal advice was that the claimant was on to a loser, only a maximum of 4 per cent of claims could be said to be unreasonable. Commentators, such as the main textbook by Professors Deakin and Morris, point out that many of the leading cases were claims in which the lawyer in the first response said that the case could not succeed, but it did. My belief and contention is that there is no objective evidence that that 4 per cent maximum figure is being greatly exceeded or, indeed, exceeded at all, even on that wide and doubtful definition of an unreasonable case.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000030"></a>Can the Minister say today whether there is further objective evidence of this of which I am unaware&#151;or he could write or tell me on Report&#151;that suggests that a substantial proportion of claims that get to the tribunal could be solved by better conciliation? To say that is a criticism of ACAS and the 100 years&#146; experience that it enshrines. The argument that settlements have been inadequate has nothing to support it, nor is there is evidence that overall the tribunals are too restrained in their exercise of the power to strike out. Until proved by further objective evidence, my submission is that public policy in relation to the matters put forward in Clause 5 and in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment should not be guided by such anecdotal beliefs. The ACAS procedures should be left without statutory interruption and amendment.</p>

I explained to him that I had forgotten most of the law that I had ever known, and he assured me that that would positively assist me in my training as a mediator.

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000032"></a>My noble friend dealt with the matter admirably.

<ul><a name="0802251000089"></a>&#147;he has endeavoured to promote a settlement of the proceedings in accordance with subsection (2)&#148;&#151;</ul>

<ul><a name="0802251000090"></a>&#147;the parties to the dispute have, in his opinion, cooperated with the conciliation procedure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000072"></a>I accept that, in the main, mediation works best when it is voluntary, and that the idea of forced mediation should be viewed with some care. I know that the Government are keen to promote mediation. Indeed, I remember going to see the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, when she was a Minister in what I suppose was then the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department or it might have been the Department for Constitutional Affairs&#151;it certainly was not the Ministry of Justice at that stage. As a Minister, she was promoting mediation.</p>

ADR, as alternative dispute resolution has become known, is the flavour of the month. The website of the Ministry of Justice suggests that ADR should be used in a wide range of litigation, but the website does not include employment disputes, and the reason for that is ACAS.</p>

I cannot recall the details of my conversation with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, about whether she thought that it was worth taking it into employment law cases. I was responding to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, saying that not only are the Government promoting mediation, but also the courts. The noble Lord will remember Dunnett v Railtrack, where the Court of Appeal made it clear that a failure to mediate could be taken into account when assessing damages in due course. Before the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, rises, I say that I accept that that was not an employment law case, but it was still a case where the Court of Appeal spoke of the generality of mediation. It is therefore relevant to cite it on this occasion. That is all I want to say at this stage; I have no doubt that we will come back to this matter on Report. I can see that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, seems fundamentally opposed to the idea of any mediation that might undermine what ACAS already does, but my noble friend Lord Hunt said that he could not see why the two cannot run in tandem.</p>

I assure him that in the Black Country they talk of little else. The amendments would in effect force people whose employment rights had been infringed to participate in some kind of conciliation or mediation process before they could bring a claim to an employment tribunal. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for his letter, which I received this morning, setting out what he was going to say this afternoon. He stated that he was sorry that we did not reach Amendment No. 17 on the previous occasion. I, too, am sorry, and sincerely hope that we can make more productive use of time, rather than people having to wait for a long time and then finding that they are out of time to speak.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000036"></a>The Government believe that more disputes could benefit from early mediation. Mediation has an increasingly important part to play in resolving the problems before a tribunal claim is made. We announced on 6 February that we intend to invest significant resources in ACAS&#146;s pre-claim conciliation activities to make this service more widely available and better known. We also intend, through Clause 6, to remove time restrictions on ACAS conciliation after an employment tribunal claim has been made, to ensure that ACAS assistance is available whenever&#151;throughout the process&#151;the parties decide that they want it in the period before the tribunal delivers a judgment. We are also investing significantly in improving the ACAS helpline, so that more people are able to benefit from advice on the various ways of sorting out employment disputes, including, I assure the Committee, through the various, alternative dispute resolution methods.</p>

<p><a name="0802251000037"></a>Just like the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I was a lawyer for some 20 years. I was on the corporate side, so I never had the need to avoid litigation or tribunal hearings. That was not where I made my money every day. I often thought, &#147;Settle out of court? Where&#146;s the fun in that?&#148;. If we can make wider use of all forms of alternative dispute resolution methods that would be a very good thing.</p>

<p><a name="0802251000038"></a>Our total investment in additional, early conciliation and improved advice services will be up to &#163;37 million over the next three years. The Government also recognise the important contribution of other providers of mediation and ADR services in helping to settle employment disputes. They can help to resolve problems which are in their early stages, even before the point at which ACAS can offer its services. In my view that would be complementary to and accretive of what ACAS does and would not in any way substitute or undermine ACAS. They also have a role to play in raising the capacity of employers to manage their employees effectively and to deal with conflict in the workplace. We are currently working with alternative dispute resolution providers of all sorts to examine how they can best promote their services to employers.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000042"></a>Michael Gibbons, in his review of dispute resolution in Great Britain, carefully considered the arguments for requiring mediation before an employment tribunal claim could be considered. That is the essence of this. He concluded that it would not be appropriate to recommend the introduction of mandatory or near-mandatory alternative dispute resolution. As my noble friend Lord Borrie said, we do not wish to make it a condition of a tribunal hearing that mediation has in some form taken place as a legal condition. Gibbons concluded that it would not be appropriate to recommend the introduction of mandatory ADR. Stakeholders who contributed to the review, including representatives of employees and employers, were firmly of the view that if mediation or conciliation were required in all or the vast majority of cases, regardless of their specific circumstances, then it would become just another procedural step in the process and would quickly become discredited. Most mediators would also agree that mediation is effective only when all parties enter into it voluntarily.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000043"></a>Michael Gibbons concluded that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802251000091"></a>&#147;the Review is very reluctant to propose prescription or compulsion in an arena where it has failed so recently ... the Review has therefore concluded that the Government should adopt a voluntary approach to encourage and enable more use of Alternative Dispute Resolution techniques to settle disputes early&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802251000073"></a>Having consulted on his conclusions, the Government share that analysis. Our approach is to replace the prescriptive requirements of the existing dispute procedures with high-quality advice and support to help people resolve their problems, in a flexible and non-statutory way. We believe that this carrot approach will be far more effective than the stick of statutory prescription.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000044"></a>These amendments would introduce a mandatory system of the kind that the Gibbons review decided against. They would make mediation or conciliation after a claim a required step before a tribunal could hear a case. They would also require ACAS to provide conciliation on request before a potential claim in all the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="0802251000045"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn asked where the evidence was. When I was director-general of the CBI I toured the country listening to the problems raised by business. I was told of, especially in smaller businesses, many examples where people left their employment happily&#151;indeed they often had a whip-round for the leaving present&#151;and then, on the day before the statutory period came to an end, in came the claim. Often it came with a &#147;without prejudice&#148; letter that said: &#147;We can wrap you up in all this for months at a huge cost in time and money. Pay us X pounds and it will all go away in the morning&#148;. The system is open to abuse. That is why the Government brought in the original idea. We have to ensure that that does not happen. There is your evidence, my noble friend. I heard many times around the country from business that year after year the process was being abused.</p>

<p><a name="0802251000046"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0802251000106"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> Does the Minister remember that in the year that the Employment Tribunals Service carried out its independent report on all possible types of unreasonable claims, business through the CBI suggested&#151;as it has suggested this year&#151;that something like 17 per cent of cases that went to tribunals were unreasonable and would never be there if only we used some other type of conciliation or mediation? In 1998, the Employment Tribunals Service found that, at the largest, the figure was 4 per cent. Is there any evidence whatever, except anecdotal evidence, that that figure has increased?</p>

<p><a name="0802251000047"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0802251000107"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I assure my noble friend that I am certainly on the side of 17 per cent. I am amazed that it is so little.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000048"></a>These amendments would make a claimant&#146;s ability to access an employment tribunal conditional on an ACAS conciliation officer or independent mediator certifying that all parties had co-operated with the conciliation procedure, a serious obstacle to justice. An unco-operative employer could prevent a claim being heard simply by refusing to engage in the conciliation process. From my previous experience, I am the first to wish to see the employers&#146; burden of red tape and expense being minimised, but I am also the first to seek experience. If you have an unco-operative employer, I cannot see that this system would do anything to help that fairness argument. It is possible that it might even contravene the right to a fair trial.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000049"></a>The matter also raises practical problems; for instance, how will the independence of a mediator be assessed? Does the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, propose some kind of additional regulatory regime to determine that? I would have thought that many Members of the Committee would not wish to add to the burden of regulation on business. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the noble Lord will agree to withdraw the amendment.</p>

He was saying, &#147;Look at the record of ACAS&#148;&#151;and I need not repeat what he said. After that, the record clearly supports the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, and the Minister.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000051"></a>It seems to me that this has to be left as a voluntary position, free from statutory compulsion. In my experience, there were union/union disputes and union/employer disputes but I was never instructed in an employer/employee dispute. However, in disputes where I was instructed, the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, was usually the junior on the other side, and on many occasions his leader, who later became a High Court judge, and I used to sort out the mediation process between ourselves and it worked. When it did not work, we were in the position referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, where one side was bound to win and one side was bound to lose. Most of us at the Bar did not look at it in that way. It was an attempt at mediation and it very seldom worked. When it did, it did, but when it did not, the court decided and that was that. The trade unions have always observed the orders of the court.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000052"></a>I am sure that the amendment is well intentioned, and I think that it was the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, who was referred to as commending mediation. However, he was really more concerned with commercial cases than employment law cases, and I do not believe that he would have intended what he said to go beyond the sphere in which he practised and sat as a judge. Therefore, I am grateful for what the Minister said. I think he is right on this and I am bound to support the Government&#146;s attitude.</p>
<h5><a name="0802251000094"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0802251000053"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0802251000109"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> The responses of my noble friend Lord Henley and the Minister have been well worth waiting for. I was motivated to move this amendment to highlight the importance of mediation. I greatly respect all the experience of my noble friend Lord Campbell and the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, on both the practical and the academic side, but the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, should not be too patronising about alleged lack of knowledge. I do not think that he looked up when he asked us to put up our hands concerning the Conciliation Act 1896. Had he done so, he would have seen us all nodding vigorously. I recall how the Conciliation Act 1896 built on the very valuable history of conciliation boards being developed at the time in key industries such as the coal trade.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000054"></a>Then we had the Arbitration Act 1889, which moved things in the direction of arbitration. The Conciliation Act 1896 was very important because it disallowed Section 3 of the Arbitration Act 1889 and therefore built up over the years an immensely valuable series of conciliation experiences. Therefore, I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, should presume ignorance on our part. We have all looked at the history of this.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000055"></a>I particularly wanted to highlight the role of mediation in order to explore what the Minister told  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>us. He said that more resources are going into ACAS conciliation, which I greatly welcome&#151;&#163;37 million over three years is an impressive sum&#151;and that this is complementary, not substitutional, and will deal with conflict in the workplace at the earliest possible opportunity. These are all steps in the right direction. However, as my noble friend pointed out, the only way that mediation has been given that extra boost in other areas is by a series of penalties, such as the costs penalty now frequent in civil litigation including unfair dismissal. The way in which mediation is encouraged by the Bench in all sorts of disputes involves some element of penalty. On reflection, however, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, and Michael Gibbons that to go in the direction of compulsion is a big step. I therefore want to go away and think about what has been said. However, it in no way removes the emphasis on the importance of mediation that I wanted to put in this debate. I very much welcome what the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Wedderburn, and my noble friends Lord Henley and Lord Campbell, said about the key role of ACAS. I would like the Minister to explore whether there is sufficient power under present legislation for ACAS to provide a mediation service as opposed to its traditional conciliation service. I agree with my noble friend Lord Campbell that there is a great history here, where ACAS has achieved a great deal.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000056"></a>Mediation or conciliation must not become just another procedural step. It must be informal and with the wholehearted consent of all the parties who are then able to resolve their disputes without troubling the courts of law or the tribunals. That was the purpose behind my amendment, so I greatly welcome what the Minister has said.</p>

<p><a name="0802251000057"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0802251000110"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> When the noble Lord comes to rethink the amendment, will he again consider his remarks about the work which has been done, which at one point he seemed to dismiss as&#151;in a nasty sense&#151;academic? The 1954 book by Geoffrey Sharpe and the one that Paul Davies and I wrote were both based on groundwork. We spent two years going around the Ministry of Labour and various industries in order to understand that ministry&#146;s evidence to the Donovan commission&#151;the third work that the noble Lord should read.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0802251000058"></a>I have no ideological objection to mediation. Where it works, it is very valuable. It works in financial services and some parts&#151;not all&#151;of commercial law, but ACAS has shown that it does not want to choose it for employment disputes and there are good reasons for that. That is not an academic judgment, but that of the people who actually do the work with the workers and employers at the place of work. I hope that the noble Lord will look at his speech and rethink how he dismissed the published books.</p>

I am totally in favour of mediation, as I sought to explain in relation to my experiences of these matters in court; if they can be sorted out without going to court, that is always the best thing to do. Perhaps the Minister could confirm this, but I understand that ACAS will have a wider role which will in no way inhibit mediation at any stage if it is apparent. In other words&#151;I do not know, because it is all new&#151;someone sitting in ACAS would be free to say to the parties, or one of the parties because they are not always seen at the same time, &#147;Would you be prepared to seek mediation on this?&#148;. Surely that would be a perfectly proper thing to say and do. If they are prepared to do so, no doubt that would be implemented.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000004"></a>Perhaps I may bring this to a close by saying that I have listened to the noble Lords, Lord Hunt, Lord Campbell and Lord Henley, and my noble friends Lord Wedderburn and Lord Bach. I am a lawyer who never got on his feet in court but sat in smoke-filled rooms the whole time and I am now in the company of so many advocates who have so much experience of this at international level and who are an example to us all. I am reminded of what the great FE Smith said, just before he came into this place as Lord Birkenhead. One day, he was summing up, and afterwards the judge&#151;sadly, history does not say who he was&#151;said, &#147;Actually, Mr Smith, I am none the wiser&#148;, to which FE Smith replied, &#147;That may well be, my lord, but you are better informed&#148;.</p>

I welcome that. I agree with the second point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell. There is nothing between us. We must scrutinise the legislation to make sure that the position we want to achieve is brought about as a result of this legislation. If that has not yet been done, we must make sure we improve it.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000006"></a>To the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, I merely say that I await his reading list. He said that I needed to read, and I am always willing to learn.

Reading lists of people who have experience are worth while. I must tell the Committee that the arguments put forward today are very close to directing ACAS to engage in mediation when its experience since 1896 suggests that that is not the best method.

<p><a name="08022510000013"></a>The noble Baroness said: As I said earlier, many of us agree that fair and reasonable procedures should be in place between unions and employers so that possible disputes, both individual and collective, can be dealt with at workplace level. In passing, I thank the Minister for sending me a copy of the ACAS draft code, which details disciplinary and workplace arrangements.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000014"></a>I am very glad to have that. However, it is not always possible for these procedures to work. That is particularly the case in loss-of-job issues. As I indicated in my Second Reading speech, job loss is for many a traumatic event; it can lead to loss of self-esteem, a breakdown in self-confidence and can sometimes make securing alternative employment difficult. It can even sometimes lead to marriage breakdown. The individual concerned is often not interested in alternative dispute resolution, no matter how well intentioned. He or she will not be satisfied and will not feel that justice has been served unless they have had their day in court. It is for that reason that I spoke as I did at Second Reading and have tabled this amendment.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000015"></a>The individual must not come to feel that procedural attempts are being made to prevent the case getting to the tribunal. Of course, a settlement must be made&#151;everybody agrees with that&#151;but the individual must be assured that the procedures are not being unnecessarily prolonged so that a tribunal hearing is delayed or perhaps avoided altogether. The amendment gives the individual the right to insist that enough is enough and that his or her case must be heard by a tribunal. Only in this way will individuals in the position which I have described feel that the system exists to protect them and to provide fairness and justice.</p>

What sort of steps does the amendment refer to? Is it an application to the High Court to order the tribunal or to give a date? How do you make that application? In other words, I agree with what the noble Baroness wants but I do not know how she wants it done. There is no time limit, which is right; I do not think that you should have a time limit. The amendment says, &#147;without delay&#148;, but somebody then has to decide whether there has been too much delay. There is no provision to make an application to the High Court or to the appeal tribunal. That could be the appropriate way, but you need some means to implement the steps.</p>

I may be unduly sensitive to this because I had to apologise for not doing it at the beginning of our proceedings. Getting a tribunal judgment without delay after conciliation steps and the like have been taken is in accordance with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, if I may paraphrase, says that in the determination of civil rights everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000019"></a>The convention on human rights assumes that the answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, can be found on the ground within a reasonable time. I cannot say what a reasonable time is in any individual dispute; someone will have to decide. My noble friend gives the individual claimant the right to say he has had enough. I do not think that that would impair ACAS&#146;s conciliation work, which the Committee will have seen that I am very keen to support on the basis of 100 years&#146; experience. Article 6 says that you must have a fair and public tribunal hearing within a reasonable time. That is made clear and substantive in my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

I agree that, where the possibilities of conciliation are exhausted, it is important that a hearing should take place quickly to enable resolution of the issue&#151;not just that it is done, but that it is seen to be done.

For cases where there is a seven-week time period for conciliation, hearing dates are generally fixed for the eighth week after receipt of the ET1 claim form; for cases with a 13-week conciliation period, dates are fixed for the 14th week. The small number of cases with no fixed conciliation period is listed for hearing when the ACAS conciliation officer informs the Tribunals Service that initial attempts to conciliate have proved unsuccessful. The Tribunals Service has a target of holding 75 per cent of all hearings within six months of receipt of the claim form, which it has consistently exceeded.</p>

<p><a name="08022510000022"></a>The Tribunals Service will revise its procedures for listing cases if the fixed periods for conciliation are abolished, as is provided for in Clause 6. It may be possible to list some cases for an earlier hearing than at present. Who would be against that? Hearings are listed as soon as practicable, given the need for work to be done in case management discussions and otherwise to elucidate the issues in the claim, and the practicalities of timetabling all the cases where hearings are required.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000023"></a>I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that the administrative mechanisms already in operation are working and will be further refined should Parliament approve the provisions in the Bill. That will enable just outcomes to tribunal cases as quickly as is practicable. There is no need for the additional mechanism proposed in the amendment. It would create administrative confusion if it served to require the prioritisation of cases where conciliation had been tried and had failed, and where the claimant pressed for a quick resolution at tribunal. It could also create an incentive to engage in conciliation without a sincere wish to resolve the case, perhaps merely to delay things or in the hope that people got fed up and went away. Doing so would enable the listing of the case to be expedited, which is surely in the best interests of everyone. It does not make sense to create a system where certain cases could be accelerated at the request of a well informed claimant. Tribunal resources are finite; this would hold back consideration of cases where the applicant did not know to press for an early resolution. I repeat that I sympathise with the intention behind the amendment, but the results would not be workable.</p>

We have to give that serious consideration because I believe that there is a problem here. People want their cases to be heard as quickly as possible within a reasonable time and the question is: what is a reasonable time? A given length of time can be reasonable in some cases and not quite so reasonable in others. We need to examine what has been said. I thank the noble Baroness opposite for her contribution.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022510000048"></a> After Clause 5, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022510000049"></a>&#147;Employment disputes: status of agency workers</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022510000050"></a>The Secretary of State shall make regulations by order providing for improvement in the status of workers in employment disputes who are supplied or engaged by an employment business or employment agency.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000028"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 21 falls within the provenance of the Bill because it concerns the position in disputes of a particular class of persons who at the moment are unjustly treated. The purpose of the amendment is to improve the status of workers supplied to work for an end user by an agency. As Lord Justice Mummery said, in a judgment on 5 February this year, to which I shall return:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022510000051"></a>&#147;There has been an explosion of numbers in the workforce engaged to work under arrangements with employment agencies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022510000040"></a>He estimated the total number to be 1.3 million. Another estimate used, especially in the debate on the employment of agency workers in the other place last Friday&#151;which I hope all Members of the Committee will read&#151;is 1.4 million and there is evidence to suggest the figure is 1.4 million and rising. In other words, workers are being taken on as persons supplied by an agency. The president of the appeal tribunal, Mr Justice Elias, has recently said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022510000052"></a>&#147;Many agency workers are highly vulnerable and need to be protected from the abuse of economic power by the end user&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022510000041"></a>He went on to suggest that a legislative solution is &#147;urgently required&#148;.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000029"></a>This amendment has two perspectives. The first perspective encourages the Minister to make regulations in the triangular relationship in which an agency worker finds him or herself. There are three aspects to the triangular relationship. The first is a contract between the agency and the worker, which is usually stated in terms not to be a contract of employment; it is a contract to supply labour. The second aspect is a contract between the agency and the end user&#151;the employer, in conversational terms&#151;which is not a contract of employment, but merely a labour-supply contract. There is no question of an employment contract there. Thirdly, we have the relationship between the worker and the end user.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000030"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner will deal with the triangular relationship in regard to real temporary workers; I wish to concentrate on agency workers who stay at the same point of employment&#151;again I use a  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC82"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>conversational term&#151;for many months and in many cases many years. That triangular relationship of employment agency workers is increasing.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000031"></a>This month the Court of Appeal in the case of James v Greenwich Council decided that those judges who had said they would infer a contract of employment between the contract worker and the agency and the end user, of which there is quite a history of judgments suggesting that is what the courts should do, gave business-reality to the relationships because the agency worker is working side-by-side with permanent employees, very often on inferior terms and without employment protection rights. The Court of Appeal unequivocally rejected that approach and held that judges must not imply a contract of employment between the end user and the worker unless it is necessary on facts.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000032"></a>Miss James had worked as a care staff support worker at the same workplace for more than three years. She was provided to the council by an agency and paid by means of a payment from the council through the agency to her. The end user paid more than the wage because the agency had a slice of the payment. She was provided to the council by the agency and paid in that way. She carried out her work according to the instructions and control of the council&#151;that is usually one of the tests of an employment relationship in the legal, technical sense&#151;and was on the same rota as permanent employees. She wore a badge describing her as a permanent staff member, but she had no express contract of employment with the end user, Greenwich Council. She was off sick for a while, and when she returned, the council abruptly told her that she was no longer required as it had replaced her. After three years, she was naturally somewhat amazed at that and claimed that she had been unfairly dismissed.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000033"></a>The first hurdle that such a claimant needs to surmount at the tribunal is to show that she worked under a contract of employment, otherwise she has no rights in respect of unfair dismissal, which Miss James alleged this was. The council denied that she was an employee in any legal sense. It said she was an agency worker who was, in legal terms, self-employed. The court refused to imply any contract between Greenwich Council and Miss James, and in its judgment the Court of Appeal said that that must be the pattern applied in future cases to agency workers working, even for long periods, for the same employer. The court went on to say that a contract of employment can be implied to give business efficacy to the case, but only in a very rare instance. Lord Justice Mummery declared that the test of the necessity must be imposed on this relationship between end user and agency worker. He said that proceedings in the tribunals concerning the disputed legal status of agency workers had been put on hold in a large number of cases awaiting judgment in the tribunals. He directed the tribunals to approach the long list of cases on hold to apply this test.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000034"></a>That means that many thousands of workers&#151;an increasing number&#151;who have worked at the same workplace for years, but who are supplied by an employment agency will not qualify for basic  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC83"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC83</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employment protection rights, such as the right not to be unfairly dismissed. I know that there is a qualification period, and they will need that as well as a contract of employment to get a case on its legs, but under this test they do not have a chance of a court implying a contract of employment. The object of this amendment is to provide an opportunity, by regulation from the Minister, to rectify that position, possibly by laying down a presumption that an agency worker who has worked in the same place of employment for a certain period is presumed to be under a contract of employment. That was the approach of one of the members of the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Sedley, in a previous case which was rejected by the Court of Appeal in the Greenwich case. The idea that such a step would destroy the flexibility of the labour market is in my contention absurd. It is hardly extravagant to provide that basic right to agency workers after working in a place for a long time&#151;the right to be treated fairly.</p>
<h5><a name="08022510000056"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000035"></a>There is a second perspective to the amendment. The Minister arguably has a power already to make such regulations, improving the law on workers supplied by an agency. The amendment could be seen as a wake-up call to use those powers, which derive from Section 23 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. That gives to the Minister power to extend certain employment rights, including the unfair dismissal and various similar rights, to a &#147;specified description&#148; of workers, who might not ordinarily be seen as working under a contract of employment, and to clarify who is the employer. The Minister has remarkable powers under Section 23 and the amendment made to that section in Section 41 of the Employment Act 2002 does nothing to make that power irrelevant to this point in the argument.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000036"></a>A decade ago, Lord Justice Buckley said in the case of Montgomery v Johnson Underwood in 2001 that further consideration for the status of agency workers must be given by government and that,</p>
<ul><a name="08022510000053"></a>&#147;the power conferred by section 23 of that Act on the Secretary of State ... to extend the protection of employment legislation to a specified description of individuals might be put to important use in this respect. Continued confusion about whether there exists any protection&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08022510000042"></a>for agency workers,</p>
<ul><a name="08022510000054"></a>&#147;against unfair dismissal assists nobody&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000037"></a>Our amendment gives the Government a splendid opportunity to say that it is unnecessary to accept it because powers already exist to improve the situation under Section 23. I am aware that there is a draft of the European directive, on which I am not relying&#151;but if your Lordships read the debate in the House of Commons of last Friday, it is a central feature in improving the lot of those workers, on which more than 150 Members of Parliament in the other place were prepared to vote as something that was required.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000038"></a>The James judgment makes government action even more urgent. We now know that the triangular structure for agency workers deprives hundreds of thousands of workers of basic employment protection rights. Maybe we can reach some agreement on that European draft  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directive. That seems rather unlikely at the moment&#151;but why on earth should the Government not use their powers under Section 23 of the 1999 Act to make some improvement at least in the legal position of these agency workers who at the moment&#151;as your Lordships will see if they read the debate in the other place&#151;are deprived of employment protection rights? Some will say that that is why the category of agency workers is &#147;exploding&#148;, as Lord Justice Mummery said. If you take on an agency worker, scarcely any employment rights are thought to be basic to modern employment relations, including the right to be treated fairly, even in dismissal. Those rights do not apply to such a worker.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022510000039"></a>To move the position forward, for the reasons that I have given, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08022519000001"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08022519000035"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> During Second Reading, many noble Lords referred to the need to provide employment rights for agency workers, many of whom are vulnerable and often extremely exploited. The TUC briefing drew attention to the need to provide such protection. A Private Member&#146;s Bill, the Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill, has had its Second Reading in the Commons. It proposes to give the 1.4 million temporary and agency workers the same protection that applies to permanent staff. Workers of this type have existed for a long time, particularly in the construction industry, where they have been viewed as being employed on individual contracts and therefore as self-employed, thus exempting the employer from providing the sort of employment rights and protection, including health and safety, that would otherwise be necessary. Nowadays, many are immigrant workers, as has already been explained by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. Often employed via an agency, they are frequently very anxious to secure work and willing to accept lower pay and conditions, thus undermining the pay and conditions established in the relevant industry. There has been a growth in casualisation, which has now become quite a business in itself.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000002"></a>The unions backing the Private Member&#146;s Bill, which include my union, Unite, have undertaken substantial research into the conditions suffered by such workers. The results indicate a truly appalling level of exploitation. Many such workers had been promised reasonable rates of pay and decent accommodation but they actually got neither. The accommodation is often very crowded and, in some instances, unsafe, without proper fire protection. The agency will often claim to stay on the right side of the minimum wage provision by deducting charges from the pay towards the unsatisfactory and inadequate accommodation or for the minibus which takes the workers to and from work. If they get ill, they get sacked immediately. All report a deep sense of insecurity. This is an extremely insecure and exploited workforce.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000003"></a>As I understand it, the Bill in the Commons has a double purpose: to protect non-agency workers being undercut by cheaper, temporary labour and to prevent vulnerable workers being exploited by unscrupulous agencies. Agency staff are employed systematically across the public sector, in the NHS  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and in education, as well as in agriculture and the food and drink industries. The unions believed that the Government had committed themselves to introducing protection for such workers as a result of the Warwick agreement, but they appear to have backed away from the full protection which would be accorded by the Bill and now, I understand, are talking about a commission including both sides of industry. I cannot help feeling that this is a kind of long-grass solution.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000004"></a>There seems to be a feeling that the flexibility which the Government think is so important would be threatened by giving agency and temporary workers the same protection as permanent staff. I am sure that most people would support flexibility for people with young children and particularly for those with caring responsibilities, but what we now have for these 1.4 million people would appear to be disposability rather than flexibility. It enables unscrupulous employers to get work done on the cheap&#151;to the great disadvantage of the employees, including permanent employees, whose rates of pay can be undermined by the existence of such a workforce. It is flexible from the employer&#146;s point of view but exploitable from the view of the workforce.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000005"></a>I should like to see the Government accept the argument that my noble friend Lord Wedderburn and I have set out this afternoon and move the situation forward. I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08022519000006"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022519000036"></a>Lord Campbell of Alloway:</b> With the greatest respect to the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, I oppose the amendment. I accept the problem as recognised by the judiciary by convention and I accept the erudite exposition of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, but this is without the Long Title of the Bill. Of course, there is a problem with these agency workers and, as the noble Baroness said, the matter is receiving attention in another place. However, the Long Title of the Bill is concerned only with the,</p>
<ul><a name="08022519000032"></a>&#147;enforcement of offences under the Employment Agencies Act&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000007"></a>That assuredly has nothing to do with what we are told is the triangular status of these agency workers, which of course I accept. The problem cannot be addressed in this Bill, because it goes totally beyond its ambit. The matter has previously attracted the attention of the noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath, in your Lordships&#146; House, who has spoken to the matter forcefully. He was very concerned by the problem of agency workers. Amendment No. 25 contains a reference to his concern, reflecting what he said in your Lordships&#146; House. I am in no sense trying to get at the merits of the argument. A serious problem has to be addressed, but assuredly not by this Bill. At least, that is what I suggest.</p>

<p><a name="08022519000031"></a>It is not just about enforcement; it is to do with the resolution of employment disputes. The noble Lord said that agency workers are outwith the scope of the Bill, and it is the job of your Lordships&#146; Clerks to suggest that this is so. In putting down the amendment, I made reference to that part of the Long Title. It is right to accept it and not throw it out on the technical ground that it is outside the scope of the Bill.</p>

However, the noble Lord distorts the Long Title. I accept that it is concerned with providing for the right of trades unions to exclude members, but it is not concerned with the enforcement of an offence.</p>

<p><a name="08022519000010"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08022519000039"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> Perhaps I may intervene for the first time in the one hour and 40 minutes that we have spent on three amendments, which always happens when we get into the hands of the barristers. I support the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, in what he said on the procedure. I bow to no one in my respect for the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway&#151;apart from in the damage he does to microphones. I have listened to him for the past 12 years in your Lordships&#146; House say that amendments are not valid because they do not conform to the Long Title. Those of us who have sat through 28 pieces of employment legislation will know that Her Majesty&#146;s Government often put in provisions that bear little relationship to the general title of the Bill. If, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, indicated, his amendment falls simply because it does not meet that procedural requirement, it is not beyond the wit of the expensively paid people behind the Minister to ensure that it does.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000011"></a>At a more fundamental level, I wonder whether this debate is not a little premature. I heard on the radio this morning that a meeting between the Prime Minister and the trade union movement about this issue is being held in Downing Street as we speak. Would it not be better if the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, withdrew his amendment until we knew what our Prime Minister has decided to put forward in relation to this issue? Are we not in danger of having a theoretical debate when we do not yet know what He Who Shall Be Obeyed has decided?</p>

I make two or three small points. First, I support what my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway said when he doubted that this was within the ambit of the Long Title. It might be, but my noble friend was saying that it is not quite within the spirit of the Bill. I would like to offer one small bit of advice to the noble Lord, Lord Jones, for when he winds up. The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, comes from the fact that both noble Lords do not like agency workers&#151;the idea of  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>temporary workers&#151;that they have fewer rights than other workers, and that there should be a flexible labour market with all the advantages there are for both employers and employees.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000013"></a>One should emphasise the fact that for many employees there are considerable advantages in being agency workers and suchlike. I would have thought that the simple solution for the Minister is to reject the amendment because it is simply designed to make it much harder for people to seek employment as agency workers or as temporary workers. The same should apply to the Private Member&#146;s Bill that was discussed in another place last Friday. No doubt the noble Lord will give the Government&#146;s view on that and on this amendment in due course.</p>

I was suggesting that no one knows what will happen in the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the trade union movement. We do not yet know whether the point the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, made, as reflected in the amendment, will be agreed by the Government. We are asking the Minister to make a comment on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, before he knows the result of the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the trade union movement. Therefore, in order to expedite the passage of this Bill, would it not be better to postpone the debate until Report, when we will know better what has occurred at Downing Street today? That is all I was suggesting.</p>

Like the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, I worked for the same trade union as her and at the same time, and took many industrial and employment tribunal cases. Therefore, I feel that I have a strong view that how the Bill is framed will not entirely meet the needs of those who seek to benefit from employment tribunals.</p>

<p><a name="08022519000017"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, that the point he makes has some validity. Some discussions are ongoing. Indeed, a Private Member&#146;s Bill is currently going through the other place. I wish Mr Miller all luck with it. At the same time arguments are to be advanced in favour of agency workers which I believe are germane to the Bill we are discussing. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, I say that surely the Clerks know their business well enough that if they felt this was outwith the scope of the Bill it would not be in the Marshalled List for us today.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000018"></a>I do not wish to rehearse the arguments in any great detail on behalf of my noble friends Lady Turner and Lord Wedderburn. But the point has to be made that it is not in any sense a contradiction in terms to argue for this amendment and for agency workers to have comparable rights to permanent employees&#151;even if not the same rights&#151;and at the same time deny that flexibility of work benefits both some employers and some employees. As I said at Second Reading, where it benefits employees, fine&#151;let those employees work quite happily in situations and under conditions that suit them, perhaps because of family arrangements or semi-retirement or because they can only work at certain times of the year. That is fine, but there are many people seeking full-time employment whose only recourse is to agency work, which is the very antithesis of full-time, permanent employment. I was struck by the regular use of &#147;end user&#148; by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. That seems utterly appropriate because it is what the end users are doing to the people whom they employ on an agency basis&#151;they are using them. That is quite clear. I am sure that the term was not meant unkindly in that way, but that is what it amounts to and it has to be exposed for what it is.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000019"></a>Many of the arguments were made in an excellent debate on Friday in another place. However, the bottom line is that there is insecurity for agency workers. I have not been an employer but I should have thought that any employer would want the people working for him or her to feel sufficiently secure in doing a job in order to contribute to the benefit of that business, service, voluntary organisation or whatever. As was backed up in some of the testimonies given in respect of the Bill in the other place, if people feel insecure&#151;if they cannot join pension schemes, get proper paid holidays or get reduced sick pay&#151;that impacts not just on those individuals but on their families. When we are talking about flexible working, there has to be an element of fairness, and I shall come back to that in just a second.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000020"></a>We heard all sorts of stories on Friday about aspects of salaries&#151;uniforms, travel and accommodation&#151;that are directly deducted and over which people have no choice and there is no opt-out. People have to accept them whether they want them or need them. The final insult is being charged for cheque-cashing facilities at the end of the week. These are just employers&#146; ruses and I do not think that anyone can seriously seek to defend them. No training is offered and, as I said earlier, there is no security. Many such employees go well beyond the qualifying limit for taking cases to employment tribunals and it is iniquitous that they should not have the right to do that. If an employer acted in a way that would enable a permanent employee to take his or her case to a tribunal, the same should be true for someone who is not a permanent employee.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000021"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn said that this was really about the right of people to be treated fairly. When the Minister replied to the debate on Amendments Nos. 17 to 19, he reminded us that he was the first to speak up in favour of reducing what he termed the employers&#146; burden, but then he said that he was also the first to seek fairness in employment. That is exactly the nub of the argument  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>here. This is about fairness, and fairness is a double-edged sword. You cannot have fairness on one side: if it is fair to one person, it must be fair to the other. When the Minister replies to the debate, I ask him to bear that in mind in relation to the right of agency workers to take their cases to employment tribunals.</p>

<p><a name="08022519000022"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022519000044"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I have listened carefully to all the submissions and, first, I make a plea that we remove the alarmist language from this whole debate. From my noble friend Lord Wedderburn I heard that this is a complete group of workers that is &#147;unjustly treated&#148;. That is not true. Some are but many are not. I heard about &#147;abuse of economic power&#148; and about people needing to be &#147;protected&#148;. Just now from my noble friend Lord Watson, I heard about what is being done to these people and that it needs to be &#147;exposed for what it is&#148;. At the same time, from my noble friend Lady Turner I heard the words &#147;both sides of industry&#148;. All that smacks of 1970. It smacks of exactly what the private sector&#151;both unions and employers&#151;over the past 15 to 20 years, and especially the past 10, have worked so hard to avoid. One reason why we have the most successful economy in the whole of Europe is that we have the most flexible labour market. Whatever certain people with vested interests might tell you, there is a connection between low levels of unemployment and high levels of flexibility.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000023"></a>I do not recognise the word &#147;industry&#148;; I recognise the world of employment, of business and of the public sector. I do not see sides. Six and a half years as director-general of the CBI made me understand that there is only one side in the private sector: it is those people who come together to create a successful undertaking from which everybody can benefit. It is not true that every one of those people who enters a contract by which they can retain agency workers works in such a way as to do them down. I come across many agencies that train agency workers a great deal, based on the selfish realisation that the more they train them, the higher the rate that they can command for entering a contract for the provision of their services and, by definition, the greater the take-home pay of the agency workers.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000024"></a>I hope that, on this amendment and Amendment No. 26, and when the House debates what is happening in another place now, we will remove the alarmist, damaging vocabulary that belongs to another age. We are in the 21st-century world of work; there are many people across Britain who do not recognise the vocabulary that my noble friends have used. Flexibility is a two-way street. Agency work often provides an entry to the world of work that has been denied to many people in the past. It provides an entry for those who come out of prison and try to go straight; it provides an entry for many a woman who is trying to get back into the world of work after some time out, either to have children or to care for an elderly relative. It provides an entry for students during their summer vacations, allowing them to get used to the world of work and to learn that the pleasure of earning a living is not entirely ours.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000025"></a>The 21st-century world of work contains people who abuse the situation, who treat agency workers abominably and who need to feel the power of regulation to make sure that the abuse stops and to ensure the fairness&#151;I thank the noble Lord, Lord Watson, for saying it&#151;that I respect in the workplace. However, it is a minority. They must be weeded out and it must stop. I was very influenced by going to BMW&#146;s Mini plant in Oxford. It is a fabulous brand; the engine is made in Britain. It sells around the world, creating jobs and wealth for this nation. While it has a fully unionised, full-time workforce, it is huge user of agency workers, to deal with peaks and troughs and the availability of student labour in the summer, when holidays eat into the full-time workforce commitment. The owners of the plant said to me: &#147;If this stops, if this puts us on an equal footing with Germany, France, Spain and Scandinavia, please explain to us why we should carry on investing in this country&#148;. They are not gangmasters; they are not the people who should be weeded out and stopped; it is a high-class German manufacturer making a fabulous, globally successful product in this country, creating quality jobs and caring for its workforce, and saying that the ability to have a flexible workforce with agency workers is not only something that it values but is one of the reasons that it invests in this country. I as chairman of UK Trade &amp; Investment valued its investment and trust in my nation enormously.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000026"></a>I am with my noble friends when they say that we must stop the abuse that goes on, but I plead with them to stop the alarmist language. Let us perhaps find a term which applies if someone is in a relationship with an employer for such a long time that, as my noble friend Lord Wedderburn said, they are employees and deserve the protection as such.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000027"></a>The Government are not against that. I remind my noble friends that the Government are elected to govern for the whole country, not one vested interest&#151;be it the CBI, the TUC or anybody else. The Government are not against saying, &#147;Let us have some regulations and protection in place for people in the same contractual relationship for so long a period&#148;. As the lady from Greenwich found out, they are frankly being treated as an employee and should be protected as such.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000028"></a>Let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater, or get to a point where the big and quality investors in the country leave. Globalisation gives them choice, and a flexible labour market is ultimately one of the reasons they choose Britain. It is, frankly, to be solved by a period of time after which such workers will be treated as employees in all respects. That period is currently up for negotiation. We are awaiting a lead from the European Commission, and for Brussels to come up with some ideas and thoughts to get this sorted once and for all. Members of the Committee will not find the Government against that, provided it does not eat into the flexibility at the constructive-quality end that helps not only those who make proper use of agency workers, but those in society who want to avail themselves of agency work for all the reasons I have mentioned.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC91"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000029"></a>The Government have undertaken a review of the current framework to cover all employment rights, determined by an individual&#146;s employment status, to see if that is still appropriate, whether those rights fit into the 21st century, whether they are fair and whether they can support our aim of getting a high participation in the workplace. We are looking specifically at the differing rights and responsibilities in employment law of &#147;employees&#148; and &#147;workers&#148;.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022519000030"></a>[<I>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 5.31 to 5.41 pm.</I>]</p>

<p><a name="08022525000001"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022525000016"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I remind the Committee that I was referring to the review that was undertaken. While undertaking that review, we found that temporary work such as agency work is greatly valued by employers and many individuals. I know that &#147;workers&#148; and &#147;agency workers&#148; are specific terms used in legislation and I use them accordingly. But other than that, I prefer to use words such as &#147;employees&#148;, &#147;self-employed&#148; or &#147;individuals&#148;; I see the word &#147;workers&#148; in the divisive way that I see such words as &#147;bosses&#148;, &#147;industry&#148; and &#147;sides&#148;.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000002"></a>We were given examples of abuse and lack of knowledge about existing rights but there was a lack of evidence that the appropriate response from government was a wholesale change of the current system. That was not going to be welcomed. Employers commented that extending all rights would be likely to result in a reduction in temporary work and that these lost jobs would not all be replaced by permanent ones. The overall conclusion of the review was that the existing framework met the UK&#146;s 21st-century labour market&#146;s needs and there was no need for further legislation in this area. The rationale behind the decision was published in our policy statement, <I>Success at Wor</I><I>k:</I><I></I><I>Protecting V</I><I>ulnerable </I><I>W</I><I>orkers, </I><I>Supporting G</I><I>ood </I><I>E</I><I>mployers</I>, in March 2006, just under two years ago.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000003"></a>This amendment implicitly aims to extend the current coverage of unfair dismissal rights to the wider category of &#147;worker&#148;. We looked at this issue in particular during the review and at the balance of rights and responsibilities. It would be unfair to employees in the workplace to give unfair dismissal rights to individuals who, unlike employees, do not have to give notice or more than short, limited notice if they wish to leave a job. Those on agency contracts working alongside employees enjoy benefits not available to employees, as employees enjoy benefits not available to agency workers. Flexibility is a two-way street.</p>
<h5><a name="08022525000015"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000004"></a>If this right were extended, employers would be likely to respond by requiring workers to give extended periods of notice, undermining the very flexibility that we know both employers and workers value; and the economy values that flexibility. That is why&#151;I repeat&#151;we have the most successful economy in Europe and the most flexible labour market. This would reopen issues that we carefully considered as part of the review.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC92"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000005"></a>The Government do not support the amendment, but we support the principle of equal treatment for agency workers. We consider that the best way forward to achieve that is for an agency workers&#146; commission in the United Kingdom, involving all interested parties from all sides of society in the workplace, to address that point and to devise a means of achieving equal treatment while preserving the flexibility that both sides want, and which preserves the flexibility of the UK labour market.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000006"></a>The Government take the protection of agency workers extremely seriously. That is why, for instance, last autumn we announced the doubling of employment agency inspectors. I would sincerely caution noble Lords to avoid damaging this very successful employment economy to attack&#151;rightly&#151;a small but damaging minority. We must protect those people. Please do not harm the rest of it to achieve your ends.</p>

<p><a name="08022525000007"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022525000017"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> I ask the Committee to remember that the words about abuse, the use of economic power and the like, and the need for legislative intervention were used not by me but by Mr Justice Elias, who has enormous experience of employment cases and who also made reference to flexibility in the labour market; and by Lord Justice Mummery, who pointed out, if it needs pointing out, the enormous explosion in the numbers of agencies where people go to get a job. Of course I understand the desire that the Minister mentioned of a woman with children getting into a job in this way, if there is no other way to get it, but I do not like the fact that she can be disposed of at will without any notice, and chucked out of her job because she has no employment rights.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000008"></a>Secondly, my noble friends know that I do not often pray in aid as a force the European Commission, but I do on this occasion. Its Green Paper on the future of labour law pointed out that there must be a balance to achieve what it calls, and what is now the new word in all the writing on the subject, &#147;flexicurity&#148;. It is not yet in the dictionary, but flexicurity, it explains, contains two things&#151;first, a flexible market that especially the employer will find extremely useful in the day-to-day and even long-term running of his business; and secondly, security for workers in regard to employment rights. The European Commission&#146;s whole Green Paper is based on that balance.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000009"></a>It is not very easy to achieve a balance. Sometimes in the debate today I felt that we were back in 1971, when people suggested to the Conservative Government, who wished to introduce it, that the right of unfair dismissal to be allowed to workers in employment tribunals would totally upset the labour market. Unfair dismissal has been with us a long time. Agency workers are entitled to that right as much as other workers with whom they work cheek by jowl at the workplace. The amendment is intended to promote that balance, first by new powers. The amendment takes the regulation route. Maybe that is wrong. My honourable friend&#146;s Bill in the other place may be a better way of moving the situation forward.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000010"></a>One thing is absolutely clear: we are in a moving situation. The Prime Minister&#146;s offer proves that we are not now static on agency workers. The unfairness  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the legal position for agency workers has been recognised by a number of judges and people who know more than I do about their status.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000011"></a>We aim for flexicurity, as the Green Paper suggests, and want a balance. Of course, I do not suggest that all employers act in an abusive manner towards either permanent or agency workers. As with the right to complain of an unfair dismissal, the amendment is intended to stop the minority of employers who abuse their power to dismiss. I can only say that anyone who reads the report of the debate of last Friday in the House of Commons and pays attention to what has been said will see that we are in a moving situation, whether the answer is a European directive or a new statute, as my honourable friend Mr Miller suggested in the Commons, or whether, as the amendment suggests, the Minister makes use of existing powers in the 1999 Act to improve the position of a substantial group of workers. That was the object of the amendment, and I hope that we can all agree, having read last Friday&#146;s debate and the terms of my suggestion, that we want flexicurity. We want a flexible labour market, but you cannot have one in the 21st century without giving agency workers basic rights which we have come to see as fairness at the place of work. I thank everyone who has spoken in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="08022525000012"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08022525000018"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn for making a plea for fairness in the workplace. We all want that. I hope that his knowledge of the law would be such that he will respect another law: that of unintended consequences.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000013"></a>France does not have the concept of agency workers in the same way at all. France has an enormously high rate of unemployment, and very low take-up of people coming into the workplace. Why? Because employers in a globalised economy vote with their feet. They go to places where they can avail themselves of a flexible labour market. Germany has high unemployment, and an even higher level of people who are not even entering the world of work for the first time. We excel in both those areas. One reason is that employers can avail themselves of agency temporary workers. The solution is a period when, at the start, an employer or someone wishing to avail themselves of agency temporary work can actually enjoy the same situation on both sides as exists today. But, after a period of continued work, the protection that my noble friends seek would click in. That would prevent so much of the abuse to which my noble friends so rightly draw the Committee&#146;s attention, while providing the flexibility, for a few months at a time, that so many employers need to compete in a globalised economy and our society needs to fulfil full employment.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022525000014"></a>We are trying to sort out what that period is with Brussels. I hope that the debate last week in the other place shed some light on it, and I am sure many Members of the Committee will have something to say about it. That is the solution. However, if you make it known and put agency workers in precisely the same position as those who are employed, you will suffer in a globalised economy because people will vote with their feet and go elsewhere. They will not create permanent posts to take those people&#146;s places;

That is not alarmist talk. We would much prefer to see clarity and have these abuses&#151;which are dreadful and happen all the time&#151;stopped for ever with well implemented regulation that is tough on people who cause distress to agency workers who are unprotected. That will happen after a period of time and is not for today.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000001"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022537000097"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> I take that to be a question&#151;I was in a semi-recumbent position&#151;but I agree with a lot of it. I think that my noble friend Lord Watson referred to parallel rights for agency workers. Slight differences may be desirable to stop this minority of employers abusing, as Mr Justice Elias said, their economic power over people who have no rights. When we introduced the notion of unfair dismissal to the Conservative Government, we did not say that all employers dismissed unfairly; we said that there were such cases and that workers should have a right to appeal against it.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000002"></a>I do not think that the Minister referred to the European Commission&#146;s Green Paper and the notion of flexicurity, which is now spattered throughout the literature of western Europe. I did not suggest that we should have the same law as France or Germany&#151;that would be absurd. It would be as absurd as Michael Gibbons&#146;s reference to adopting part of New Zealand law without going into the special circumstances that make it relevant to New Zealand.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000003"></a>I say that we should have a right to promote fairness in the workplace, and that moves us to discussions on agency workers, whether that is put to a royal commission or any other inquiry. In 10 years&#146; time, I do not believe that agency workers in Britain will be deprived by the law of rights that are equivalent to those of permanent workers, as they are today.

<p><a name="08022537000007"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I declare an interest as patron of Public Concern at Work, commonly known as the whistleblowers&#146; charity. This charity took the initiative in promoting the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which has its 10th anniversary this year. That Act encourages responsible whistleblowing by employees. It was introduced in the other place by Richard Shepherd, a Conservative Member of Parliament, and in this House by me. It protects employees who express concerns about wrongdoing that threatens the public interest and, in particular, it gives a remedy to a whistleblower who is sacked or otherwise disadvantaged in the workplace. It provides protection most readily where the concern is raised with the employer, but it also protects disclosures made to regulators and wider disclosures where they are justified and reasonable.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000008"></a>When the Act was passed 10 years ago, the legal position was that information about claims made under it would be on the public record. This was important because openness would help to discourage specious claims by employees and encourage employers to deal and cope properly with any significant public-interest risk raised with them.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000009"></a>However, in 2000, after the DTI lost a High Court case and the judge, Mr Justice Jackson, had confirmed that claims were properly on the public record, the DTI&#151;without consultation or announcement&#151;introduced temporary regulations during the parliamentary recess to reverse this legal position of the claims being on the public record. Later, more permanent regulations were made to remove all information about Public Interest Disclosure Act and other employment claims from the public record. I am afraid that the DTI&#151;I am so glad it is under different management now&#151;had a rather bad record there because, in 2005, the Parliamentary Ombudsman strongly criticised the DTI for its handling of the matter, finding that it had failed to consider the public interest, had repeatedly misled Public Concern at Work to avoid public criticism and had blocked parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000010"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to provide, from now on, open justice and transparency in proceedings under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. At present, no information about any whistleblowing claim brought under the Act is available on the public record unless the claim results in a tribunal hearing and judgment, in which case the decision is available for inspection by the public.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000011"></a>What do the employment tribunal statistics tell us? In 2005-06, 1,015 claims made under the Public Interest Disclosure Act were disposed of, but only 283 of them after a tribunal hearing. Information about those cases is on the record, but all the rest&#151;roughly  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>70 per cent of whistleblowing claims&#151;remain shrouded in secrecy. No information is available about the nature of the wrongdoing alleged, nor about who was at risk; depending on where the employment is, it might be consumers, patients in a hospital, taxpayers, shareholders or fellow employees. No information is available about who the concern was raised with, or the employer&#146;s response to the claim made by the employee whistleblower. Of course, no information is available about any alleged reprisal made by others, whether employees of some rank&#151;a manager or whatever&#151;or the employer himself.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000012"></a>One of the most serious consequences of this secrecy is that it enables and encourages an unscrupulous employer to buy off a genuine whistleblower and cover up any wrongdoing by the employer himself or his senior staff. An employer may settle the claim so as to avoid the case going to a hearing with the consequent publicity that, as I have already described, a hearing and judgment in the tribunal would entail.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000013"></a>Given that the Public Interest Disclosure Act expressly encourages employees to raise concerns about wrongdoing in the workplace internally so that responsible employers can deal with these concerns properly and without delay, the current secrecy surrounding the great majority of Public Interest Disclosure Act claims undermines the purposes of the Act. The present secrecy means that crime, company fraud, health and safety problems and tax evasions can be readily hushed up, contrary, I suggest, to the public interest.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000014"></a>Recent correspondence between Public Concern at Work, which briefed me on this matter, and Ministers, suggests that the Government may oppose my amendment on the basis that its outcome would be to &#147;name and shame&#148; employers on the basis of untested allegations. Your Lordships will notice from the wording of my amendment that it is clear that no allegation will go on the public record without the employer having the opportunity for his full and considered response to be made available at the same time.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000015"></a>The amendment introduces a strong presumption, but no more than that, that information about whistleblowing cases should no longer be kept secret. It creates a presumption, not an absolute or inflexible rule. New subsection (2) in the clause proposed in my amendment makes it subject to the statutory safeguards that exist for,</p>
<ul><a name="08022537000089"></a>&#147;cases involving national security, sexual misconduct and disability&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022537000060"></a>The presumption is also made, subject to a decision by a tribunal or the president of the employment tribunals, that if the publication of particular information in a case would be contrary to the public interest it must not be disclosed. Where the presumption operates, the information will be made available within 28 days of the conclusion of the case. The conclusion is defined in the amendment, in proposed new subsection (5); it includes where there has been a decision, a withdrawal or settlement of the claim, or where it has not been pursued for six months.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000016"></a>The information that will be made available will be the claim, the response, any further particulars and the decision, the notice of withdrawal or the settlement agreed between the parties. That will ensure that anyone obtaining the information can have a balanced rather than a one-sided picture of the whistleblowing case. The information will be made available electronically, by e-mail or on the internet, free of charge. That ensures that the amendment would satisfy the public interest in a way that incurs minimal administrative burden and negligible cost. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000017"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022537000099"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> I support the amendment. My noble friends and I have something of a track record on whistleblowing. Many will remember the appalling casualties in the Piper Alpha disaster some years ago. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn drafted a Bill, which I introduced as a Private Member&#146;s Bill; we got the Government to support it and the Bill became law, protecting whistleblowers who blew the whistle on unsafe practices in very dangerous circumstances. The Bill became part of a much wider health and safety Bill but the cover for whistleblowers still exists.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000018"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie has taken the matter further, beyond simply health and safety. However, in view of our interests in health and safety, I am particularly concerned that there appears to be no provision now for any information to be available. The object of the amendment, rightly, is to ensure that information becomes available, because unless it is available how will people know what happens as a result of whistleblowing, particularly in a health and safety situation? That is very important. I express my appreciation to my noble friend for introducing it. I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000019"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022537000100"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, does not do himself proud enough when he introduces this amendment. Ten years ago, when I chaired the National Consumer Council, a very brilliant young lawyer called Guy Dehn, who worked at the council, made this matter a real cause. It became his absolute passion. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, became chairman and has now moved on to being a patron. Therefore, my interest has been very involved with this, certainly from the consumer viewpoint in the 10 years that this body has been in existence. They have been 10 long years; it has been a long road, and it is remarkable that Guy Dehn&#151;brilliant as he is&#151;has stayed at the helm of this young organisation to try, almost single-handedly, to bring about some wonderful changes in this country.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000020"></a>Certainly, bringing things out into the light has been very important. I was lucky enough to be on the board of three public companies. In all three of them, I watched whistleblowing at work being introduced and I saw how different companies of different sizes were able to cope with it. It is therefore right that we should speak about it today.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, gave us a summary of a drawn-out process that one can without doubt call obscure. Whether whistleblower claims which are  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC98"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>settled before they reach a tribunal should be on the public record has been buried under a morass of regulations and inadequate consultation. What is worse, it appears that the then DTI undertook to hide the regulations and their overall intention from the charity, Public Concern at Work. As the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, pointed out, the ombudsman&#146;s report was damning about the way in which the Government handled the regulations. I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether the Government have any intention of revisiting the matter and, this time, adopting an open and transparent approach to the problem. The Government appear to have buried their heads in the sand about the strength of feeling on this matter. I hope that they will be responsible enough to take the proper steps to address the concern so well expressed by one of their own noble friends.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000022"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022537000101"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> Amendment No. 22 seeks publication of the papers in tribunal claims which have been determined, withdrawn or settled and include a claim under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. I understand that the intention of the amendment is to expose publicly employers who are alleged to have sought to cover up dangerous or unlawful activity. The Government recognise concern about the issue, and we support action by the appropriate authorities to stamp it out and exposure where proven&#151;I repeat, where proven.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000023"></a>However, we are concerned about the practical impact of the amendment. In cases that reach the stage of a tribunal hearing, the evidence is of course put into the public domain of the hearing&#151;almost all tribunal hearings are in public. However, in cases that do not reach a hearing, such as those that are withdrawn or settled beforehand, the Government would be concerned about publication of the papers. There would have been no investigation of the alleged wrongdoing to test the facts. The Tribunals Service would be publishing material that might include unsubstantiated allegations to which, depending on the stage of proceedings reached, the respondent might not have had the opportunity to respond. I have heard much about fairness from noble Lords today, and that would be inherently unfair. Publication of that material would not be a proportionate response in those circumstances. It is arguable that to publish might be counter to the Data Protection Act; it could also be a breach of confidence or of copyright. I am sure that those people whose writing can be misleading, but factually accurate, would consider it open season.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000024"></a>Furthermore, in cases that have been withdrawn or settled, not only are the employer&#146;s details still confidential but so are those of the claimant. The claimant has every right to expect them to remain confidential. We can speculate that the claimant may have been bought off, but, equally, the detriment he claimed may have been reversed or ameliorated through conciliation. None of that would work if all his details were to become a matter of public record precisely at the moment that he settled. PIDA claims are not about the working practices underlying the claim; they are about the detriment, actual or potential, suffered by the claimant. Revealing the  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC99"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>claimant&#146;s details may lead to the employer feeling betrayed by an employee with whom he has reached an amicable agreement, and there is a risk of further detriment. That is in no one&#146;s interests.</p>
<h5><a name="08022537000095"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000025"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie discussed information that is no longer on the public register. Employer and claimant details were on the public register before 2004. Information relating to employment tribunal claimants and respondents was put on the public register prior to the introduction of the current employment tribunal rules in 2004. However, it became clear that that was encouraging ambulance chasers and reducing the chances of the parties achieving a conciliated settlement. &#147;Publish and be damned&#148; comes to mind. Therefore, confirmed by a public consultation, it was decided to preserve the confidentiality of the parties and to publish details of judgments only. That policy was supported by the key stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000026"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie also referred to the appeal made to the Parliamentary Ombudsman on behalf of the charity Public Concern at Work concerning access to the details of respondents to PIDA claims and the findings of the ombudsman&#146;s report. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, also referred to that. The Government accept the findings of the report, which recognised that there was no intention to deceive. The Government fully accept that action may be needed to prevent the undesirable practices that an employee may attempt to expose, leading in turn to his suffering detriment and to a Public Interest Disclosure Act claim. Both the CBI and the EEF have told us that they oppose this amendment for reasons similar to those that I have just set out, but they have asked us to stress that they of course support rooting out employers who engage in dangerous, fraudulent or abusive behaviour.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000027"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Borrie, who, in explaining his amendment, said that it should be read in the context of a statement of settlement, or similar, being added to the paper published. I am grateful for that clarification of the purpose of the amendment, but I am afraid that I am not persuaded that such a procedure would be workable or overcome the difficulties with the amendment. There would still be no court finding on the substance of the employer&#146;s alleged behaviour against which to test the statement. It would be making public an allegation, not a proven fact. The certificate could still reflect a cover-up between the employer and the claimant who, for whatever reason, had settled directly. Furthermore, there is no mechanism to ensure that the parties would agree to put their statement into the public domain, nor that they would be able to agree its terms.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000028"></a>I know that my noble friend recently discussed this matter with my right honourable friends the Minister of State for Employment Relations and the Member for Makerfield. In his subsequent letter, the Minister of State said that he believed the amendment would impact adversely on the innocent and that there was no evidence that it would increase our ability to tackle bad employers. I therefore ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC100"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

That comes from extremely long experience of trade union work and work in this House on employment matters. I am also grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, for her praise of the director of Public Concern at Work, who has been, as she rightly said, there since the beginning, 10 years ago, and has done distinguished work on behalf of employers and employees in securing some sort of remedy for those who suffer through giving information to the proper authorities about wrong-doing in the workplace.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000030"></a>I am bound to say that I am disappointed by the Minister&#146;s response. He expressed concern about publication of the claim, the response and the settlement and so on if there was no hearing. He either did not mention or did not stress my point that the employer&#146;s case would also be on the record. I have no doubt that, if my amendment were accepted, employers, no doubt seeking the best legal advice in the circumstances&#151;perhaps more than they do at the moment&#151;would ensure that their response and the wording of any settlement and so on did justice to their case. The idea that the record will merely show unproven allegations seems to me to be incorrect.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000031"></a>I also have to say that I feel that the Minister rather ignored the evils of secrecy that currently exist. I mention that in mid-January the <I>Financial Times</I> carried a report that the former head of Cantor Fitzgerald&#146;s spread-betting unit was bringing a claim under the Public Interest Disclosure Act alleging that he had been dismissed following raising concerns about legal and financial irregularities in the firm. A week later the <I>Financial Times</I> reported that the dispute had been settled for &#163;15 million and that the employee had withdrawn his allegations. I do not know whether there was a serious matter costing punters and taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds or whether it was some insignificant matter that the employee had blown up out of all proportion in order to leverage the maximum compensation he could get. In other words, I have no idea what lay behind that, nor does the general public, and nor do regulators interested in financial matters in the City, yet there may be a very strong public interest reason that they should know.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000032"></a>In the light of the Minister&#146;s response, of course I will discuss matters with my advisers. He rightly says that I have had the benefit of discussions with the Minister for Employment, Mr Pat McFadden, who sits in another place. In the past I have had the benefit of discussions, and I have seen pronouncements on the subject by previous Ministers. In 2004, not so very long ago when employment tribunal regulations came before this Chamber, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, indicated that he was in favour of open justice. Similar words were used by Mr Gerry Sutcliffe, the noble Lord&#146;s opposite number in the other place. Now the curtain of secrecy has come down again, and it will be a very serious matter if one cannot get over that, especially, I may note, when, in the High Court, Civil Procedure Rules enable non-parties, outsiders, to get access to the claims and the defences raised, which seems a better possibility than this almost absolute secrecy.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000034"></a>There may be many reasons why matters come to an end in secrecy before a hearing, but those reasons do not necessarily imply guilt. My noble friend Lord Borrie says that employers could perhaps pay even more money and wrap themselves up for even more time by using even more expensive lawyers to provide them with advice at that stage. That practical advice may be to settle, the only coercion being the threat of publicity. It is naive to believe that publication would provide fairness to both sides.</p>

No doubt the Minister will be able to assist me, after some 12 years, and remind me further about that section when he responds. A full response would be useful so that my noble friend Lady Gardner can decide what to do on Report. As my noble friend Lady Perry has put the matter, she is not totally wedded to the word &#147;frivolous&#148; but feels that there is a case for some strengthening of the words of the 1996 Act by adding something after &#147;vexatious&#148; and certainly adding something after the word &#147;persistently&#148;. She has come up with the words &#147;frivolous&#148; and &#147;frivolously&#148;. The Government may have a better suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000042"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08022537000107"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> I said on a previous amendment that we have all heard of cases which get through the net of conciliation, when the tribunal has power to strike them out. However, there is no evidence at all, from any survey, that those cases are numerous. Section 33 of the Employment Tribunals Act gives the tribunal or the chairman power to strike out a claim that is vexatious or unreasonable. The regulations that I quoted under a previous amendment add to that, but at the moment I have lost my note of them. The right of the tribunal and the chairman to strike out claims that are vexatious, scandalous or unreasonable or are being pursued in a manner which is vexatious or unreasonable is made very clear in the 2004 regulations. The only work that has been done on this suggests that there are very few of those because cases are not often struck out.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000043"></a>I do not see how the word &#147;frivolous&#148; would add anything to the present law. If the noble Baroness wants the word, she can have it as far as I am concerned, but I do not believe that it will make any practical difference for those practising in the employment tribunal world.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000044"></a>It is very important that vexatious, unreasonable or frivolous actions should not waste the time of an employment tribunal. There are plenty of powers to get rid of them as the employment regulations of 2004 stand and as the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 stands. I do not see that this amendment would add anything in practice, although I have yet to discuss this with people who practise day-in and day-out before employment tribunals.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000045"></a>I declare as an interest the chambers in which I used to be an active member but am now a retired member. It contains many members of the Bar who practise in tribunals, and I have never heard from any of them that there are a lot of frivolous claims that get past the checks and waste the time of the tribunals. If there is such research, it should be produced on Report, but those practitioners would say, &#147;You can have the word if you want to, but it won&#146;t make a jot of difference&#148;.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000047"></a>The Government are committed to creating an environment in which employers and employees make genuine attempts to resolve their workplace disputes without recourse to the employment tribunal. When such disputes go on to become employment tribunal claims, it is important that measures are in place to ensure that claims are made responsibly and discourage those which seek only to inconvenience or harass a party or to bring the system into disrepute for selfish reasons. The Government believe that only a very small proportion of tribunal claims fall into the latter category, and they are dealt with, as appropriate, by the tribunal system.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000048"></a>The amendment seeks to include within Section 33 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 restrictions on frivolously instituted vexatious proceedings. Section 33 contains provisions for restrictions on habitually and persistently made vexatious proceedings. The Government recognise that a distinction can be drawn in certain circumstances between habitual and persistent, and frivolous, vexatious proceedings, and believe that it makes sense to treat them differently in the law.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000049"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn raised the point about research, and I would welcome some work being done in future on how many frivolous claims are settled at the beginning of the whole process so they do not feature in current research. Employers buy them off&#151;especially small businesses, which write a cheque to avoid being wrapped up in the mire of litigation. A frivolously started claim might not find its way into the statistics because the cheque is written completely unfairly to get rid of something that will cost the business a great deal. That is an abuse of the process but one that does not feature on the radar of survey work of what tribunals actually hear.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000050"></a>I can provide the assurance to the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, that the provisions are sufficient to cover the point that she rightly raised. The powers contained in Section 33 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 are appropriate for dealing with a course of conduct that could include repeated frivolous claims, whereas a frivolous case in the terms of this amendment could be a one-off claim, although it would still have to be a vexatious one. It is based on the provisions of Section 42 of the Supreme Court Act 1981, which also draws this distinction.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000051"></a>The powers available under this provision enable the appeal tribunal, when there has been habitual and persistent institution of vexatious proceedings without reasonable grounds, to make a restriction of proceedings order which includes that no proceedings shall without leave of the appeal tribunal be instituted in any employment tribunal or before the appeal tribunal by the person against whom the order is made; any proceedings instituted by that person in any employment tribunal or before the appeal tribunal before the making of the order shall not be continued by him without the

That is evidence of the assurance the noble Baroness sought.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000052"></a>Other powers are available to tribunals in respect of weak cases. The Government suggest that if frivolous cases are weak, they can be considered under those powers. They include striking out, cost orders, pre-hearing reviews and a requirement for payments of deposits. The law already safeguards access to justice, while giving employment tribunals appropriate mechanisms for dealing with weak cases.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000053"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022537000109"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> I put on record that I referred to the regulations of 2004: Regulation 18(7)(b) and (c). I shall not detain the Committee longer on that.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000054"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022537000110"></a>Baroness Perry of Southwark:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the reassurance which my noble friend was seeking, and I thank my noble friend Lord Henley for his supportive and helpful remarks. I listened with great interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said based on his practical experience of these cases. My sample population of one&#151;my daughter, who is an employment law barrister&#151;tells me of many cases that I, as a lay person, would regard as frivolous, but perhaps she only tells me about the interesting, frivolous ones that keep me amused. I note the Minister frequently coupled the word &#147;frivolous&#148; with the word &#147;vexatious&#148;. There is a distinction between the two. People can be frivolous but not desperately vexatious or vice versa. My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes is attempting to pick up the category of frivolity. I am reassured by what the Minister said. My noble friend will be able to read in <I>Hansard</I> his reply and the comments of other noble Lords. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000056"></a>Clause 7 agreed to.</p>

<p><a name="08022537000057"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022537000111"></a>Lord Wedderburn of Charlton</b> moved Amendment No. 24:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022537000081"></a> After Clause 7, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022537000085"></a>The Secretary of State shall by order make regulations providing for the direct recovery by a claimant of an award of compensation made by an employment tribunal within three months of the decision, and for interest to be payable on amounts paid later than that date.&#148;&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000058"></a>The noble Lord said: In support of this amendment I have to rely on those who have done a great deal of work in relation to employment tribunal awards of compensation that are not paid. Citizens Advice has produced a report on what it calls &#147;rogue employers&#148; who are, of course, a minority. It states:</p>
<ul><a name="08022537000090"></a>&#147;we believe that these provisions&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08022537000061"></a>that is those of the 2007 Act, which has improved the position with regard to application to the county court&#151;</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="08022537000091"></a>&#147;do not go anywhere near far enough. For it is the common experience of CAB advisers that registration of an unpaid award in the County Court&#151;which under the provisions of the 2007 Act is to become automatic and free of charge&#151;frequently fails to secure payment as the associated consequences for the employer of continued non-compliance are negligible ... Furthermore, these provisions of the 2007 Act&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08022537000062"></a>which I have already said improve the position,</p>
<ul><a name="08022537000092"></a>&#147;have not yet been implemented, and the Government has not yet given any indication of when they will be. A Ministry of Justice consultation document on implementation of Part 1 of the 2007 Act, published on 28 November 2007, simply states that &#145;some detailed work remains to be done on this so that the new provisions work seamlessly between Acas, the tribunals, the county courts and enforcement agencies&#146;. We suspect and fear that this work is no longer a priority for the Tribunals Service and Ministry of Justice.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022537000086"></a>Accordingly, for the time being successful tribunal claimants who have not received their award still need to pay to register the unpaid award in the County Court before they can begin enforcement action, and those who have not received a COT3&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022537000063"></a>the form for payment&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08022537000093"></a>&#147;settlement cannot enforce the settlement through the County Court (as the 2007 Act provides for) ... the survey of CAB advisers we conducted for our March 2005 report <I>Hollow victories</I> suggested that, each year, the 430 Citizens Advice Bureaux in England and Wales alone deal with some 650 unpaid employment tribunal awards, which is one in 20 of the some 13,000 awards made by the tribunals each year. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to conclude that the total number of unpaid awards is in the region of 1,000 per year&#151;or one in 13 of all awards.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022537000087"></a>Citizens Advice believes that this is a significant proportion of all tribunal awards, and we would suggest that such a degree of non-compliance seriously undermines the credibility of both the employment tribunal system as a whole, and the very welcome reforms of that system set out in the current Employment Bill. Furthermore, we would suggest that such non-compliance tends to impact disproportionately on the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers, who are over represented in the caseload of Citizens Advice Bureaux and who are, increasingly, a main focus of the Government&#146;s wider policy on employment relations (see page 8 of our December 2007 report <I>Rooting out the rogues</I>).</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022537000088"></a>Indeed, however &#145;small&#146; the total number of unpaid awards ... the impact on individual claimants is substantial, and can be devastating&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022537000059"></a>Citizens Advice&#146;s document sets out the devastating consequences. It is not easy for a worker who has obtained an award of compensation in a tribunal to get it enforced. The thrust of the paper is that the Government should set up some automatic machinery by means of a new body that will see to it that compensation awards are paid. It may be that this amendment is not exactly drafted in the terms that Citizen Advice, which is daily concerned with people who just cannot go on trying to enforce their compensation awards, would suggest. Its thrust is to ask the Government to see that even after the reform of county court enforcement under paragraph 43 of Schedule 8 to the 2007 Act a new departure is needed. We suggest it should be direct recovery by the claimant of compensation awarded by the employment tribunal, certainly within three months&#151;that is unduly modest&#151;and for interest to be payable on amounts paid later than that date. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08022541000002"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08022541000058"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn. He is entirely right that it raises concerns on which the citizens advice  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC106"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bureaux have strongly lobbied us. A number of us, including myself, mentioned it at Second Reading. Whether this is the best way of dealing with it is obviously a matter for the Government. I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, will have any pride in his drafting.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000003"></a>The problem is a straightforward one. Very often, according to Citizens Advice, individuals&#151;usually at the bottom of the employment heap, as it were&#151;get a judgment and, when a rogue employer does not pay it, they are faced with the problem of going through the normal judicial procedure of going to court to get it enforced. They quite often face the risk of putting down money that they do not actually have for court fees. There is wide concern across all sides of your Lordships&#146; House that the Government should take the opportunity to deal with this, so that employees who get an order have the ability to enforce it without putting further sums of money at risk against rogue employers. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, has brought this up and am happy to support it.</p>

<p><a name="08022541000004"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022541000059"></a>Lord Watson of Invergowrie:</b> I support the amendment. It is important to draw parallels between the clauses in the Bill, which make provision for payment in full of the national minimum wage where employers are not up to the mark on that, and the amendment. I referred to the Minister&#146;s remarks at Second Reading, where he commented on what he termed a small minority of employers who do not meet their obligations under the national minimum wage. He quoted figures, such as the &#163;3 million paid in compensation as a result of government action on that.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000005"></a>The situation is similar with employment tribunal awards. Like other Members of the Committee, I commend Citizens Advice for what it has done on this and the resources and information it has provided. A figure that sticks in my mind is that up to one in 20 awards at employment tribunals are simply not paid. In many cases, the individual who has been successful at the tribunal is faced with having to win again, but  is unable to provide the time, resources or determination. He or she may be worn down, and is probably no longer in employment anyway&#151;or not with that employer. It may not be pursued for a number of reasons and it seems strange, to put it no stronger, that Clause 7 provides for additional compensation to be made for financial loss and also for unlawful deduction of wages or non-payment of redundancy payments, over and above the basic tribunal award. I ask the Minister what happens if those payments are themselves not then made. What recourse does an individual have? He or she must go back and spend a basic minimum of something like &#163;500 just to get the matter into court. That can be a daunting prospect, particularly for somebody who  is not in work as a result of a dispute with an employer.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000006"></a>There would be consistency, should the Government accept this amendment, so that non-payment of tribunal awards and other awards consequent on the action of the employer should be recoverable in the same way as non-payment of the  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC107"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>national minimum wage. I therefore hope that the Minister can give a positive response when he replies to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="08022541000007"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08022541000060"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I thank my noble friend Lord Wedderburn for raising the issue. We know that the number of unpaid awards is a real issue. A problem has been that we have never yet seen robust evidence for the figure of one in 20, and would very much like to see those figures. However, we absolutely accept that the issue needs to be examined. Indeed, as I speak, the Government are commissioning research to do just that.</p>

<p><a name="08022541000008"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08022541000061"></a>Lord Watson of Invergowrie:</b> If the Minister and his officials have not already done so, might they meet Citizens Advice, which has considerable information that it could put at their disposal?</p>

<p><a name="08022541000009"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08022541000062"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend, but he will not be surprised to hear that my officials have already met Citizens Advice, for which I have the highest regard having been a chairman of a small citizens advice bureau some years ago. But my noble friend is perhaps suggesting that there should be another meeting. The Government are attempting to have research done on what is undoubtedly a very important matter. We are talking about orders, and they should be paid.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000010"></a>Some callers to ACAS refer to unpaid awards, but there is no systematic recording of that information. Some of them may still be within the generous 42 days permitted for payment. There is no hard evidence&#151;I wish there were. Anything that Citizens Advice or anybody else can do to provide that hard evidence would be very much appreciated.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000011"></a>The amendment would do three things. First, it would allow awards to be enforced without the need for a county court order. Secondly, it would extend the period after which enforcement of awards could be initiated to three months&#151;three months slightly surprises us, given that the current period is 42 days, which is less than half three months. Thirdly, it would make interest payable on awards which remain unpaid after that period; that is, three months.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000012"></a>As the law stands, and as the Committee will know well, employment tribunal awards should be paid within 42 days of the judgment, unless the respondent chooses to appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Unpaid awards may then be enforced in the same way as county court judgments; that is, by means of a court order. Most awards are also subject to interest after the 42 days have elapsed, except in the special case of discrimination and equal pay claims, where interest accrues from the date of decision and where the tribunal has a discretion to award interest on any award for injury to feelings from the date of the Act which gave rise to the complaint.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000013"></a>As my noble friend said in moving the amendment, Section 27 of and paragraph 43 of Schedule 8 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 will enable tribunal awards, including employment tribunal awards, to be enforced as if they were payable  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under a county court order; that is, the claimant can, for example, go straight to the bailiffs for enforcement. The 2007 Act also contains parallel measures, in Section 142, which will enable a legally binding agreement brokered by ACAS to be enforced in precisely the same way.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000014"></a>Additional provisions in Schedule 8 to the Act will enable unpaid awards to be included on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines. Inclusion on that register, which is often consulted by banks, building societies and credit companies when considering applications for credit, can make it more difficult for defaulters to obtain credit, and will provide an incentive to pay promptly.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000015"></a>Responsibility for implementing these provisions, which are now an Act of Parliament, lie with the Ministry of Justice, which intends to implement them in April 2009, alongside the repeal of the statutory dispute procedures under the current Bill. Practical work is to be done to put in place the necessary administrative measures between the courts and the employment tribunals, and to ensure that good information is available to claimants. The provisions apply to any sum payable, including any award of costs as well as awards owing to successful claimants.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000016"></a>It appears that the proposal to extend the period after which enforcement could be initiated to three months would have the effect of providing additional time for respondents to pay. An award must currently be paid within 42 days, unless an appeal to the EAT is lodged. I do not think that may Members of this Committee, nor those who support the amendment, would welcome this change. We are somewhat surprised that it should be part of such an amendment.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000017"></a>Again, with regard to the payment of interest, it appears that the amendment would increase the time period before interest was charged on awards, which in most cases is currently 42 days from the date of judgment. The Committee will not be surprised to hear that the Government have no wish to increase that period, and I am sure that it is not noble Lords&#146; intention to do so. However, the measures that I have already described to streamline the enforcement process are designed to encourage early payment to the benefit of claimants.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000018"></a>We are also providing help to vulnerable claimants through Clause 7 of the current Bill. Clause 7 gives tribunals the discretion to make additional awards against respondents to cover the full financial loss arising from money not paid to, or unlawfully withheld from, the claimant in claims for unlawful deductions and unpaid redundancy awards. This will extend an existing power in relation to unpaid holiday pay under the Working Time Regulations to these further jurisdictions and mean that claimants will not have to apply to the courts for awards compensating for consequential losses.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000019"></a>In addition to the provisions in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act, I should also refer to the fact that the Government are commissioning research on the payment and enforcement of awards to inform future procedures. Therefore, not only are we looking at the number of those who are paid but  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC109"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we are also commissioning research on the payment and enforcement of awards to inform future procedures. I hope that that is of interest and is approved of by the Committee.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000020"></a>We share the concern raised in this debate that enforcement of awards is not just important but vital, and we are already taking action. Perhaps the action will not be quite as quick as those who support the amendment would like, but it is coming. I hope that there is a degree of reassurance in what I have had to say so that my noble friend can withdraw his amendment.</p>

When I saw it in print, I realised that there was something terribly wrong with the drafting: to have put three months instead of 42 days was ridiculous. The Minister has done a great job in destroying the drafting of the amendment, so all I can do is rely on its spirit.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000022"></a>First, I am very glad to hear that the Government are doing further research. When they do it, perhaps I may ask them to pay heed to what Citizens Advice has come up with, because it is not talking without evidence; it is talking about citizens advice bureaux throughout the country. One passage that I read, which, alas, I have sent to <I>Hansard</I>, spoke of the citizens advice bureaux throughout England and Wales finding that this is a terrible problem. Unpaid awards by what Citizens Advice calls &#147;rogue employers&#148; is certainly something that we must deal with. Therefore, the spirit of my amendment, which we will look at again on Report from the root upwards, is that we welcome the Government&#146;s further research, just as we welcomed paragraph 43 of Schedule 8 to the 2007 Act, and we hope that the question of unpaid awards can be addressed directly out of that research and that some improvement can be made in the very near future. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08022541000026"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment among a clutch of probing amendments, and it is intended to draw attention to a retrospective calculation that the Government intend to use to calculate the remuneration that an employer will have to pay if it transpires that he is paying less than the minimum wage. Retrospective provisions are generally considered as something that should be avoided at all costs. The idea of incurring a new or heavier punishment for an activity that at the time of occurrence did not result in such a penalty is a breach of one of the most fundamental principles of law. Yet in the Bill, if I am reading it correctly, we see that arrears that have been built up before the new provisions are implemented will be subject to the new  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>formula for calculating arrears, not the old one, if the new one will result in a higher total. This would seem to result in a situation where an employer who is served an enforcement notice immediately after the provisions have been enacted would be forced to pay considerably more in arrears than an employer who had been underpaying by the same amount over the same period of time but who was served the day before. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me that that is not the case. It is possible that I have misunderstood the legislation. I cannot work out whether the retrospectivity will apply just to a tax year that overlaps when the provisions are implemented or to the whole period of the underpayment. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to clarify that for me. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08022541000027"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0006.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="08022541000065"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness who has started our&#151;brief, I hope&#151;discussion of the national minimum wage clauses in the Bill. They are important clauses. Clause 8 provides a new, fairer method of calculating the amount of arrears of national minimum wage due to a worker. It provides that the arrears will be calculated in relation to the national minimum wage rate in force on the date they are repaid as opposed to the rate in force when the work was done. That goes some way to making good the loss of earning power the worker suffered by remaining underpaid over the period he was without his national minimum wage payment.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000028"></a>Amendment No. 24A, tabled in the name of the noble Baroness, removes subsection (8) of Clause 8, which provides that the new method of calculating arrears will apply to all arrears owed to underpaid workers when the provision comes into force. It would prevent the new method of calculating arrears contained in Clause 8 being used to help workers underpaid before commencement.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80225-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000029"></a>We recognise that applying certain sanctions to employers for non-compliance before commencement has the potential to cause unfairness. That is why we have not taken that approach with the rest of the changes to the national minimum wage regime. For example, the penalty contained in the new notice of underpayment in Clause 9 will not apply to an underpayment of national minimum wage before commencement. However, we considered long and carefully whether the provisions in Clause 8 should apply retrospectively and we concluded that, in this case, it is right because the aim of Clause 8 is not to penalise employers; rather, it is to ensure the fairest outcome for workers who have been underpaid. Amendment No. 24A would deny underpaid workers arrears calculated under the new method until some considerable time after Clause 8 comes into effect. Moreover, it would have no impact on outstanding arrears, which could go back as far as six years. If someone had been underpaid for six years, it is surely right that there should be some allowance for the increase in the cost of living since the underpayments began.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000030"></a>If Clause 8 were to come into force on 1 October 2008, at the same time as the annual uprating of the national minimum wage, the amendment would  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mean that a worker who was underpaid after commencement&#151;that is, from 1 October 2008&#151;would not receive any additional remuneration until at least 1 October 2009. Under current legislation and under Clause 9, a notice of underpayment may include a pay reference period ending up to six years before the date of service of the notice. Under the amendment, a worker whose employer had failed to pay outstanding arrears for several years before commencement would not be entitled to any uplift to take account of the years that he was without the money.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000031"></a>A further effect of Amendment No. 24A would be to increase the complexity of the calculation of arrears for employers and workers, as there would be two arrears regimes in force at the same time. We do not think that that is right.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000032"></a>We recognise that the effect of subsection (8) would be to impose an additional burden for employers in those cases where the underpayment has been significant or has gone on for a period of time. However, this burden will apply only to those employers who have failed to make good the arrears owed to their underpaid workers by commencement. Employers would have to pay an additional amount as remuneration only if the arrears are repaid in a different national minimum wage rate year from the one in which the underpayment occurred.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000033"></a>On the other hand&#151;and this is significant&#151;it is open to employers, aware of the proposed changes to the law, to repay arrears in accordance with the current law until Clause 8 comes into force. If an employer repays his workers and becomes compliant with the NMW legislation at any time before commencement, he will remain unaffected by Clause 8.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000034"></a>We will do our best to ensure that employers are aware of the changes that the Bill will bring in to the national minimum wage regime well before they come into effect. We are currently working with stakeholders to develop guidance to ensure that everyone is fully aware of the changes the new legislation will bring, and what they need to do to be compliant well before those changes come into effect.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000035"></a>In short, we do not believe that it is unfair that the provisions in Clause 8 are retrospective. The employer has a responsibility to pay the correct amount of pay at the correct time. The changes contained in Clause 8 will have an effect only on employers who are non-compliant with the national minimum wage.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000036"></a>Workers paid below the national minimum wage are likely to suffer financial hardship even if arrears are eventually paid, if no account is taken of the effect of the underpayment in real terms. It is right that the repayment of arrears to a worker should take account of the length of time the arrears have been outstanding. Our fear is that if Amendment No. 24A were carried, it would bite hardest on those workers whose arrears have been outstanding for a longer period&#151;that is, frankly, those who have been treated the worst by their employers. For those reasons&#151;and I hope that I have not gone on at too much length&#151;we believe that what is in the Bill is the right

The good news is that I have not misunderstood the legislation. I began to think that maybe it was just me and that I was going to stand up and be made to look silly.

<p><a name="08022541000044"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022541000067"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> I am probing just to allow the Minister the opportunity to defend the necessity of giving these powers to the compliance officers. Clause 10 gives civil enforcement officers new powers to take materials away to copy relevant documents. It is, as I am sure the Minister will say, a relatively small power to give them, especially in comparison to those awarded in Clause 12, which I will come to later. Even small increases need to be justified. Can the Minister give us any evidence that the lack of these powers have prevented compliance officers issuing an enforcement notice, or is this just another example of the Government tweaking the employment law?</p>

<p><a name="08022541000045"></a><b><a name="80225-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022541000068"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I shall do my best to explain Clause 10. The Government are determined to ensure full, effective enforcement of the national minimum wage legislation that we have passed&#151;and I know that the Committee would want such enforcement. At present, officers who enforce the national minimum wage have the power only to require the production of records, to inspect them and copy them at the employer&#146;s premises. In the majority of cases, these powers are sufficient. In the event that compliance officers are unable to copy the material at the employer&#146;s premises&#151;for example, if photocopying equipment is not available or there is too much information to copy in the time available&#151;employers often allow officers to take the material away to copy it. However, when  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>25 Feb 2008 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an employer does not agree to the removal of national minimum wage records, officers do not have the right to remove these records to allow them to make copies. We have therefore concluded that the efficiency of national minimum wage enforcement would be increased if HMRC had the power to remove national minimum wage records from the employer&#146;s premises for a reasonable time to allow them to take copies. Subsection (3) of Clause 10 provides for this.</p>

<a name="80225-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022541000046"></a>It is important for both employers and workers that records are handled properly when taken away from an employer&#146;s premises. Compliance officers have to act in accordance with strict rules to safeguard records on HMRC premises, and consideration is being given to whether there is a need to strengthen these rules. The power to copy information in Section 14(1) of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 currently allows officers to copy &#147;any material part&#148; of the records. Subsection (2) of Clause 10&#151;</p>

The power to copy information in Section 14(1) of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 allows officers to copy &#147;any material part&#148; of the records. Clause 10(2) amends this power to enable an officer to copy a complete record, rather than have to sift through at the initial stages of the investigation to determine what he believes will be the material part of it. We do not believe that it is right that officers who are enforcing the minimum wage should have to rely on the good will of the employer to allow records to be removed or be required to copy records at the employer&#146;s premises. We consider that the modest changes&#151;and they are modest&#151;proposed in this clause will make the information-gathering process by HMRC more effective.</p>

Is it possible when we meet again for him to give us evidence that the lack of these powers have prevented compliance officers issuing an enforcement notice? Is it driven because of that problem? If it is a matter merely of making things more convenient, I am not sure that we should be making a law for it&#151;for the Executive to be happier and more comfortable and not have to &#147;sit through&#148;. Those seem to me to be the wrong words, framing up more powers being given to enforcement officers simply so they are not uncomfortable.</p>

If there is no copier there they cannot copy anything. If a great deal of information is needed and they do not have the time to do it&#151;because presumably the employer would have to stay much later than otherwise and the officers would not have the time anyway&#151;it is a matter of convenience so that enforcement action can be taken. What the noble Baroness should not forget is that there are, I am afraid, a very small minority of employers who will do everything that they possibly can to obstruct being found out that they have not paid the national minimum wage. I do not think that anyone could argue that what is being proposed in Clause 10 is a great attack on civil liberties or a great increase in executive power.</p>

I cannot see all this about having to go along to someone&#146;s premises, and whether it is inconvenient and you have too many bits of paper to work on. Also, hard cases make bad law. The odd one or two are badly behaved but, having worked in and run small businesses and known how much intrusion there can be when people turn up and start accusing you of things, I know that it can be very upsetting. And this is just for the convenience of someone being able to take a photocopy? I ask the Minister to bring me evidence that the lack of the powers has prevented compliance officers issuing an enforcement notice. I do not think that that is too much to ask; I am sure it is not beyond the ability of this wonderful Executive to provide. For the moment, of course, I will withdraw the amendment, as I have to in the Moses Room. Oh!

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0802256000008"></a>In December last year I updated Parliament on the Government's review of the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody as one aspect of its continued commitment to bring about real changes and improvements to reduce deaths of people being held in our custodial care (<I>Official Report</I>, 13 December, col. 65WS). The review was being conducted by Robert Fulton, a former Home Office director. I am pleased to inform the House that Ministers have now received his report and I am making it available today.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0802256000009"></a>Mr Fulton has recommended significant changes to the existing arrangements. An advisory panel on deaths in custody, formed of experts in the subject-matter from outside government departments and operational services, would become the principal source of advice to a ministerial board on deaths in custody. The advisory panel would be supported by a broadly-based practitioner and stakeholder group comparable to the existing forum. The board, replacing the ministerial round-table on suicide, would bring together decision-makers responsible for deaths in custody issues in the Ministry of Justice, Home Office and Department of Health.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0802256000010"></a>The Government welcome this report and will be giving it careful consideration, taking into account the views of forum and round-table members and others in and out of Parliament with an interest in death in custody issues. In making final decisions, Ministers will be considering such factors as the likelihood of the proposed structural changes delivering effective reductions in deaths in custody and cost.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0802256000015"></a>The item on the internal energy market will focus on the Commission&#146;s third package of proposed legislation to improve the functioning of the internal market in electricity and gas. This comprises proposals to amend the existing directives on common rules for the internal electricity and natural gas markets and the existing regulations on conditions for access to gas and electricity networks. These include proposals to strengthen the powers and independence of national regulators and increase market transparency. There is also a proposal to establish an agency to facilitate the co-operation between national energy regulators. The debate at the council is likely to focus on ownership unbundling and the proposed agency. The UK has welcomed the Commission&#146;s proposals as crucial for creating a properly functioning EU energy market but will be pressing for a stronger regulatory agency.</p>

<a name="0802256000019"></a><b><a name="80225-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="0802256000042"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning (Caroline Flint) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0802256000020"></a>Today the Government have launched<I> Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I>, a national strategy for housing an ageing society.  This strategy addresses the challenge of ageing, and what it means for housing and planning in England.  </p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0802256000021"></a>In our Green Paper<I> Homes for the Future</I> we announced our vision for housing and an ambition to build 3 million more homes by 2020.  In<I> Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I> we outline how this housing programme will respond to one of the great challenges for housing in the 21st century, an ageing population.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0802256000022"></a>The cross-Government strategy explains why change is needed: the significant financial impacts on the country given demographic pressures and the quality of life for older people.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0802256000023"></a>In<I> Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I> the Government set out the need for planning for ageing, with a commitment to build all public housing to lifetime homes standards by 2011 and a new aspiration to build all homes to lifetime homes standards by 2013. It sets out a new vision for lifetime neighbourhoods and how this will be tested.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0802256000024"></a>The strategy sets out the need for increased investment in repairs and adaptations services and improved housing advice and information, supported by an additional &#163;35 million over two years from 2009-11.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0802256000025"></a><I>Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I> also outlines our programme of investment and reform of the Government&#146;s disabled facilities grant programme, which currently helps nearly 35,000 live independently in their homes through the provision of major home adaptations.  The work for which a disabled facilities grant may be made is wide ranging, providing for access to the property and access to the basic facilities within a home, such as walk-in showers and stair lifts.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0802256000026"></a>Disabled facilities grants are predominantly received by older people and so are integral to this strategy. Our proposals for the modernisation and improvement of this important grant represents our response to the recommendations of the Bristol report published in 2005.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0802256000027"></a>In response to rising demand we have already announced an increase in the disabled facilities grant which will take the national budget to &#163;146 million in England for 2008-09. And today we are announcing the individual allocations for local authorities.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0802256000028"></a>There will be further increases for the next two years which will bring the disabled facilities budget up to &#163;166 million by 2010. This represents a significant investment by the Government in this important policy and will enable even more people to benefit from the programme. Changes being made to the programme include raising the limit on disabled facilities grant to &#163;30,000.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0802256000029"></a>Other changes to the means test will speed up the process and bring extra help for people working but on a low income. Changes to the rules of the scheme will also simplify and speed up the process of providing adaptations.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0802256000030"></a>The full list of changes to the disabled facilities grant programme can viewed on the following link at <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingmanagementcare/housingadaptations/">www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingmanagementcare/housingadaptations/</a>.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0802256000031"></a>The strategy also makes it clear that housing plays a critical part in staying well and independent in later life. <I>Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I> seeks to strengthen the links between housing and health. Key principles are to ensure the services for older people are joined up and personal to them. <I>Lifetime Homes, Lifetime Neighbourhoods</I> also sets out a new vision for specialised housing for older people with growing dependency supported by new investment of &#163;80 million in extra care housing from the Department of Health.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="0802256000033"></a>Kent and Cheshire County Councils and Stoke-on-Trent City Council have been invited to work with Communities and Local Government to develop their proposals for schemes to deliver new extra care and supported housing.  These new homes will include a range of assistive technology and allow for future adaptations enabling the elderly and the vulnerable to live independent lives and be part of their local communities.</p>

<a name="80225-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0802256000034"></a>This announcement follows a review of the capital build costs of delivering new build social rented housing through PFI, which demonstrates that the capital build costs for PFI procured units can be comparable with those for schemes funded through the Housing Corporation&#146;s social housing grant.   Communities and Local Government will work with the new schemes to take forward the next stage of the review to examine other costs associated with housing PFI projects.</p>

Therefore, for example, we have improved pay and introduced new equipment. We have improved accommodation and continue to do so pledging &#163;8 billion over a 10-year period. We have also made improvements to travel allowances to permit personnel to get home more easily and we continue to refine the operational welfare package while also promoting measures such as work/life balance and career breaks to improve the day-to-day lives of service personnel and their families.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_47"></a><a name="0802254000069"></a>However, it is true that there are significant challenges in keeping some groups up to strength. Consequently some areas, for example the infantry and medical specialist, are busier than intended. Retention measures such as commitment bonuses, re-engagement packages, and financial retention initiatives (FRI) continue to be used to encourage longer service, improve morale and reduce voluntary outflow. There is a FRI in place for infantry soldiers at the four-year point, and more than 2,000 soldiers have signed up for this package.</p>

This led to a three-year gender equality action plan (GEAP).</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_52"></a><a name="0802254000082"></a>A network of gender champions has been established across the department consisting of deputy directors, who are responsible for promoting gender equality. They report on progress against the GEAP in their divisions on a quarterly basis to the senior gender champion who is the director general for Policy and International Division and a member of DfID's top management team. Gender equality issues are reflected as a target within our first departmental strategic objective in DfID's corporate performance framework, linked to our new PSA Delivery Agreement for 2008-11.</p>

The action plan is a living document and while the aims will stay the same, the diversity team is in the process of updating the plans to reflect any changes and to show progress. This will feed into DfID's 2007-08 Annual Diversity Report.</p>
