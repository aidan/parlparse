The Prime Minister regularly meets members of the Armed Forces involved in operations at all levels, including those in command. He did so again only last week when he was in Afghanistan. On that occasion, he was accompanied by the Chief of the Defence Staff. The Prime Minister will continue to meet members of the Armed Forces at all levels, including the Chiefs of Staff, as appropriate.</p>

I know that those visits are appreciated by our troops and by the Prime Minister, who feels that direct contact with those on operations is extremely important. I also know that many Members of this House have visited troops on operations. We are happy to arrange that, bearing in mind that we do not want to overburden those who are performing those operations.</p>

We will continue to support measures to address religious tensions through our conflict prevention strategy, including support for NGOs working with communities in northern states and dialogue with the authorities.</p>

On a visit to northern Nigeria over Easter, I and my colleagues found incontrovertible evidence that the recent violence in Bauchi, Plateau and Niger states was religiously motivated, with attacks by well armed Muslim militants, assisted by foreign mercenaries, who have targeted Christian communities, killed hundreds of Christians and destroyed more than 50 churches and many hundreds of Christian homes and businesses. There was no reciprocal comparable violence against the Muslim communities. Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government make serious representations to the Nigerian authorities and Government to ensure adequate protection for all citizens?</p>

I asked the British high commissioner to go to northern Nigeria to make a reassessment based on the facts that the noble Baroness shared with me, and he is there this week doing just that. Among other things, he will discuss the issues raised with the governor of Bauchi, one of the two states that have been affected. The noble Baroness knows well that there are disagreements about to what extent the violence is triggered by the marginalisation of certain groups and by the level of poverty, for which religion is an excuse, and to what extent it is a religiously triggered conflict. We need to get to the bottom of this, and we will go on pressing the Nigerian authorities to try to end these troubles.</p>

Northern Nigeria is a huge area; if it were a country, it would be the second biggest in Africa, with tens of millions of people. It has some of the worst social indicators anywhere in the world, so it is actually the subject of DfID&#146;s largest bilateral programme in the world, because we are trying to target poverty in the north.</p>

What have the Government done to get from the Nigerians word about the two commissions of inquiry that were commissioned on recent events by the federal and state Governments respectively? Have our Government taken up with the Nigerian Government implementation of recommendation 31 by the UPR working group on promoting a culture of religious tolerance and protecting the rights of religious minorities?</p>

We have pressed on the President and Ministers&#151;I have pressed them personally&#151;that they must do a better job on this. We followed with great care the progress of the two commissions to which the noble Lord refers. However, we are not convinced that enough steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence. In that sense, I do not want to convey to the House that we have any confidence that there will not be repetitions of what has tragically happened.</p>

Also, when the Minister is carrying out the assessment that he is undertaking about these events, will the role of the mercenaries who have been arrested in Nigeria&#151;75 of them have come from places such as Niger, Chad and Saudi Arabia&#151;be properly assessed?</p>

I do not know the exact amount given to the group displaced in Bauchi; we will need to get back to him. I want to be clear that DfID is trying to work directly with local authorities and communities to ensure that not just the sources of conflict are addressed, but that there is better access to healthcare and education and a strengthened security and justice sector, as well as immunisation for children. Whatever the balance of cause for this between religious faith and poverty, we need to address both.</p>

In the past two or three years, we have seen attacks by Hindu on Muslim, Sunni on Shia and, sadly, in Rwanda and in Kenya, Christian on Christian, including the burning of churches with people inside.

In northern Nigeria it is Christians who in general are in the minority, although Plateau State, where this started last November, is a majority Christian state. Nevertheless it is Christians who have borne the brunt of the violence and are in that sense the besieged minority; so it is an appropriate Question with regard to northern Nigeria, but I am glad to have the opportunity to confirm that faiths of all kinds equally deserve our support.</p>

Reference was made specifically to the health service. The UK is compliant with judgments on on-call time. The Department of Health no longer operates widespread on-call working and has moved instead to a shift-working system. The NHS has made excellent progress but still requires, in a small minority of challenging services, a little more time to reduce the hours to 48 a week. This is allowed in the directive.

A person may want to work longer hours&#151;perhaps for family reasons or in an emergency. Would it not be not only economically disadvantageous to this country but gravely detrimental to the rights of the individual if in those circumstances he was prevented from working?

It is interesting to note, however, that the UK has the lowest proportion within the EU of those reporting that their work causes health effects such as stress. Therefore, the working hours themselves are clearly seen by the majority of the population not to be a problem. Working hours have in fact fallen in the UK: 20 per cent fewer full-time employees usually worked more than 48 hours in 2007 than did so in 1997.</p>

Particularly in remote rural areas, veterinary surgeons are very concerned about the working hours directive because it means that they cannot direct a young veterinary assistant to go out in the middle of the night to deliver a calf where there is a difficult delivery and then take responsibility if that young vet crashes on the way home because he is too tired. There are problems with the working hours directive not just for human medicine but for veterinary medicine.</p>

The air is mixed and passed through high-efficiency particulate air filters, which are 99.97 per cent efficient at removing bacteria, viruses and particulate material. The total volume of cabin air is exchanged every two to three minutes, compared with every five to 10 minutes in most air-conditioned buildings.</p>

Unfortunately, this 99 per cent that he mentions is what the manufacturers say; they say that they construct the filters in such a way that they will filter the viruses. However, they have never tested these filters, which clearly cannot filter viruses out; I personally have inspected them. The problem is that that air is full of all sorts of bugs including tuberculosis and viruses such as swine flu.</p>

However, I know of no evidence to the effect of what he affirms. I know that I spent 3,500 hours breathing such air, that it is sourced from very clean air&#151;way above the earth most of the time&#151;and that it is heated cooled. It is very good air; the only thing wrong with it is that it is a bit thin and rather dry.</p>

I can vouch for the fact that many passengers come in at night&#151;they fly over Kew to come to Heathrow&#151;so can the Minister explain how those passengers who come into this country at night are going to be screened for swine flu or any other infectious disease?</p>

The essence of the prevention measures taken by the airlines lies in observing their passengers, in ensuring that people with any symptoms recognised on the aircraft are isolated and reported to the appropriate authorities and in continuing the appropriate tracking of any passengers adjacent to them. If there is anything that I can add about opening hours at Heathrow, I will write to the noble Baroness.</p>

There is no evidence that the pressurised cabin makes the transmission of disease more likely. Simple viral infections may be transmitted due to the proximity of individuals who may have such conditions. The airline industry has developed a series of working procedures with the World Health Organisation, IATA and ICAO and issues specific guidelines to cabin crew, cleaners and maintenance crew, the whole object of which is to concentrate on the other hygiene issues associated with this condition. In the United Kingdom, those standards were already being adhered to by British carriers.</p>

Indeed, there are grave concerns over the air toxicity in airlines at this time. A survey is being undertaken by the Cranfield Institute of Technology on this air toxicity, which rather goes to show that the air filters do not work properly in planes. Will he say when the Cranfield Institute of Technology will report on air toxicity in airliners?</p>

The Government are taking seriously the concern about toxicity. We believe that there is a problem and have committed to the study as a precautionary measure. In fact, the Committee on Toxicity said that there was no proof either way that there was any connection between the bleed air in the cabin and pilot health. I cannot give an exact date by which Cranfield University will produce its report, but it is actively engaged in the cabin air sampling programme with five participating airlines. I hope that the peer review study will be published as a whole as soon as is practicable.</p>

<p><a name="0905057000226"></a>From what the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, said in Committee, it is fairly clear that that is the intention of the Government. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="0905057000251"></a>&#147;To assist the MMO in fulfilling its objective, that relevant expertise and experience should as far as possible be drawn from one or more of the pillars of sustainable development; in other words, board members should have experience of environmental, economic and/or social issues&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905057000227"></a>That was all set out in the helpful briefing note that has been provided and, I think, published on the department&#146;s website. The Minister then said,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="0905057000252"></a>&#147;The second consideration is the need to ensure a proper balance of skills and experience so the board functions effectively and adds value to the organisation as a whole&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905057000228"></a>Finally, he talked about the need for people of the highest calibre to be appointed, and said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="0905057000253"></a>&#147;That must be a prime consideration&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="0905057000229"></a>although,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000295"></a>&#147;we need to ensure that those high calibre members come from a variety of specified backgrounds to ensure that the board works as effectively as possible&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/1/09; col. 1051.]</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000076"></a>I think that the Minister was, in saying those things, speaking in favour of this amendment, which would simply put the principle of everything that he said into the Bill. That ought to be done, and I do not understand any reasons why it should not be.</p>

<a name="90505-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0905057000077"></a>Amendment 2 refers to the number. The Minister stated clearly in Committee that, while the Bill states that the number of members should be no fewer than five and no more than eight, plus the chair&#151;that is, six to nine including the chair&#151;the Government intended, nevertheless, that there would be, at least in the first instance, the full complement allowed by that range. Some of us argued that if that was the case it would be sensible to raise the number to the middle of the range, but that was not a major issue of principle. It is clear that the Government intend to appoint a chair and eight other members. I do not quibble with that and I am content that that is a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="90505-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0905057000078"></a>This amendment says that, under the further powers of the Secretary of State to change the range of the number of members from five to eight to other figures, the number of members should not fall below five. That is the minimum number necessary to make sense of not just what the Government will do during the inauguration of the MMO but also to make sense of what future Governments and Secretaries of State might wish to do. I therefore suggest that, whatever the Secretary of State might propose, he cannot go below five members plus the chair. That is the absolute minimum that would be appropriate if the MMO is to succeed in its work. Therefore, that should be in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

We had a good debate in Committee on the composition of the MMO board. It certainly is not possible to have every interest group represented on the board: it would quite clearly be too unwieldy. There was consensus from all around the Committee that marine science and marine conservation expertise should be available to the board, whether as a member of the board or through the ability of the board to call in the expertise to give evidence. Provided that ability exists&#151;I should be grateful for that assurance from the Minister&#151;clearly, the most important skill of a member of the board is good judgment. The Committee also had concerns over the board&#146;s ability to form a quorum, which would be exacerbated if the number fell below five. I ask the Minister whether he envisages the number ever falling below five.</p>

It allows the Secretary of State to appoint people to the board who have experience related to the MMO&#146;s functions. As the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, has said, we debated this in Committee. I think that there is general consensus that we do not want what might be described as sectoral representation on the MMO&#146;s board but we do seek members with experience and expertise across all three pillars of sustainable development&#151;economic, environmental and social. With a board of between five and eight members, which we think is entirely appropriate, it is not possible specifically to represent all the functions of the MMO. I agree with the noble

<a name="90505-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0905057000082"></a>On the question of whether the board would have available to it expertise in marine science and conservation, whether among the board membership or available to the board, I reply in the affirmative. We will come on to the third group of amendments where we will debate the Government&#146;s amendment to ensure that a chief scientific adviser is appointed. I said in Committee that there will be a scientific advisory committee, which the MMO will appoint to advise it. I can reassure the noble Earl on those matters.</p>

<a name="90505-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0905057000083"></a>Amendment 2 ensures that the number of board members does not fall below five. I have considerable sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on this point. I would have liked to have accepted his amendment as it is. Alas, as ever, I am advised that parliamentary counsel would like to have a look at it. Will the noble Lord accept that I will seek further advice on this and come back to him? In light of that, I would welcome a further amendment from him at Third Reading.</p>

It is a matter of common sense. I will be delighted to move a further amendment at Third Reading if I receive instructions from the Minister or his advisers on what the wording should be. On the question of the composition of, and the range of expertise and experience on, the board, I do not think that there is any difference of opinion between myself and the Minister, or, indeed, between us and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. We all agree on what should happen and how. I am simply suggesting that the Bill should say slightly more strongly what we all want to see. We certainly do not want to see sectoral representation or representation of individual organisations. We have all been convinced that that is not the way forward. However, it seems that I am not going to persuade the Minister. The Bill has a long way to go before it reaches Royal Assent and these matters may be discussed further in the House of Commons. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment 1.</p>

They are all minor and technical in nature, but they are necessary to improve the clarity of the drafting. I apologise for the number of amendments.

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0905057000086"></a>Amendments 3 and 4 add new text to paragraph 9 of Schedule 1. The paragraph provides the grounds on which the Secretary of State can suspend or terminate the appointment of the chair, deputy chair or any MMO board member. The form of words that we have added ensures that all appropriate Scottish law on forms of insolvency is included in these grounds.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0905057000087"></a>Amendment 26 to Clause 7 is a minor and technical amendment that corrects a reference in this clause to Section 4B of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. The clause refers to functions that the MMO exercises under Section 4B of that Act, whereas it exercises those functions under Sections 4 and 4A, so the clause should refer to those sections instead.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0905057000088"></a>Amendment 27 inserts a reference in Clause 9(3) to the area in which this clause is applicable, which is in relation to the whole or any part of England or the English inshore region. The reason for this is to limit the geographical scope of this transitional provision to that particular area. This is consistent with the other transitional provisions in subsection (2) and is necessary because the Secretary of State&#146;s functions under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970 are being transferred to the MMO only in respect of England and the English inshore region. It follows that any application made to the Secretary of State before the commencement of the Bill that is to be treated in future as being made to the MMO should relate only to licences applying in England and the English inshore region.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0905057000089"></a>Amendments 28 and 29 to Clauses 9(3) and 10(5) respectively allow applications for licences that have been made but not withdrawn before the licensing functions are transferred to the MMO to be treated as applications made to the MMO after the coming into force of these sections. Amendments 30 to 32 reword Clause 12(3) so that it mirrors the wording of Clause 13(3). As currently drafted, the clause might inadvertently transfer functions relating to Scottish generating stations to the MMO in the future if the existing Executive devolution order is repealed and a new one put in its place because the revocation would return the functions to the Secretary of State. This clause would then transfer them to the MMO before the new Executive devolution order took effect. The amendments are needed to prevent this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0905057000090"></a>Amendments 33 and 34 to Clause 13 make a small change to the wording so as to remove references to &#147;Scottish areas&#148; and the definition of this term. It has been removed because it is not a term used elsewhere in the Bill. Amendments 35 and 37 change Clause 14(3)(a) to exclude people employed by the Scottish or Welsh Administrations from the definition of a person employed in the Civil Service of the state in this clause. The clause is intended only to apply to people employed by the English Administration, but as drafted it inadvertently includes those in Scotland and Wales, and we want to correct that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0905057000091"></a>Amendment 40 is a minor amendment to Clause 18 that would remove the word &#147;marine&#148; so that the drafting is consistent in Chapter 3 of Part 1, in particular

Perhaps I may declare my interest merely in the welfare of fish in and around Scotland, which is relevant to the Bill. This group of amendments is a fine illustration of what it takes to keep everything as tidy as possible when you have devolution settlements at the core of your legislation. The Scots will be pleased to see Amendments 27 to 29 as they are anxious to maintain their own management of policy over the culling of seals. Amendments 30 to 32 deserve a prize for the man who managed to dig it up in the effort to produce legislation that will cope with future repeals of powers, as it will prevent Scotland losing out on its current blanket power over all electricity generation if there is any repeal of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0905057000094"></a>The one puzzle to me around Clause 13 and Amendment 33 is that it is in the Bill to deal with safety zones, but Section 95 of the Energy Act 2004 deals only with safety zones around renewable energy installations. Scotland has powers to implement other types of energy generating stations, so these will not be covered by this legislation if they happen to be envisaged.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0905057000095"></a>Amendments 32 and 34 are linked, as they try to find the right placement in the Bill for the definition of &#147;Scottish waters&#148; and &#147;the Scottish part&#148; in relation to renewable energy zones. The Bill endeavours to emphasise that these phrases have the same meaning as in Section 95 of the Energy Act although, as far as I can see, that section does not, in itself, have any definition of those terms in relation to Scottish waters.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0905057000096"></a>This brings me to the puzzling way in which the Government have defined the marine areas up in the north. The Bill refers in the main to the Scottish inshore area and the Scottish offshore area, as if, at a certain level, they have an equivalence. However, this part has the much more definitive term &#147;Scottish waters&#148;, which represents the fact that the inshore area is part of Scotland and is the term used in previous legislation. Surely the Minister must admit that consistency would be better served if this term were used throughout the Bill. This would also emphasise the very different framework that governs the Scottish offshore area and the Scottish inshore area and how it might be more appropriately labelled to demonstrate

I have to say that I went through the rest of them with a fine-toothed comb, because I have a basic principle that, if the Government put forward a long list of technical amendments like this, somewhere in the middle there is something that they are trying to get through without anyone noticing. I do not think that there is in this group; I think that the amendments are entirely sensible, so I have no further comments to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0905057000099"></a>I want to emphasise to the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, that we are concerned to have the same reference to the Scottish position throughout the Bill. The problem with the definition in this clause is that we had not taken consistency throughout the Bill sufficiently into account, which is why this amendment is necessary. We have now removed reference to Scottish areas and the definition of the term, but the danger, as the noble Duke indicated, was that we would have a lack of consistency and clarity in our reference to the position in Scotland. We have looked at this carefully and consider that with this amendment we have made the references consistent with the rest of the Bill. We will come on to the Scottish position on inshore waters when we refer to the Scottish marine Bill, which is the responsibility of the devolved Administration.</p>

He will accept that the Government do not want to change definitions in other Acts but to be consistent with them. We have introduced consistent terms: by &#147;inshore waters&#148; we mean nought to 12 nautical miles, while &#147;offshore&#148; refers to 12 to 200 nautical miles. We have that throughout the Bill and it applies to all UK waters, so we are consistent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0905057000102"></a>As I have indicated, we are bound to have some reference in other amendments to the work of the Scottish Parliament in its devolved responsibilities, which it will produce in the marine Bill that it will consider in the not-too-distant future. However, I reassure the noble Duke that we are not changing the sense of the position but seeking to make it consistent.

That objective now has three core elements: first, the obligation to make a contribution to the achievement of sustainable development; secondly, a new obligation to take account of all relevant facts and matters, which are set out in detail in Amendment 9; and, thirdly, a duty to act in a consistent and co-ordinated way.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0905057000105"></a>We have preserved the wording of the MMO&#146;s objective to make,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000299"></a>&#147;a contribution to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000233"></a>in order to maintain consistency with the terminology used throughout the Bill, notably in Clause 56. That is also consistent with other legislation and, in particular, to that related to planning. However, we have now added a broad power in Amendment 8 for the MMO to do anything that it considers necessary or expedient to help it to achieve its general objective by,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000300"></a>&#147;furthering any social, economic or environmental purposes&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90505-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0905057000106"></a>In Amendment 7, in relation to the types of material to which the MMO might wish to have regard when carrying out its functions and making decisions, we started with the new core duty in Clause 2(1)(b), to which I have already referred. The reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000301"></a>&#147;all relevant facts and matters&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000234"></a>includes scientific and other evidence, with a read-across at the end to Clause 23, under which the MMO can undertake or commission research.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0905057000107"></a>Amendment 5 is perhaps an appropriate point at which to remind noble Lords of the undertaking that I made in Committee to establish a science advisory committee, which demonstrates our commitment to an evidence-based approach for the MMO. I hope that noble Lords will also welcome our additional undertaking today to appoint a chief scientific adviser to the MMO.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0905057000108"></a>Turning back to Amendment 9 to Clause 2, while emphasising the importance of an evidence-based approach, we would not wish to give the impression that specific mention of scientific evidence gives greater weight to any one aspect of sustainable development compared to the other aspects. In order to ensure that relevant evidence such as environmental and socio-economic data is not seen as less important, proposed paragraph (b) includes other evidence relating to each limb of sustainable development. Other matters that might be relevant to a given case are encapsulated in proposed paragraph (c).</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0905057000109"></a>In Amendment 18, by including a definition of evidence for the purposes of Clause 2, we have endeavoured to address any concern that, on a narrow reading, the word &#147;evidence&#148; might not include studies that predict or project the likely future condition of the seas. This definition makes it clear that &#147;evidence&#148; includes predictions and other opinions resulting from the consideration of evidence.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0905057000110"></a>I hope that the rewording of the MMO&#146;s general objective, to which we have given careful consideration, will meet the approval of noble Lords. We have also gone further in response to concerns relating to the accountability of the MMO. Amendment 58 deletes subsection (3) so that Clause 36 now provides that the guidance to be given to the MMO by the Secretary of State on its sustainable development objective, and any other guidance issued by the Secretary of State to the MMO, will be subject to consultation with such bodies or persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate. Amendments 16 and 17 to Clause 2 further provide that the guidance to be given to the MMO by the Secretary of State on its sustainable development objective will be laid before each House of Parliament in draft, following which it will be given to the MMO and published by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0905057000111"></a>I believe that this package of amendments very much meets many of the legitimate issues and concerns raised in Committee. The legislation will provide a clear and firm footing to the MMO in relation to its objectives. I believe that the appointment of a chief scientific adviser and the commitment that I have already given to establishing a scientific advisory committee meet the points on scientific evidence. I hope that this package of measures in general receives support from your Lordships. I beg to move.</p>

In Committee, I declared that I was the chairman of the board of trustees of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, an unpaid post. Since February, I have ceased to be its chairman&#151;not, I add hastily, because I have been summarily dismissed, but because my term of office of seven years came to an end. However, I have found myself quickly accelerated to the post of chairman of the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership, also unpaid.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0905057000114"></a>I welcome Amendment 5, which requires the MMO to appoint a person to be its chief scientific adviser. That goes further than was required by many of your Lordships in Committee and I am delighted that the Government have reached that decision. The Minister also referred to the establishment of a scientific advisory committee, about which I am also delighted. That does not appear in the Bill, but I understand that it will be a requirement to be included in subsequent guidance issued to the MMO. I also welcome the change that the Government have made in Amendment 7 by inserting a third stipulation in the clause designating general objectives. New paragraph (b) requires the MMO to take account of,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000302"></a>&#147;all relevant facts and matters&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90505-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0905057000115"></a>My only hesitations relate to government Amendment 9, which seeks to elaborate on new paragraph (b) in Amendment 7. In order for me to clarify my two amendments, Amendments 10 and 11, I need to read out Amendment 9, which inserts new subsection (1B) into Clause 2:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0905057000260"></a>&#147;For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), the facts and matters that may be taken into account include each of the following&#151;</p>
 (a) scientific evidence, whether available to, or reasonably obtainable by, the MMO; (b) other evidence so available or obtainable relating to the social, economic or environmental elements of sustainable development; (c) such facts or matters not falling within paragraph (a) or (b) as the MMO may consider appropriate&#148;. 
<a name="90505-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0905057000116"></a>I am puzzled about two things. The first is that the word used in the introductory part of the amendment should be &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;shall&#148;. I have tabled Amendment 10 because, if the MMO simply may take into account scientific evidence and,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000303"></a>&#147;other evidence so available or obtainable relating to the social, economic or environmental elements of sustainable development&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000235"></a>what is the point of stipulating them at all? It clearly may take them into account under the general objective in paragraph (b) in Amendment 7. Surely new subsection (1B) will bite only if the MMO must take those matters into account and must regard them as relevant. Of course, the weight that it gives those relevant matters is entirely within its discretion. It may give them very little weight or in certain circumstances none at all, but they will plainly be relevant. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the correct verb is not &#147;may&#148; but &#147;shall&#148;.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0905057000117"></a>My second quibble is on paragraph (c) in new subsection (1B). I remind the House that new paragraph (c) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000304"></a>&#147;such facts or matters not falling within paragraph (a) or (b)&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000236"></a>those are the paragraphs that cover scientific, social, economic and environmental matters&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000305"></a>&#147;as the MMO may consider appropriate&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_453"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 453</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0905057000237"></a>The word &#147;appropriate&#148; appears there for the first time. It is not defined anywhere. What happens if a matter is relevant but the MMO does not consider it appropriate? Surely the better word to substitute for &#147;appropriate&#148; in new paragraph (c) would be &#147;relevant&#148;.</p>

<a name="90505-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0905057000118"></a>Finally, I entirely concur with Amendment 18. The Government propose to define &#147;evidence&#148; as including,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000306"></a>&#147;predictions and other opinions resulting from the consideration of evidence by any person&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000238"></a>It is well known that, in terms of hard evidence, we have knowledge of only about 2 to 3 per cent of the waters that the Bill seeks to cover. The only way in which we can come to sensible scientific conclusions about the other 97 or 98 per cent is by using scientific models to make predictions from the little evidence that we have. It is, therefore, absolutely essential that these modelling procedures should be included in the definition of &#147;evidence&#148; and I am delighted that the Government have done so.</p>

I am not sure that I quite understood what the Minister said about scientific evidence. I am an engineer who used to have a nodding acquaintance with science. I thought that I heard him say that other matters would be taken into account in addition to scientific evidence. I also thought that I heard him say&#151;I may be wrong&#151;that one matter that may be taken into account is opinion. I am not sure that opinion has any kind of equivalence to scientific evidence. I hope that I misheard the noble Lord. It looks as though I did, because he is nodding his head. Perhaps he can clear my mind about that later.</p>

Amendment 5 talks about the appointment of a chief scientific adviser and that person being an employee of the MMO. Is it anticipated that he will be a full-time professional with the MMO or will he be one of the great and the good who is brought in for specific purposes? That is not clear in the amendment.</p>

Like other speakers, I believe that we should be very grateful to the Government for doing a lot of hard work in bringing them forward. Some of them are not exactly as we would have phrased them. In particular, we would have gone further in having a clear bias towards conservation rather than the equivalence of the three pillars as the Government refer to sustainable development. Nevertheless, the amendments are a substantial step forward compared with the text of the Bill when first presented to the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0905057000122"></a>If this were the House of Commons considering the Bill for the first time before sending it to the Lords, we would be looking for points of division and difference at this stage and sending it away with those clear points of difference expressed through Divisions. The culture of this House is a little different. Sometimes we are more bent towards consensus where it can be achieved rather than division. A lot of noble Lords  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_454"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>around the House will think that what we have is not ideal but it is a great deal better than what we were first presented with. The Government have clearly listened to the very long debate that we had in Committee&#151;I think that it lasted about a day but the Minister indicates that it was longer&#151;on this and related matters. We should be grateful for that. The Conservatives have added their names to some of the amendments. These Benches have not done that but we are certainly prepared to support them at this stage as a basis for sending this Bill to the House of Commons in a better condition. Then the House of Commons can start again and have a good thrash over it down there.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0905057000123"></a>These amendments are fundamental. Some of us who have been talking informally with the Government and their advisers over the past few weeks are aware that they have struggled to come up with this wording. However, the struggle has been worth while, and therefore we should thank them for doing so.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0905057000124"></a>The first major point here concerns science. Different points of view were put forward in Committee regarding how a stronger emphasis on the scientific basis of decisions by the MMO should be expressed. Some thought that should be done through committees while others suggested that it should be done through advisers or specific membership of the board. The Government have come up with a good proposal. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, asked a very important question, to which we shall be interested to hear the answer. This should not be a part-time, one day a month, ring up for advice when you want it sort of post. It is a fundamental post as far as the MMO is concerned. Having said that, the Government&#146;s solution is welcome and we support it.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0905057000125"></a>More fundamental even than that is the Government&#146;s substantial rewrite of Clause 2. There was great concern that there was not much in it initially and that the Government were talking only about making a consistent and co-ordinated contribution to the achievement of sustainable development. However, the Government have added the need to take account,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000307"></a>&#147;of all relevant facts and matters&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000239"></a>and defined them in new Section (1B), which states that they have to be based on,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000308"></a>&#147;scientific evidence ... other evidence so available or obtainable relating to the social, economic or environmental elements of sustainable development&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000240"></a>It is interesting that the Government are beginning to get close to a definition of sustainable development, which they did not want to do. However, they are edging closer to that and they will inevitably have to define it.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0905057000126"></a>The third element of the facts and matters that need to be taken into account is really anything else that the, &#147;MMO may consider appropriate&#148;. That is sensible and a good basis, particularly when taken together with the next section on guidance. The Government have managed to include &#147;furthering&#148;, although not exactly in the way in which many Members of the Committee wanted. I congratulate them on their ingenuity in doing that. Government Amendment 8 refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000309"></a>&#147;furthering any social, economic or environmental purposes&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0905057000241"></a>The Government have included three pillars of sustainable development in their Amendment 9, which must come close to being the foundation and a definition of it. That is coming very close to furthering sustainable development. I understand that is as close as the Government can get to meeting the requests that came from all around the Committee. Nevertheless, it is a great step forward.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0905057000127"></a>The sections on guidance are interesting. If I have understood them correctly, Government Amendments 55 to 58 are technical and tidying-up amendments as a result of government Amendments 13 to 18. First, they make the guidance that the Secretary of State has to give to the MMO in relation to its objectives much more specific and much clearer. Secondly, it has to be laid before both Houses of Parliament. Thirdly, it makes it subject to something that looks very like the negative procedure on statutory instruments. This is very unusual in relation to guidance as opposed to orders and regulations&#151;the normal statutory instruments that we are used to&#151;because of the fact that there is not a procedure that can be referred to. The procedure has to be set out here and it has to be 40 days and 40 nights and so on. There is the opportunity for either House to table what is, in effect, a negative resolution against the guidance that is being put forward.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0905057000128"></a>Very often, we take the view that the negative procedure in relation to statutory instruments is not all that important. In this House, we very rarely vote against a statutory instrument, never mind use the negative procedure, and debates are on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and are formalised. That is true. Nevertheless, statutory instruments are scrutinised through a number of different committees of both Houses. They are subject to debate and if the Government get things wrong they risk looking stupid or just being shown to be wrong. This all means that the care that is put into the drawing up of statutory instruments is all that much greater than it otherwise would be. That is going to be the case with this guidance. What either House does with the guidance when it gets it is up to the House. We in this House, if we wish, could set up a procedure during the 40 days and 40 nights to scrutinise the legislation in some way&#151;in the way statutory instruments are scrutinised or even in a more thorough way. The opportunity is there if we wish to take it.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0905057000129"></a>I believe that this is a great step forward. This is very important guidance indeed, because it is going to be fundamental to what the MMO does and the way in which it works. Therefore, I very much welcome it. However, we should be clear that, in a sense, this is pushing the boundaries a little bit of the powers and activities of Parliament and the powers and activities of this House. I am not complaining about that; I am all in favour of it. We should be aware that we are doing that and, if it is not new ground, it is unusual ground. On that basis, the Government should be congratulated on being a little bit innovative in the way in which they are approaching this. They are being innovative in a way that puts more power and influence in the hands of Parliament and of this House in particular. Having said that, we welcome the amendments and we are prepared to support them today.</p>

It is important that the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, be properly addressed. I speak with some experience of this, having done rather more than five years as Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0905057000131"></a>Two elements are important. First, there is the seniority of the appointment. Secondly, there is the amount of time. Seniority is extremely important, because in the Civil Service, in agencies and elsewhere seniority determines how much you are listened to. It is very important that this person be listened to. It determines which meetings you attend and whether you are aware of the total business that is going on in the organisation. It is important that it is a senior position. I judge from the form of the amendment that it is intended that this be senior, because the appointment of an individual has to be approved by the Secretary of State. The MoD made its Chief Scientific Adviser appointment at Permanent Secretary level, and I believe that it still does. That is the sort of clout that is needed.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0905057000132"></a>Secondly, the time commitment, too, is very important&#151;certainly in the early years when the appointee is learning, if I may put it this way, where the stamps are kept. You have to know how the operation works, and where your help will be needed and useful. The problem is that many people in the department do not know that they need advice or help in particular areas, so the person holding the post must be proactive. In the early years, this involves a significant commitment of time. I worked full-time; I do not think that the post has to be full-time, but in the early years one is really looking at four days a week to be effective. Later, when things are under way and the MMO is better established, it could be less. However, it would be very important for the Minister to take account of these things in his guidance to the organisation.</p>

I declare an interest as joint president of London Councils. London boroughs would not normally be thought of as coastal, but some points in the Bill may affect them; and, as my noble friend reminds me, I live on a tidal part of the Thames.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0905057000134"></a>The first question follows the comments made by other noble Lords about the chief scientific adviser. I wonder about the provision for approval by the Secretary of State of most of the terms and conditions of employment. I am not arguing with the Secretary of State&#146;s power of approval over the appointment, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has just mentioned. However, there must be many provisions other than those that fall within paragraphs 16 and 17, which are about remuneration and pensions. I cannot believe that the Secretary of State should be looking at things like holidays and sick leave. It is a small point, but that would be micromanagement at a nano level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0905057000137"></a>My other question arises from Amendment 18, which provides for co-ordination between the MMO&#146;s area and other areas. The MMO&#146;s area is largely the UK marine area, which includes the sea, the seabed and the subsoil to high water&#151;we find that later in the Bill. Will the Minister explain how the Government anticipate that the relationship between the MMO and the local authorities will be dealt with? Local authority areas go down to mean low water. There is an overlap there, because the MMO area goes to mean high water. Will proposed new Clause 2(8) be a basis for inter-authority working? I am using the government amendment to ask a wide-ranging question, because this is relevant to the marine policy statement, marine plans and real-world decisions. I think that it was the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, who at the last stage referred to offshore energy and the point at which it comes onshore. My noble friends and I are still unclear about how the relationships will work and who will take the lead and the necessary decisions covering certain geographic points.</p>

I also very much welcome the fact that the Government have already said that the MMO can set up a scientific advisory committee, which was another of our broad recommendations. The fact that they are going further and appointing a chief scientific adviser is a bonus.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0905057000139"></a>I am also pleased that the Government are keeping the three pillars of sustainable development on an equal footing. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves: I do not think that the environment, or whatever, should take precedence over the others. There should be a correct balance. That is what the Government propose; that is absolutely right and I welcome it.</p>

Details are available in the register, but I am sure that I should tell the House that I am a grower, farmer and landowner. I am a member of the NFU, the Farmers&#146; Company and a number of agricultural societies and conservation bodies. I am also a member of the National Trust, which owns substantial areas adjacent to the coast. My wife is and has been for the past 20 years the Lincolnshire County Council member for Holbeach, which includes the large expanse of Holbeach marsh, which stretches for many miles out into the Wash. It is an area that I have known well since childhood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0905057000141"></a>I thank the Minister for moving the amendments. It is clear from the addition of my name and that of my noble friend Lord Cathcart to them that they have our support. I am very grateful to the Minister and his officials for what he said constructively with us and other noble Lords during the past few weeks. I may add very little that is new to the general view of other noble Lords in this debate but, as the Minister explained, the amendments cover several important aspects of the MMO and it is right that the Opposition's voice is added in their support.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0905057000142"></a>We are very glad that the Government have taken our concerns about the scientific basis for the MMO's decision-making seriously. The addition of a chief scientific adviser is a great step forward, as is the stated duty in Clause 2 to base decisions on fact. We hope that the amendments will benefit the MMO by ensuring that it has sufficient in-house expertise for the often difficult decisions that it will be called on to make, and will make those decisions based on fact. The appointment of the chief scientific adviser will also, I hope, act as a figurehead for the development of marine science generally. We all seek to establish government bodies on as professional and effective a footing as possible. We see the amendments as an important step towards that goal.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0905057000143"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland has two amendments in the group. The Government's response owes much to the way in which he has contributed to and articulated the argument for the changes in Committee. I will leave it to the Minister to respond to my noble friend&#146;s amendments.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0905057000144"></a>The other amendments in the group are also extremely welcome and go a long way towards addressing our concerns about the drafting of Clause 2. The Government have also decided that legislative consistency means that they cannot accept &#147;furthering or promoting sustainable development&#148; in the MMO's duties, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said, the new power to further the three pillars of sustainable development will be critical to ensure that the MMO can make a real difference to our marine environment. As we have said, the MMO must not be just another quango in a sector already clogged with them. It needs to be a genuinely effective body with real teeth.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0905057000145"></a>Finally, the amendments ensuring that the Secretary of State's guidance on what is meant by sustainable development will be laid before Parliament are also extremely welcome. I am sure that not only Parliament but those implementing the policy will welcome the increased transparency and clarity. I again thank the Minister for listening to the House's concerns and congratulate him on bringing back amendments that address so many of our concerns. I hope that the rest of our proceedings can continue in an equally productive fashion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0905057000147"></a>I feel a bit like some sort of party-pooper, after the outbreak of harmony and congratulations that has gone around the Chamber. I am sorry to bring a discordant note but I am afraid that I have to. However, let me start on a good note and commend the Government&#146;s amendment on the chief scientific advisor. The points on full-time work made by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, were very well made.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_459"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 459</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90505-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0905057000148"></a>I think that the Minister would quite rightly expect me to fall away from him on Amendments 7 and 8. The statement about the MMO&#146;s primary objective fails what I call the &#147;small green man from Mars test&#148;&#151;that is, if a small green man arrived from Mars and read the provision, would he have a clue what on earth this body was there for? The provision continues to fail the &#147;small green man from Mars test&#148;. Not only does it say that the primary objective of the MMO is a duty,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000310"></a>&#147;to secure that the MMO functions are so exercised that the carrying on of activities by persons in the MMO&#146;s area is managed, regulated or controlled&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000242"></a>it goes on to say:</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000311"></a>&#147;with the objective of making a contribution to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90505-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0905057000149"></a>&#147;With the objective of making a contribution&#148; could involve an extremely small contribution. At some point the Government must get off the treadmill of having to perpetuate this definition because it exists in previous legislation, and move on to the more sensible one of asking these organisations, in language understandable by a small man from Mars, to &#147;further&#148; the achievements of sustainable development. It is a very simple statement that we should be expecting of all public bodies.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0905057000150"></a>After all, what is sustainable development? That is where I would differ on Amendment 8&#151;the one where, cunningly, the word &#147;furthering&#148; does appear. The amendment states:</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000312"></a>&#147;furthering any social, economic or environmental purposes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000243"></a>The whole point of sustainability is that it is not about social, economic or environmental purposes; it is about trying to achieve solutions that deliver on all three of these.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0905057000151"></a>I would place a rather large wager&#151;that is probably improper in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;to see whether the Minister could come up with any human endeavour whatever that does not fall into the category of either social, economic or environmental. I think he would be hard-pressed to find one. This amendment says that the MMO,</p>
<ul><a name="0905057000313"></a>&#147;may take any action which it considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905057000244"></a>doing anything that it should. So I am not convinced that we have made huge progress. I think that the Government need to get off this treadmill of the historic definition of what we expect our public bodies to do in order to further sustainable development, being so hideously tortuous and flabby that it is not understandable in any commonly understood sense of the word.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0905057000153"></a>Overall, I thank the noble Lords who have spoken for their general welcome for the amendments&#151;to some of which other noble Lords have put their names. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, both for his chairmanship of the Joint  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_460"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 460</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee and for the way that he has helped us to understand some of the problems with the original wording of Clause 2. Although it was probably technically correct, it struggled to get to the core to what the MMO is all about. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, thinks that we have not got there, but I think that we have made considerable progress.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0905057000154"></a>As for the treadmill and the tortuous drafting, I go back to our debate in Committee. I was a bit worried when the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, suggested that we were edging towards a definition of sustainability, but I will hold my nose and urge noble Lords to accept the government amendments. He will know that the reason for not defining sustainable development is that our understanding of what is sustainable is continually evolving.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0905057000155"></a>The UK Administrations have adopted the five shared principles, which set out a broad framework of sustainability: to live within environmental limits; to achieve a just society; to do so by means of a sustainable economy; good governance; and sound science. Those five principles have been expressed in our high-level objectives for the UK marine area. My amendment underpins that understanding of sustainable development in a way that can exist in legislation and which I hope will make clear to the MMO what is required, with the help of guidance and&#151;again as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has suggested&#151;with the opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny. He is right to say that it is very rare indeed for your Lordships&#146; House to reject a statutory instrument, but the fact that an SI has to come before Parliament ensures that very great care is taken before any SI is laid before your Lordships&#146; House. Clearly the same will be the case for the guidance to the MMO. The Government will listen very carefully to what Parliament has to say about the guidance; indeed, we would not move this amendment if that was not the intention.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0905057000156"></a>Again, I welcome the welcome given to Amendment 5 by noble Lords who have spoken. It must be considered in relation to the commitment that I made in Committee that a science advisory committee will be established; the two go together. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and other noble Lords, wished me to say something about the status of the chief scientific adviser and to say whether the appointment would be full-time. I cannot stand at the Dispatch Box and give an absolute guarantee that, for all time, the chief scientific adviser will be a full-time appointment because there might be circumstances in which that did not happen. However, I hope that I can answer the substantive questions: will this person be senior within the MMO, and will they be able to make a significant contribution to the work of the MMO? I have no hesitation whatever in saying yes. The very fact that this appointment appears in statute is a visible indication of that importance.</p>

<a name="90505-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0905057000157"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has huge experience in this area. My experience of the role of chief scientific advisers in a number of government departments in which I have now served leads me to say to your Lordships that the appointment of chief scientific advisers has been a huge advance in Whitehall in the advice that Ministers have received. In my experience,

I expect the chief scientific adviser to the MMO to have the same kind of relationship. I am very happy to make that point this afternoon.</p>

<a name="0905057000158"></a><b><a name="90505-0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0905057000436"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. I asked my question to try to establish what sort of commitment there was, obviously, but also to wonder whether someone involved in scientific research in other fields would be excluded from being appointed. It was nearly a double question; maybe I did not express it quite well enough. I would hate to think that somebody who would fulfil the role extremely well was employed somewhere else and was therefore unable to be considered. I was searching for that.</p>

I cannot go much further, but we would want the MMO to have discretion in that regard. It clearly needs to be able to appoint people or a person of the highest calibre and I would not want a situation such as the noble Baroness raises to get in the way of that. Equally, I am sure that we would want to be assured that the person appointed had the time and the ability to do what might be a very demanding job. To take the point raised earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, there is a great deal of research to be done and scientific evidence that we still need to have on the marine environment, so I would have thought that whoever was appointed would have not only a very important job but a busy one.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0905057000160"></a>On the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, we intend there to be not micromanagement but simply an appropriate check and balance on how the organisation might wish to go on with the terms and conditions that the schedule lays out. In view of recent events relating to salaries paid in quangos, while one wants to avoid micromanagement, one wishes to ensure appropriate accountability. The noble Baroness should not read anything more than that into it.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0905057000161"></a>I may have been too quick to shake my head when my noble friend said that I had used the word &#147;opinion&#148;. I apologise to him; I thought that he was referring to Amendment 9, whereas I used the word in relation to Amendment 18. However, I want to reassure him that that is not any old opinion but one that has been expressed after consideration of the evidence. I was speaking about opinion in that context, rather than saying, as he might have inferred, that any old opinion from anybody might have equal weight.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0905057000162"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has a great deal of experience and has raised an important matter about how green planning integrates with other development plans, including those on the land. She referred to the overlap. I hope to reassure her that, during the detailed process of developing marine plans, plan authorities will be under a legal obligation to secure compatibility with other plans that overlap, are adjacent to or have some relevance to marine plans&#151;including river basin and shoreline management plans and terrestrial plans&#151;thereby facilitating integration. That will, clearly, require the plan authorities to work with other regulators, planning bodies and Administrations.  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_462"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We expect the MMO to build sound relationships with terrestrial planners, local authorities and regional planning bodies. I can reassure her that we are working closely with the Local Government Association, regional planning bodies and the Department of Communities and Local Government to see how that relationship might work and, indeed, what lessons we might learn from terrestrial planning. Marine plans in coastal areas will often slightly overlap with the areas of jurisdiction of local authorities. Different kinds of plans in coastal areas already overlap, so this is not a new issue. I am confident that together we can make it work.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0905057000163"></a>We have already discussed devolution. Just as I have overall been encouraged by the approach taken by the devolved Administrations wishing to make this work together in an area that is partly the responsibility of the UK Government and partly the responsibility of the devolved Administrations, I have been encouraged, too, by the approach of local authorities, which are equally committed to making this work. However, I take the noble Baroness&#146;s point and I will make sure that this is given due consideration within my department and CLG. We will explore it further with the Local Government Association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0905057000164"></a>I turn to the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Perhaps I may say how relieved we are that, although he has ceased to be chairman of one body, he is now chairman of the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership. I pay tribute to the case that he made in Committee about science. He says that he is reassured that we see science as one of the underlying principles of sustainable development. I should also make it clear that we believe that the MMO needs to pursue an evidence-based approach to all its decision-making. As a decision-maker, the MMO is under a duty to take into account all relevant facts and matters, including those listed in new subsection (1B). It must also attach the appropriate weight to the different facts and matters taken into account.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0905057000165"></a>The type of evidence that the MMO will need to take into account will depend on the individual circumstances of each case and we have expanded on the kinds of matters that may be taken into account in Amendment 9. This should not be seen as an exhaustive list. Clearly, what is relevant in any particular case must be for the MMO to determine. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked the point of stipulating these matters and what weight they should be given. The fact is that putting these considerations in the Bill must in itself clearly give significant weight. The problem in the wording of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is that not everything will be relevant in every case. Our worry is about imposing a disproportionately onerous obligation on the MMO.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0905057000166"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s second point was about the use of the word &#147;appropriate&#148; as opposed to &#147;relevant&#148; in proposed new paragraph (c). We see our wording as allowing slightly wider discretion to cover anything that the MMO might take into account. Something might be of relevance, but of peripheral relevance, and might not be appropriate. We do not think that the distinction between the terms indicates a significant difference of approach, although I am not sure that I

He will understand the spirit in which I have tabled these amendments and why there should be some discretion, but I am happy to look into the detail to convince myself that we have got it absolutely right. I would be happy to discuss this matter further with the noble Lord between Report and Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0905057000168"></a>With great respect to the Minister, I suggest that the right approach by the Government to Amendment 9, which I do not think they have got quite right, is to make the distinction between relevance and weight. That is a classic planning approach, as I am sure the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would underline. While I foresee circumstances in which the Government might not wish to give any weight to a relevant matter, to introduce the word &#147;appropriate&#148; simply confuses things. However, he has kindly said&#151;to reassure his own interpretation of Amendment 9, which the Government have advanced&#151;that he will give it further thought between now and Third Reading. I am content to leave the matter for the present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0905057000170"></a>It should now be clear from the government amendment and the revised paragraph 20 that the MMO can indeed authorise a committee, sub-committee, member or employee to exercise any MMO function. The power is capable of repeated exercise, so if the MMO wanted, for example, to authorise a different committee to exercise a function, it could do so under that provision. Sub-paragraph (3) makes it clear that the MMO can still exercise that function itself, or get an employee to do it, notwithstanding the delegation of that function under sub-paragraph (1). In considering

We have based our drafting in this Bill on the provision in that Act. I hope we have, through the good offices of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who drew the attention of the Government and the House to this issue, clarified this issue. I beg to move.</p>

If I remember rightly, we discussed this at some inordinate length in Committee, probably late into the night. At the time I thought that I was having great difficulty in getting my point through to the Government, but clearly they were listening. The problem was that, as the paragraph was originally drafted, it was possible to delegate to two different committees at the same time, which could clearly cause confusion. I am very grateful to the Government for looking at it again, and for the common-sense and practical solution that they have found. Well done.</p>

It concerns the question of the MMO&#146;s relationship with coastal communities. We propose:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="0905057000270"></a>&#147;In pursuit of its general objective, the MMO shall endeavour to work closely with coastal communities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905057000245"></a>This was part of a much broader amendment moved in Committee by my noble friend Lord Tyler. I want to thank my noble friend for the work he put into this during the Committee stage on the days when I was not able to be here because I was otherwise engaged on another Bill. My noble friend has departed this life as far as this Bill is concerned and is now active on the Political Parties and Elections Bill. In Committee he said that he hoped the Minister would accept that the amendment would cover a &#147;lacuna in the Bill&#148;. I had to look up the word because I thought it had something to do with the lady of Laguna, but it turned out not to; I think my noble friend just meant that there is a gap. It is very important that the MMO works in close co-operation and, it is hoped, harmony or at least full and frank discussion, with coastal communities.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0905057000175"></a>We have noted several times that the MMO is unusual for a quango or body with a strong environmental element in that it deals with an area where there are no people. Most related organisations cover areas of the land where people live, work and play. That is not so clearly the case with the sea. Clearly, people work and play on and in the sea, but they do not live there permanently&#151;except along the coast. Where the sea meets the land is a crucial element of our discussions on the whole of the marine aspect of the legislation and the work of the MMO. It is extremely important that the MMO should work closely both with those living on the coast and their representatives.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0905057000176"></a>My noble friend made these points as part of a much longer debate that looked at many of the issues covered by the large group of amendments to Clause 2. It is clear from <I>Hansard</I> that he could not get any satisfactory answers, and the reason for tabling a further amendment today is to raise the issue again and hope that we can be given some today. Of course, parts of the Bill refer to different aspects of the work of the MMO as they relate to the coast and coastal communities while other parts, such as those dealing with IFCAs, relate to communities on the coast as  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_466"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 466</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>much as they do to the sea. However, we propose that it should be a fundamental principle that people living and working on the coast have to be recognised early on in the Bill at this high-level stage of setting up the MMO and setting out its objectives. If the MMO is not going to work closely with coastal communities, it will get itself into very serious trouble because it will not be able to do what it has to do. This should be in the Bill as a general principle. I beg to move.</p>

First I declare the interests that I declared in Committee: I am a member of various wildlife trusts, a member of the North Devon Yacht Club and vice-president of the Campaign for National Parks. My husband is a member of the Devon sea fisheries committee and a member of the Environment Agency coastal management group for the Bristol Channel area.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0905057000178"></a>I support what my noble friend said. Having reread the debate in Committee, I think there is a principle that the Government still need to put into the Bill; perhaps the Minister will tell me differently. The inshore sea area that the MMO will be responsible for&#151;I think the far offshore area will be far less contentious&#151;can be likened to common land. Some people have an economic interest in it, while some have an environmental interest and there is no owner, except that the Crown Estate owns the seabed. However, those coastal communities have, in many cases, worked over years to find a way forward. I am thinking, as the Minister knows, of estuary forums, where competing interests have had to be dealt with, some of which we discussed in Committee, such as recreational interests, say, and shellfish interests. Unless this is recognised in the Bill, all the positive work that coastal communities have done in balancing those different interests in the marine area will be lost. Unless the MMO is brought into that work very fundamentally, in statute, it will be an enormous backward step and those interests could start to compete with each other again. That will send different views to the MMO, making its life much more difficult. That is why I feel strongly that we should recognise the importance not of the statutory bodies, which we will talk about later&#151;my noble friend Lady Hamwee will talk, for example, about the role of statutory local authorities&#151;but of the more ephemeral idea of coastal communities, to which this amendment refers.</p>

Much of what the MMO seeks to achieve is, of course, of great interest to coastal communities, whether we are talking about harbours, fishing or seaside leisure. The prosperity of these communities will depend on them having good liaison and dialogue with the MMO. So obvious is this, however, that I am not sure that it is a necessary element to include at this early stage of the Bill&#151;there are places later in the Bill where it may be more relevant.</p>

I recall the debate in Committee and the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. When we were in Committee, we had a clash with the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill and we now have a clash with the Political Parties and Elections Bill. At one time I thought I might, as a Ministry of Justice Minister, be taking it through, but we have moved on to higher things with the marine Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0905057000181"></a>Rather like the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, I have no argument with noble Lords in their emphasis on the importance of coastal communities. I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, when he talked about the need for harmony but, if you cannot have harmony, at least have a full and frank debate. I agree with his point about the interface between the people living along the coast, the sea itself and the interests of people living in coastal areas. My concern is the implications of putting this in the Bill. It is the &#147;list&#148; argument: if you put something in legislation, you are in danger of excluding other interests. The amendment would amend the critically important Clause 2. The government amendments that we have agreed with the support of the House are, in a sense, the high-level duties and objectives. It would not be appropriate to add &#147;endeavour to work closely with coastal communities&#148;.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0905057000182"></a>It is, however, relevant to ask me how the MMO intends to work with the communities that noble Lords have spoken so eloquently about. Noble Lords will be aware of the vision for coastal management that my department has published recently entitled <I>A Strategy for Promoting an Integrated Approach to the Management of Coastal Areas in England</I>. The strategy makes it clear that we place a great deal of emphasis on the need to empower coastal communities. We want them to have a sense of ownership and stewardship within marine and coastal areas, and we think that that will greatly assist the MMO in the delivery of its functions and the overall objective of making a contribution to sustainable development. We think that marine planning will offer new opportunities for coastal regulators and communities to have a say in the way the marine environment is managed in the same way that they input now into land planning on the coast. Further, the statement of public participation issued by the MMO at the outset of development of each marine plan, which we might debate again, sets out how it intends to involve stakeholders and local communities at each stage. That will ensure that those with an interest will be clear about the process, decide what involvement they want to have and be able to become appropriately involved.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0905057000183"></a>I have no disagreement with noble Lords in their desire to ensure that coastal communities have a major input into the deliberations of the MMO and the way it works, but we have great reservations about singling out coastal communities and putting them into the Bill in Clause 2 in the way that the noble Lord has suggested.</p>

I was surprised by his use of the &#147;list&#148; argument. I am not sure which other items he thinks might be in the list. We are talking about the people who live in the coastal regions and along the coast. I do not consider that those people are just part of a list; they are pretty fundamental. I do not think that that argument applies; I am proposing not a list but something fundamental about the MMO&#146;s objectives and how it carries them out. It should work closely with coastal communities.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0905057000185"></a>The Minister said that this part of the Bill is about high-level duties. Working with coastal communities is a high-level duty. I am not saying that this amendment is perfect; if the Government do not like the words, I would be delighted if they went away and produced their own. Words are words. What matters is the meaning underneath those words, and that is what I am putting forward today.</p>

<a name="90505-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0905057000186"></a>I agree that the vision for coastal management&#151;the integrated strategy&#151;is an interesting, positive and hopeful document. I agree very much that there should be a sense of ownership and stewardship by coastal communities of what the Marine Management Organisation is doing in the inshore waters that affect them. That as why we are proposing this amendment. I do not understand why the Minister is resisting it being in the Bill since he is actually saying that he agrees with the intention behind it in almost every respect. I should like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<a name="0905057000189"></a><b><a name="90505-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0905057000454"></a>Lord Bridges:</b> My Lords, Amendment 19 incorporates the care of archaeological articles found on the seabed among the responsibilities of the Secretary of State. I should explain that I am not a professional archaeologist in any sense. My interest was first aroused when, as a student at Oxford, the all-embracing curriculum of the school of modern history was described in the university statutes as:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="0905057000289"></a>&#147;The history of Britain from the beginning to the present day&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905057000246"></a>My own special study was devoted to more recent history, in particular, the origins of the First World War, which was totally absorbing. However, there was some archaeology involved in the Anglo-Saxon and Roman periods of British history and subsequently I have belonged to the county archaeological societies of the three counties in which I have come to live: Surrey, Sussex and latterly Suffolk, where I have settled permanently on retirement.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0905057000190"></a>It so happens that one of my Suffolk neighbours in Orford, Mr Stuart Bacon, is seriously interested in locating treasures under the sea. He actually spent his career in the Royal Air Force, but he has opened a small museum in our village called Suffolk Underwater Studies. Some years ago, he located the wreck of a Spanish warship close inshore, which had got lost on the way home after its defeat in the Spanish Armada. The wreck included a rare 16th century Spanish cannon. With some difficulty, Mr Bacon raised this to the surface and transported it to his museum. It was too large to go through the door, so he chained it securely to the structure and began negotiations with the authorities in London so as to locate a national naval museum to which he could present it.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0905057000191"></a>While this was going on, at 7.30 one morning a convoy of official government vehicles arrived with a team who cut the chain and removed the cannon. I  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_470"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 470</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thought this to be an extremely rude, even high-handed, action and raised this matter at Question Time in this House on 14 March 2001, at cols. 841-2 of <I>Hansard</I>. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, for the Government agreed that the Royal Armouries did send a trailer and cut the chain, but there was no apology. More recently, I have been informed that the Crown Estate is now issuing licences for the extraction of aggregate within the 12-mile territorial limit. The official letter informing of this said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="0905057000290"></a>&#147;Surveys are carried out before dredging but...surveys often miss an ancient wreck&#148;</p>

<p><a name="0905057000247"></a>This seems a somewhat haphazard procedure.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0905057000192"></a>I also wish to draw attention to a significant recent development; namely, the discovery of an important British wreck in the Channel. This was evidently HMS &#147;Victory&#148;, launched in 1737. It is a major discovery. Previously it had been believed that the ship had come to grief close to the Channel Islands but the remains of the ship lie further west, scattered over a wide area and her fate now lies in the hands of the Disposal Services Authority, part of the Ministry of Defence. The ministry have a contract with an American company, Odyssey, which will dispose of the proceeds and might share some of them with the Ministry of Defence. Odyssey has American shareholders and is registered in New York. The contract should include archaeological supervision by the British Government but I do not know that that has happened. However, these arrangements do not comply with the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, which came into force in January 2009.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0905057000193"></a>Meanwhile, it seems likely that the fate of the valuable contents may be determined by the American courts. Among the items included in the cargo are apparently four tonnes of gold coins. This is the most important naval wreck to be discovered in recent years. Evidently, it is more important than HMS &#147;Mary Rose&#148;, which attracted much public attention a few years ago.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0905057000194"></a>For a fuller account of this remarkable event, I refer noble Lords to the current issue of <I>British Archaeology</I>&#151;the issue for May/June&#151;which is published by the Council for British Archaeology. I subscribe to that magazine and have arranged for photocopies of the most important pages to be available in our excellent Library, which is not a subscriber. I think that noble Lords will find it compelling reading, and I strongly recommend that Ministers responsible for the Bill study the article carefully as it will give them much food for thought. In particular, it would appear that the current commercial arrangement with Odyssey may conflict with the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0905057000195"></a>The amendment in my name is intended to give political responsibility for issues as significant as these to the Minister in charge of the department&#151;that well known if elusive personality, the Secretary of State. I suggest this because I believe that the issues involved are so large that the Minister in charge of the department should play a leading role in reaching decisions. The record to date, which I have cited, suggests that there has been little or no consideration of these issues at the political level. That is what I believe should happen in the future and that is the purpose of my amendment.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0905057000196"></a>I suggest that the Government would do well to consider these major issues before proceeding to the last stages of the Bill before us. I trust, therefore, that the Government will take a short period to reconsider the future of the Bill. Pending their reconsideration, I do not propose to press my amendment to a vote at present. I also suggest to the Government that there are other possible ways are proceeding. The first might be to recast the Bill in its entirety so that it concentrates on the issue of coastal paths, which seems to be its main political purpose. The remainder could certainly be put off until another day. We have already had a useful and thorough debate about the footpaths detail, so that would not be wasted.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0905057000197"></a>Alternatively, it might be decided to examine the whole issue of underwater treasure more thoroughly. Clearly, this is an important topic which Her Majesty&#146;s Government have not been able to concentrate on so far. I also venture that the creation of the administrative machinery to cope with the Bill in its present form will constitute a burden on the Exchequer which currently it is in no position to absorb. I shall await the Government&#146;s response with keen attention. Meanwhile, I repeat my request that the Minister should study the current issue of the magazine <I>British Archaeology</I>. Evidently, the Government have not had access to it so far. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0905057000199"></a>I very much agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, said in drawing attention to his amendment. I also attribute considerable importance to this area of our cultural heritage. In saying that, I should like to refer to a splendid document called <I>Archaeology Enriches Us All</I>, which, among other things, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="0905057000291"></a>&#147;Archaeology is key to understanding an irreplaceable store of human history, most with no written record and sometimes highly vulnerable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905057000248"></a>That is particularly true of the marine environment.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0905057000200"></a>I am glad to hear that the noble Lord does not intend to press the amendment today because the Government, in tabling Amendments 82 and 111 in this group, have acknowledged the importance of this area and have&#151;dare I say it?&#151;taken on board amendments tabled earlier by an all-party alliance comprising the noble Lords, Lord Howarth of Newport and Lord Low, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, and myself. The issue was discussed also by other noble Lords with considerable expertise and knowledge who are not able to be here today to record their agreement to the government amendments.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0905057000201"></a>I am very happy to acknowledge that, in Amendments 82 and 111, the Government have met many if not most of the concerns expressed in Committee. If it were not for these two amendments, there would be no explicit provision or requirement for marine plan authorities to keep historic or archaeological features under review, nor would there be any provision insisting that the authorities designating marine conservation zones have regard to the consequences for any sites in the area that are of historic or archaeological interest. However many times it is said  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_472"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Bill&#146;s main emphasis is to protect the natural environment, and however often we are asked to wait patiently for the heritage protection Bill&#151;which may or may not be mentioned in next year&#146;s Queen&#146;s Speech&#151;we nevertheless now have a specific reference point that enables a read-across to relevant existing legislation and to any future legislation which ties in our historic and cultural heritage, and marine archaeology considerations, with the new organisation and zoning arrangements created by the Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0905057000202"></a>The recently published high-level marine objectives document entitled <I>Our Seas&#151;</I><I>A</I><I> Shared Resource</I> uses the word &#147;heritage&#148; eight times, &#147;archaeology&#148; once and &#147;seascape&#148; three times. In the document originally put out for consultation, &#147;heritage&#148; was used on only four occasions and &#147;archaeology&#148; and &#147;seascape&#148; not once. The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, should be reassured by the fact that &#147;archaeology&#148; is included not only in the Bill but in high-level documents published outside the House. The final document also includes definitions of marine cultural heritage and seascape which we may hear a little more about later on Report.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0905057000203"></a>I thank the Minister and all those behind the scenes who have taken part in the discussions that have led to this happy state of affairs. I wish to mention specifically the Defra Minister in another place and the various NGOs, particularly English Heritage, whose input and support have been very significant. This is an important Bill and it should be as comprehensive as possible. As has been said, we send this Bill to another place in a better state. I thank the Government for listening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0905057000207"></a>I am very glad that the Government are able to bring forward amendments on an undoubtedly important matter. The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, have already indicated why it is important that the MMO gives due consideration to these matters. The noble Baroness has already referred to the Government&#146;s high-level marine objectives of 20 April which make it clear that people should appreciate the diversity of the marine environment, including its natural and cultural heritage. Let me make it clear that these high-level objectives underpin the development of the marine policy statement, which will then be applied in more detail in specific areas via the marine plans. So the high-level marine objective is important, which is why the references which the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, made to heritage and seascapes can be taken through the whole process that the Bill brings into play.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_473"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90505-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0905057000208"></a>I also make it clear that the kind of specific and comprehensive heritage protection that both noble Lords have intimated they would like to see deserves its own legislation. I know that there is disappointment that the Government have not yet been able to bring forward the heritage protection Bill in this parliamentary Session. However, we remain committed to that legislation and believe that it is the right vehicle for the comprehensive and vital protection of our historic, cultural and archaeological heritage.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0905057000209"></a>With that in mind, I have carefully considered our debate in Committee. We have had the opportunity to talk to colleagues in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. While we are not prepared to widen the scope of the Bill, we are clear that the provisions in the Marine and Coastal Access Bill should complement future heritage protection legislation. On reflection, while the Bill allows cultural heritage to be taken into account in decision-making, I believe that some references could be strengthened.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0905057000210"></a>I turn to my amendments before responding to that of the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. Amendment 82 seeks to clarify that the reference to culture in Clause 52(2)(a) includes historic and archaeological characteristics. The amendment essentially makes it clear that the historic and archaeological characteristics should be considered in the identification of marine plan areas and in the preparation and review of marine plans.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0905057000211"></a>Amendment 111&#151;which I have tabled to Clause 114, in Part 5&#151;is similarly intended to clarify that any social consequences referenced in subsection (7) include historic and archaeological consequences, so the Secretary of State may therefore take into account the historic and archaeological consequences of marine conservation&#146;s own site designations. I understand that noble Lords want to ensure that we are not only recognising and considering heritage in marine planning licensing and nature conservation, but that management of marine conservation zones will not undermine the work of bodies such as English Heritage which are tasked with protecting wrecks and other historic features.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0905057000212"></a>I therefore reassure noble Lords that the Government are extremely committed to ensuring that the nature conservation provisions are compatible with the vital licensing and management work carried out by English Heritage in the preservation of historic wrecks within UK waters.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0905057000213"></a>I draw the attention of the House to Clause 125(5), which specifically enables the MMO to make by-laws that allow for the issuing of permits under controlled circumstances. We expect that such permits will include the licensing of activities for the preservation or investigation of wrecks as well as permitting access to such sites. The MMO will be working closely with bodies such as English Heritage to agree this process, and this relationship is likely to be formalised through a memorandum of understanding, which will clarify how these respective roles will work effectively and efficiently to recognise both nature conservation and heritage interests. The amendments that I will move make a clear commitment to recognising our vital marine cultural heritage.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0905057000214"></a>Let me address the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. I was interested in his views and comments on HMS &#147;Victory&#148;, but I was somewhat  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_474"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taken aback by the suggestion that we should simply not deal with those aspects of the Bill that do not relate to coastal access. After our 11 days in Committee, this House is well able to come to a view on the totality of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0905057000215"></a>The amendment proposes that the objectives that the Secretary of State may set for the MMO should include the protection of items of archaeological interest on the seabed. As I have set out, in seeking to achieve its objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development, the MMO will be guided by the policies of the marine policy statement and, ultimately, by marine plans. This means that archaeological protection will be one of the many factors taken into account by the MMO when it is making decisions, so it is unnecessary to include this specific requirement in Clause 3. It will be a familiar argument to noble Lords that to do so would actually unbalance the MMO&#146;s objective and imply that this factor is more important than other factors. The amendment would widen the focus of the MMO and the Bill beyond what we think is best both for the Bill and for future heritage protection legislation.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0905057000216"></a>Although I do not think that Part 1 is the appropriate place to reference archaeology, heritage can be considered in the drafting of marine plans, in the licensing of marine activities and in considering the social and economic consequences of marine conservation zone designations within 12 nautical miles. I stress that, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the UK cannot make legislation for the protection of archaeological and historical objects beyond 12 nautical miles, except where naval vessels and other vessels owned or operated by a state and used only on government non-commercial service are concerned.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0905057000217"></a>Clause 112(2), when read with Clause 66(1)(a), clearly provides that the marine licensing authority must have regard to the protection of any site that is of historic or archaeological interest when considering applications for a marine licence. Although we will not be able to license the removal of underwater cultural heritage directly beyond 12 nautical miles&#151;we will be using the exemptions order in Clause 72 to ensure that we are compliant with the UN convention in this regard&#151;this will provide some significant protection to wrecks beyond 12 nautical miles from other types of licensable marine activities that could otherwise damage such sites.</p>

<a name="90505-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0905057000218"></a>In line with the marine licensing provisions, and following reflection on our debate in Committee, marine planning and nature conservation powers can be strengthened in the way in which my amendments seek to do. While I suspect that the amendments do not go as far as the noble Lord would like, I think that they meet the general concerns that were expressed in Committee. I hope that this explanation at this point in our discussion will be helpful.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, has noted, the government amendments make it clear that historic and archaeological characteristics can be considered in the preparation and review of marine plans and when considering the consequences of marine conservation zone designations. My noble friend has also again placed on record the Government&#146;s commitment to the protection of marine heritage and has stated that the nature conservation provisions of Clause 125(5) will be compatible with the licensing and management work that English Heritage carries out in the preservation of historic wrecks. His suggested memorandum of understanding between the MMO and English Heritage would be very useful if it clarifies their respective responsibilities. The only note of caution that I would strike is that, if we are to have by-laws passed by the Marine Management Organisation and licences issued by the DCMS, I hope that all concerned will do their best to ensure that there is the minimum of bureaucracy and complexity and that the system is navigable by the people who need to use it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0905057000221"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, told the House that the context of these amendments and assurances is the new document that the Government have published, <I>Our Seas&#151;A Shared </I><I>Resource</I>:<I> High-Level Marine Objectives</I>. It is good to read in that document that among the high-level marine objectives is the conservation of the cultural marine heritage and to see definitions of &#147;marine cultural heritage&#148; and &#147;seascapes&#148;. Following the assurance that my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham gave in Committee on 23 February, at col. 48, and what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said today, I am confident that the marine policy statement&#151;the overarching statement of policy&#151;will set out the Government&#146;s policy on safeguarding the marine environment, including the cultural and historic marine environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0905057000222"></a>The amendments and commitments give us the essence of what we have sought. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, indicated, there are problematic issues surrounding the conservation of the marine heritage beyond 12 nautical miles. In the extremely important case of HMS &#147;Victory&#148; described by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, is the Minister in conversation with colleagues at the Ministry of Defence, which should have competence in this matter given that HMS &#147;Victory&#148; was a naval warship? I hope that the MoD is taking seriously its responsibility to ensure that a commercial and predatory firm of divers is not able to loot this extraordinarily important part of our naval heritage.</p>

<a name="09050530000001"></a><b><a name="90505-0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09050530000413"></a>Lord Howarth of Newport:</b> My Lords, I appreciate what my noble friend has said. I thank him, my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham, Mr Huw Irranca-Davies and the ministerial team for being so accessible and willing to listen and for responding so constructively&#151;I am most grateful to them. I also thank and congratulate English Heritage officials, who briefed a number of us with precision, lucidity and very good judgment.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09050530000002"></a>My final point has already been suggested by others. Could we please now have the heritage protection Bill? That would much more fairly and squarely deal with the important issues addressed with such eloquence and passion by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. The debates that we have had on the heritage aspects of this Bill have been more anxious and uncertain than they would have been had the heritage protection Bill been proceeding in parallel through Parliament.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09050530000003"></a>This Bill is primarily about issues concerning the natural environment, whereas the heritage protection Bill is the appropriate primary vehicle for protection of the marine historic environment. As my noble friend Lord Hunt said, there must be complementarity between the two, and I am grateful to Defra for the strenuous efforts that it has made to ensure that there is that complementarity. However, in the absence of what should have been the parallel Bill, the regime for which we are legislating will be lopsided.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09050530000004"></a>I was pleased to hear my noble friend Lord Hunt reaffirm that the Government remain committed to the heritage protection Bill, but why do we not have it? It has been frustrating to be told repeatedly that the House of Commons during the past several weeks has been twiddling its legislative thumbs without enough to do. We know that the heritage protection Bill has all-party support&#151;at least, I am assured by senior, responsible people in both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties that they support the essence of the measure. It has had pre-legislative scrutiny. Why can we not, even now, at this late stage of the Session, bring it into the House of Lords, make some progress with it and, if we cannot complete scrutiny of it in this Session, carry it over to the next Session? As I understand it, there is no procedural objection. Of course, that would need to be agreed by the usual channels, but, given that everyone thinks that it is a valuable measure, what difficulty should there be?</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09050530000005"></a>If we fail to do that, how will the heritage protection Bill get on the statute book? The next Session, the last of this Parliament, must be a short Session. It is difficult to be confident that the Bill would take its place in the first Session of the next Parliament, when it is all too liable to be crowded out by Bills emanating from big manifesto pledges. It would be a valuable thing to get it on the statute book. It would be enormously helpful for the heritage sector and local government. I hope that it will be possible for the usual channels to have constructive discussion about that and to agree that we should proceed with no further delay with the heritage protection Bill to support the now excellent heritage protection elements within the Marine and Coastal Access Bill.</p>

<a name="09050530000006"></a><b><a name="90505-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09050530000414"></a>Lord Greenway:</b> My Lords, in speaking briefly to the amendments, I should declare an interest as chairman of the World Ship Trust, which is dedicated to encouraging the preservation of historic ships. I say &#147;ships&#148; rather than &#147;wrecks&#148;, but we are nevertheless interested in what is brought forth from wrecks discovered under the sea. I agree in many ways with what the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, just said. The proposed heritage protection Bill is certainly the right vehicle to deal with this subject, but I am delighted that the Government have made this concession in their amendments, which will at least act as a stop-gap until such time as the heritage protection Bill is brought forward.</p>

I should make it clear that under existing law&#151;I refer in particular to HMS &#147;Victory&#148;&#151;although HMS &#147;Victory&#148; was in international waters, the fact that it was a British vessel was recognised by all concerned, so we had the right to dispose of the remains of the ship in the way that we thought best. I was trying to suggest in that part of my remarks that no proper attention was devoted to that by the Government, who simply allowed the Ministry of Defence to sell it off for what it could get to the United States. That does not seem to me to be an appropriate treatment of the most historic wreck belonging to this country found for a very long time.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09050530000008"></a>I also suggest that, in the other legislation referred to, it would be helpful if more specific reference were made to exactly what we mean by the marine environment. For a lot of people, that will mean fish. The idea that there will be treasures down there that people are not free to raid needs to be explored. Living where I do, it is clear to me that there are a lot of foreign vessels snooping around our shores looking for what they can find. I have yet to see a vehicle from the Ministry of Defence or anyone else keeping an eye on what is going on. We do that where we are. There is an enormous gap before good intentions are transferred into something more concrete. That was my only motive in moving the amendment. I hope that we can be a little more specific; that would give a great deal of encouragement to those of us who care. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That is another indication that a good working relationship has been established.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09050530000010"></a>The licensing of English fishing vessels operating out of Scottish ports and Scottish fishing vessels operating out of English ports is an administrative convenience currently undertaken on a reciprocal basis by Scottish Ministers and the Secretary of State, although, in practice, the Secretary of State&#146;s licensing function in England is carried out by the Marine and Fisheries Agency, an executive agency of Defra. Unlike the Northern Ireland Act and the Government of Wales Act, the Scotland Act has no provision enabling Scottish Ministers to enter into agency arrangements with any public body to exercise functions on their behalf. Specific provision for that is therefore required in the Bill to enable the Marine Management Organisation, as a non-departmental public body, to enter into those arrangements with Scottish Ministers to maintain the status quo.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09050530000011"></a>Consequential Amendments 20, 23 and 36 have been made to delete subsections (2), (7) and (8) and Clause 14(3)(b), which are no longer required. In addition, Amendment 23 replaces subsection (6) with new subsections (6) to (8) appropriately to convey the scope of the transitional provisions that may be required when the MMO comes into being. The clause provides that licences already granted by the Secretary of State will, once the Bill is commenced, be treated as having been granted by the MMO. The amendment ensures that the same principle applies to licences that have been varied, suspended or revoked by the Secretary of State before the Bill is commenced; such licences will be treated as if varied, suspended or revoked by the MMO. Similarly, any application for a licence made to the Secretary of State that has not already been determined or withdrawn by the time that the MMO is established will be treated as an application to the MMO. I beg to move.</p>

It is good to hear the Minister explain that, because of the lack of this agency ability under the Scotland Act, he is bringing Scottish powers into line with those of all the other devolved Administrations. It is certainly a nice thought that Scottish fishing boats in England will be able to get a Scottish licence, as it is that English boats in Scotland will be able to get an English licence. The mind turns to how far flexibility can reach and whether that will have any relevance for Spanish boats that have obtained an English or Scottish quota licence. It might be interesting for the House to know whether the Minister can see such an arrangement being extended to other countries. Does that mean in effect that every skipper can just nominate from which authority he wishes to obtain a licence?</p>

Before I come to that, perhaps I could give the background to reciprocal licensing of fishing vessels. Normally, the port letters and numbers given to a fishing vessel on original registration remain  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_479"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with it for life. Thus the registration of a fishing vessel originally registered in Penzance will start with the letters PZ, while that of one registered in Peterhead will start with PH. In a similar way to car registration, the licence number of a fishing vessel remains the same when the vessel is sold on. Therefore, there are now a number of fishing boats that were originally registered in an English port but which now belong to Scottish owners and operate out of Scottish ports, and vice versa.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09050530000014"></a>From a practical point of view, it makes more sense for vessels to be administered and licensed by the port office close to the port out of which they fish. A Scottish vessel was defined in the devolution settlement as a fishing boat whose entry in the register specifies a port in Scotland as the port to which the vessel is to be treated as belonging. I am sure that the noble Duke will remember our debating that point during the devolution Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09050530000017"></a>Because of the way in which that was so defined, it is necessary for Scottish vessels, or those originally registered in Scotland, that operate out of English ports to be licensed by the Secretary of State on behalf of Scottish Ministers and for English vessels, or those whose original port of registration was in England, to be licensed by Scottish Ministers on behalf of the Secretary of State. This is a sensible approach; we just need to make sure that, in legislative terms, we can carry on doing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09050530000018"></a>The noble Duke asked about Spanish vessels rather than Spanish customs. This legislation is not a way in which we can encompass Spanish vessels in the licensing regime. They are licensed by the Spanish Government.</p>

I am consciously returning to a topic that was broached by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, on our third day in Committee. His amendment was specifically concerned with the direction or guidance to be issued to the Marine Management Organisation, on which score he asked that consultation be held. In his answer, the Minister did not deny the need for consultation but merely relied on invoking normal good practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09050530000021"></a>I notice from correspondence received a couple of hours ago from the Minister in another place that the Marine Management Organisation will be given certain functions within the Scottish inshore area and that some legislation coming from the MMO will apply in that area. It seems to me that one requires something beyond normal good practice to cover these situations and it would be clearer to all if that was stated on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

Also relevant is my membership of the Commission on Scottish Devolution, set up by resolution of the Scottish Parliament and supported by Her Majesty&#146;s Government, which is looking at devolved/reserved boundaries; indeed, I think that today it was taking evidence from the Scottish Environment Link on the respective marine Bills that we and the Scottish Parliament are dealing with.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09050530000023"></a>I generally support the amendment moved by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. In Committee, we came back to the issue of devolved and reserved functions a number of times to try to pin down just which functions still remained the responsibility of UK Ministers and the MMO and would involve the Secretary of State or the MMO undertaking responsibilities in the Scottish inshore area. I do not think that we totally pinned them down. Defence is an obvious issue and international shipping and responsibilities for rights of passage would be another. In areas such as the Pentland Firth, where a considerable amount of renewable marine energy is anticipated, there could well be occasions when it was important to have proper co-ordination between Marine Scotland, as established by the Scottish Government, and the MMO. Therefore, it would be welcome to have some obligation beyond the normal courtesies to consult where there would be interaction in the Scottish inshore water in these circumstances. I think that the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, has raised an important point and I look forward with interest to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

Of course I fully understand their anxieties. They wish to ensure that, where the

The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, identified not an exhaustive list of functions, but several clear areas where it might be necessary for the MMO, working on behalf of the Government in respect of UK-wide powers, to undertake a function within the inshore waters.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09050530000025"></a>We had some extensive discussions on the devolution issues during our earlier debates. I emphasise that, in preparing this Bill, the Government were concerned to secure the full support of all four Administrations. I want to assure the House that what we have in the Bill in this respect has the full support of those Administrations. We have not had representation from any of the Administrations that they want anything on the face of the Bill that gives additional expression to what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, indicated would be good established practice. That is what the four Administrations are content with.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09050530000026"></a>I buttress this remark by giving a full assurance that the Secretary of State will not permit the MMO to operate within the devolved Administrations&#146; inshore regions without prior consultation with the appropriate Ministers or Administration. It goes without saying that this is best practice for neighbouring Administrations working together, and that the devolved Administrations understand how it will work. I re-emphasise that point today from the Dispatch Box. There is therefore not a great deal between the two supporters of the amendment and the Government. We are out to emphasise, as they have, the importance of such consultation taking place. I emphasise that the devolved Administrations are happy with the Bill, so it will be appreciated that we do not see the benefit of placing such a provision in the Bill. I might also add that we are not totally convinced that, if it were in the Bill, this would be the place to put it, but that is a different matter. I hope that, with that statement, the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, will feel able to withdraw his amendment with some confidence.</p>

He did at least from the Dispatch Box say exactly what I said should be put into the Bill. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, has seen the letter that came today from the Minister in the other place and which extends a little the list that the noble Lord read out. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050530000153"></a>&#147;an order under section 104 of the Scotland Act ... will be taken forward at Westminster to ensure that Scottish marine plans only bind UK public authorities once they have been approved by UK Ministers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050530000076"></a>However, it goes on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050530000154"></a>&#147;the Scottish Government have offered up a greater say to the UK Government in the inshore region on planning and conservation designation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050530000077"></a>Certain elements are coming in that complicate the area, but I will consider what the Minister has said. I will be interested to hear him say where he thinks an amendment such as this should go, but in the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09050530000029"></a>What the Minister had to say about working with local authorities in our brief discussion on Amendment 18 and the overlap in area between coastal local authorities and the MMO was very welcome. He talked about working with the Local Government Association, which has a coastal authorities special interest group. My noble friend Lady Miller says that I referred to it in Committee as a special needs group. If I did, I certainly did not mean it in quite that way.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09050530000030"></a>Clause 16 deals with bodies that are eligible to have a delegation from the MMO. My amendment would add local authorities to the list. The list includes harbour authorities. Some harbour authorities are also local authorities, but I understand that not all coastal local authorities are harbour authorities. This is not a very dramatic or wide amendment. Under Clause 15(1), the delegation requires the approval of the Secretary of State. Clause 17 precludes the delegation of a function that is not compatible with a local authority function, so any suggestion that the amendment would give local authorities far too wide a remit would be incorrect. Clause 18 requires the delegation to have a time limit.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09050530000031"></a>The local authorities that are coastal authorities undertake land-use planning down to mean low water and prepare their local development frameworks accordingly. This overlaps with the marine planning function, extending to mean high water. Certain local authorities have by-law-making powers that extend offshore, such as zoning areas for water sports, and certain local authorities deliver coastal protection measures that involve the development between the mean high and low water marks and sometimes even below mean low water.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09050530000032"></a>In Committee, the Minister said in a debate on another amendment that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050530000155"></a>&#147;there will be occasions when, for reasons of resources, expertise or geographical remit, another body is better placed to perform a function on the MMO&#146;s behalf&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/09; col. 1758.]</ul>
<p><a name="09050530000078"></a>It would therefore be entirely appropriate to include local authorities in the list. I appreciate that if they are not included, the Secretary of State can add them because he can add eligible bodies by order, but if it is appropriate for them to be eligible it is appropriate now and we should say so from the start.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09050530000033"></a>My Amendment 63, which would amend Schedule 5, would require consultation with representatives of coastal local authorities, although not necessarily with every single one, during the preparation of the consultation draft of the marine policy statement and the finalising of that statement, for the reasons that I just gave in speaking to Amendment 39. I beg to move.</p>

I remember drawing on my experience of Holbeach Marsh and the Wash and of the large proportion of my wife&#146;s county council division that lay under water at high tide. It is clear as you climb the sea bank and at low tide take in the wide expanse of marsh, mudflats and sea that it is a marine area. It is very properly heavily protected and just the sort of coastal area to be part of the Bill&#146;s purpose.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09050530000035"></a>However, I remember being impressed by the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, who is not in her place at the moment, who introduced a different point of view. I thought of the inter-tidal areas of beaches and the current interests and responsibilities of local authorities in those areas. I had in mind in large terms Brighton beach and other similar places in which the foreshore is an area covered by local authorities in which they have interests and for which they issue by-laws. I therefore welcome the Government&#146;s amendments, which ensure that harbour authorities positions&#146; are properly regarded. Further to that, however, I support the idea behind the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, which would ensure that the MMO found ways of reaching joint agreements with local authorities to facilitate the proper use and maintenance of inter-tidal areas where they have a strong interest to do so.</p>

It is our intention to include in the list of eligible bodies in Clause 16 all local authorities that would have a legitimate expectation of carrying out functions on behalf of the MMO. We therefore included the sea fisheries committees&#151;they may still exist when the MMO is established&#151;and those local authorities which are also harbour authorities. There is no question that we recognise the significance of local authorities to those responsibilities, while Clause 16 also includes a power allowing the Secretary of State to add bodies to the list in the future, should that be deemed necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09050530000038"></a>However, it is, surely, inappropriate to add all local authorities to the list of eligible bodies in Clause 16, because it is pretty obvious that not all local authorities

<p><a name="09050530000079"></a>to add bodies to the list,</p>
<ul><a name="09050530000157"></a>&#147;unless satisfied that at least one of the purposes or functions of the body ... to be added to the list is, or is related to or connected with, a marine function&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050530000080"></a>I would have thought that that was clear enough; we only want those local authorities involved which could conceivably have a marine function and, therefore, some relationship with the MMO.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09050530000039"></a>During the debate in Committee on Clause 20, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, were keen to enable to enable local authorities to work together jointly when carrying out functions delegated to them by the MMO. They supported the flexibility that this type of arrangement would offer the relevant local authorities. I emphasise that we want see that in the operation of Clause 20, but that clause refers specifically to local authorities that are harbour authorities. We have, of course, reflected on the matters that have been raised about joint working, but have decided that we do not wish to restrict local authorities which are also harbour authorities from working together on a particular function, if it is appropriate for them to do so.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09050530000040"></a>We have, therefore, tabled Amendments 42 to 46 to make that clear. They would alter Clause 20 to allow joint working by local authorities that are harbour authorities to take place. The amendments have been drafted to allow harbour authorities that are operating executive arrangements to work jointly, as well as those authorities that are not. As a result of changes to Clause 20, we have also tabled minor and technical amendments to Clause 19; Amendment 41 is needed to correct the reference to Clause 20 in Clause 19, and is therefore purely technical. I hope, then, that it will be appreciated that we took on board the arguments in Committee about joint working, and that these amendments help to make that clear.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09050530000041"></a>I turn to the much more substantive Amendment 63, which gives us a further opportunity to restate our intention that local authorities in coastal areas will be fully involved in the marine planning process. The amendment would make coastal local authorities statutory consultees in,</p>
<ul><a name="09050530000158"></a>&#147;the preparation of the consultation draft&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09050530000081"></a>and when settling the final text. We have previously explained our reasons for not including any statutory consultees for the marine planning process, and the House will surely be relieved to hear that I do not intend to reiterate those arguments; however, I want to give a firm reassurance on the involvement of local authorities in that process.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09050530000042"></a>First, the statement of public participation will set out how, when and where local communities and stakeholders will be involved in the marine planning process. We intend that that process will be fully participatory, involving as fully as possible all who want to be involved. It is vital for the success of  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_488"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 488</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>marine planning that local knowledge and expertise is used throughout, a point much emphasised in Committee. The need for compatibility with terrestrial plans&#151;another point that was greatly emphasised&#151;means that there can be absolutely no doubt; relevant local authorities must be consulted in the marine planning process, starting with the marine policy statement.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09050530000043"></a>In addition, paragraph 8 of Schedule 6 enables the marine plan authority to,</p>
<ul><a name="09050530000159"></a>&#147;seek advice or assistance from any body or person&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09050530000082"></a>with</p>
<ul><a name="09050530000160"></a>&#147;particular expertise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050530000083"></a>A local authority is clearly such a body and, in our guidance to the Marine Management Organisation, we will set out how we expect it to work closely with representatives from local authorities as part of a focused advisory group, as well as more generally. The group would assist the planning team throughout the process of creating the marine plan.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09050530000044"></a>In developing the marine planning proposals we have worked closely with the Local Government Association special interest group on coastal issues for nearly three years. To help us to understand how and through what mechanisms we can enable local authorities to be fully involved throughout the marine planning process and the issues around this, including the resource and capacity demands for their involvement, we recently ran a marine planning workshop in partnership with the Local Government Association special interest group. This event was well supported by 35 local authorities and we are considering what further work we may need to take forward. We are endeavouring to engage closely with all 135 local authorities around the coast, so we have also been working with the Coastal Chairs Group, government offices and the regional development agencies coastal network.</p>

<a name="90505-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09050530000045"></a>I hope, therefore, that I have given evidence of the fact that far from the Government neglecting the interests and the rightful role of local authorities with a coastal interest, we have been engaged with them over a period of time in preparing this Bill. They know that we intend to include them in that part of the planning process, but we do not think that it is sensible to put the totality of local authorities in the Bill. Therefore, I hope the noble Baroness will think that we have responded to her amendments and the debate in Committee with thoroughness, and that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

The marine policy statement is the basis for the marine plan, which is why I felt that it was important to raise it in the context of recognising the points in Schedule 6. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor. The first of my amendments is merely about eligibility. It is not about delegation. If the MMO sought to delegate a function to an entirely inappropriate, completely landlocked local authority, I do not think that the local authority would accept the delegation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09050530000047"></a>The Minister criticised my first amendment because it would apply to all local authorities. He hinted that perhaps I should have said &#147;coastal&#148; local authorities. But if the Government had wanted coastal local

It is in the nature of a probing amendment and a word from the Minister will be sufficient reassurance, provided, of course, that it is the right word. The Minister will recall the debate that we had on Clause 23 in Committee. My concern is that when the MMO commissions research under subsection (1)(b), it does so according to a procedure that will enable the appropriate decision-maker in the body to choose the right person or research body for the right task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09050530000049"></a>My confidence that this will be the case is reinforced both by the prospective insertion into the Bill of a chief scientific adviser and by the Minister&#146;s undertaking to have a scientific advisory committee included as part of government guidance to the MMO. I am sure that the MMO will follow such guidance. Nevertheless, it would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that he would expect such procedures to be established by the MMO so that, if it is in the position of having to spend valuable money on research, that money will go to the person or organisation best qualified to use it productively in the public interest.

I think I can give the word that the noble Lord is seeking; I think it is &#147;yes&#148; and I am happy to say that.

<a name="90505-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09050530000051"></a>We expect the MMO to forge good and active relations with many of the centres of scientific excellence. Those include&#151;there is always a danger in listing only some of them but I will take the risk today because I

All of those organisations and others are staffed by experts in the field of marine research. I would expect the MMO to have a robust approach to commissioning research from organisations that are appropriately qualified, with people who are qualified and best able to make a contribution. I hope the noble Lord is happy with those assurances.</p>

<a name="90505-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09050530000052"></a>I turn now to my Amendment 48 to Clause 23. Noble Lords will recall that in Committee we had a very interesting discussion about the MMO&#146;s power to undertake research. Some noble Lords were concerned that, as currently drafted, subsection (2) would require the MMO to disclose all results of research to any person on request, including those results that may be of a sensitive nature and the disclosure of which could have unwanted implications. I have reflected on those concerns and tabled Amendment 48 to address them. Let me make it clear that, as a non-departmental public body, the MMO should make available to the public as much information as possible and that it is required to have a publication scheme under the Freedom of Information Act. We intend the MMO to act in an open and transparent manner. It is entirely appropriate that the MMO should make available the results of any research that it undertakes. My department has a publication scheme for research projects, the results of which are publicly available on the departmental website. The way in which the MMO operates should be no different from that at all.</p>

<a name="90505-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09050530000053"></a>However, while we want the MMO to make as much information as possible publicly available, there might be occasions when it is not appropriate to disclose the results of research. In Committee noble Lords instanced some of those occasions. For example, they might arise because information includes personal data or, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, suggested earlier, because the information is commercially sensitive or affects British interests. In such cases the MMO might reasonably wish to keep the information confidential. It would be possible to keep this type of information confidential under an exemption from the Freedom of Information Act 2000 or an exception from the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. I accept that that is not explicit in the clause as drafted. As a result, I have decided that it would be appropriate to bring Amendment 48 to your Lordships so that it tightens the clause to make it clear that any requirement for the MMO to make available its results or research would be subject to any exemptions or exceptions under two pieces of access to information legislation, namely the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. The MMO would also not have to disclose information that was prohibited from disclosure under any other Act in the future.</p>

<a name="90505-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09050530000054"></a>I should say clearly again that, having tabled this amendment in light of the concerns expressed in Committee, our overall stance is that the MMO will wish to make as much information as possible publicly

The mapping, collating and analysis being carried out will be of great benefit to all users of the marine environment, fishermen as well as conservationists. However, it is not just Cefas that is involved in this work. As my noble friend said, there are research laboratories in universities as well as private firms seeking to produce more effective equipment and develop new techniques. All sources of information must be exploited if we are to manage our seas effectively. I thank the Minister for tabling his amendment and thus meeting our concerns.</p>

I hope that the Minister will appreciate that with these amendments, we are all trying to achieve the same thing: the statutory role of the MMO as an adviser to the IPC for decisions that will impact on the marine area it has responsibility for. I am sure that the drafting of these alternatives could be improved, but it is always tricky to amend previous legislation. However, I hope that the substance is clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09050530000059"></a>It may be surprising to the Minister that we have returned in such force to this group. After all, we are close to the Government&#146;s own position on the point. In Committee, we tabled much stronger amendments which sought to insist that the MMO should take complete control of these decisions. I hope the Minister will appreciate our search for an acceptable compromise. We still oppose the carve-out of such important decisions from the MMO because that damages not only its position as the principal management body for the marine environment, but also achievement of a consistent policy of sustainable development. In this I believe that I am supported by noble Lords to my right and many outside organisations concerned with the effective implementation of the Government&#146;s marine policy. However, it has been made clear to us that the Government do not intend to move on putting the MMO in overall charge of all planning decisions at sea. Of course, with the numbers in this House we probably could have won the day, but only for a short time, and I have been persuaded that seeking to insist on such a policy, only to see it rejected in another place, would be counterproductive for the smooth passage of a Bill that we are all keen to see made into law.</p>

This amendment therefore represents the bare minimum of what we would find acceptable and is not, I believe, very different from the Government&#146;s own intentions. We seek to put in the Bill that the MMO must be a statutory adviser or consultee and that the IPC must not only seek the advice of the MMO, but where its advice and recommendations are not taken, justification for not adopting them must be published. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, but if not, that he will be able to come back on Report with his own no doubt better drafted version. I beg to move.</p>

Our amendments amount to something very similar to that moved by the noble Earl so I do not need to go through the detail, but I will say that we believe that there is a qualitative difference between being a statutory adviser and a statutory consultee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09050530000063"></a>During the passage of what is now the Planning Act, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, talked about the MMO. I have to say that at the time, while I could understand at a certain level what he was saying, I did not appreciate the deep and instinctive way he put his point forward; I did not understand the depth of it, but I do now. He was absolutely right. I probably said at the time that he was right, but the comments were perhaps less passionate than his. We are very passionate about this because we want to see these systems working well, so these amendments are intended to be genuinely constructive in that they do not seek to obstruct what the Government are doing, and constructive not just in regard to this Bill but also with that which has already been passed; that is, the Planning Act.</p>

We all want the Marine Management Organisation to be the single planning body for the marine environment and, to be honest, had we ganged together, we could have driven that through the House. That would have been a sensible outcome. But the Government appear to be very against it, so this group of amendments attempts to ensure that the MMO and the IPC really do stand shoulder to shoulder rather than as a superior and an inferior body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09050530000065"></a>The reason I support Amendments 50 and 51 is that they lay out clearly that the MMO should be a statutory adviser to the IPC in development consents for those projects in energy generation and the larger harbour schemes that the IPC is responsible for, not just for land that has an impact on the marine  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_497"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>environment, which I think is the purport of Amendment 49. Advice needs to be given on individual projects and not just on statements or plans. I am sure the Minister will tell us that the Government are currently consulting on the list of statutory consultees for the national policy statements, and I welcome that within the consultation it states that the MMO, once established, will be included as a statutory consultee along with the Secretary of State on those statements.</p>

<a name="90505-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09050530000066"></a>I also welcome the Government&#146;s proposals that, currently subject to consultation, the MMO will be on the list of statutory consultees that the applicant must consult before submitting an application to the IPC. However, there is a difference between being a statutory consultee for the MPS or for an applicant for an individual application and being a consultee to the IPC on the range of issues that it will be dealing with that impact on the marine environment. Amendments 50 and 51 take that forward. I hope that the Government will recognise that this simply brings the IPC and the MMO shoulder to shoulder in an amicable way, rather than as a superior and a subordinate organisation. A statutory consultee makes the MMO just one of a bunch; being a statutory adviser, which implies that advice has to be sought and reasons stated when it is not taken, is appropriate for a body that needs to have similar powers and similar clout to the IPC.</p>

I recognise that the intent of the amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, and, indeed, those of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is to get the right relationship between the IPC and MMO and on that basis, they are very much appreciated. I know that those of us who debated this matter on the Planning Bill and in Committee on this Bill have different views about the role of the IPC in relation to consents above 100 megawatts. We debated the principle when the Planning Bill went through and also discussed the potential role of the MMO, but of course, that was before legislation had been brought before Parliament, so, in a sense, it was a discussion in anticipation. On the role of the IPC, we think it right that, for applications that come within the definition of &#147;nationally significant&#148;, the decision should be made by the IPC. However, I also want to make it clear that we consider that the MMO will have a very important role to play throughout the consideration of nationally significant infrastructure projects, both in, or which are capable of affecting, the marine area&#151;one should mention ports as well as wind farm developments. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that we want to make the arrangements proper and appropriate; we share the view of all noble Lords on that.</p>

<a name="90505-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09050530000068"></a>We see the MMO as being involved at three key stages of the development of nationally significant infrastructure projects that are within the marine area. First, marine developers must consult the MMO before they make any application to the IPC. That should ensure that the MMO is fully engaged at the start of the application process. Secondly, the MMO will be a statutory party as part of the IPC&#146;s examination of marine projects and our intention had been to enshrine these roles in secondary legislation. Thirdly&#151;and very importantly&#151;where the IPC grants consent in the  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_498"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 498</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>marine area for a development to take place, it will grant a deemed marine licence for the marine aspects of that development after consultation with the MMO. Such a licence will be managed and enforced by the MMO, so that when new evidence comes to light on a particular development, the MMO will, if necessary, be able to modify any conditions of the licence, add new conditions or even revoke it. I think that that gives the MMO very important status and standing.</p>

If we are talking about the bigger ports and the major infrastructure developments offshore for energy generation, once planning consent has been granted and construction work has started, the likelihood that the MMO is going to leap to its feet and ask for things to be demolished and taken away is nil. We must take a realistic view about what the power of variation of conditions will mean in reality.</p>

<a name="90505-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09050530000071"></a>Turning to the detail of the amendments, the way the Planning Act works is to place a duty on applicants to consult the MMO at the pre-application stage, and once an application has been accepted by the IPC, to notify the MMO and invite it to make representations. Amendment 49 would, in effect, duplicate what the Planning Act regime will already require, in that the applicant will have already notified the MMO and invited it to make representations regarding the application. It is our clear intention that the national policy statement and the marine policy statement will be consistent. Of course, there may be many cases where the MMO will have nothing to add to an individual application over and above the opinions of the IPC and we would be concerned about imposing an absolute obligation, as proposed in Amendment 51, on the MMO to give advice in such circumstances. At the moment, the MMO would advise only as required, which would already be the case under the system set in the Planning Act and in the secondary legislation that we intended. Moreover I believe that this intention as regards these advice-giving functions is already met through Clause 24 of the Bill, which states that the MMO may provide whatever advice it feels appropriate to other public bodies, on its own initiative or upon request.</p>

<a name="90505-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09050530000072"></a>As for the intention in the amendments to require the IPC to include specific reference to MMO advice and recommendations that were adopted when refusing or granting a licence, and to give justification for not adopting any of this advice or recommendations, the MMO will be a statutory party as part of the IPC&#146;s examination of marine projects. Like advice from any body with statutory duties, any advice from the MMO provided to the IPC will be an important part of the IPC&#146;s consideration. Section 116 of the Planning Act already imposes a duty on the IPC to give reasons for the decisions it makes. In practice, the IPC would need  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_499"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 499</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to justify itself when not following the MMO&#146;s advice. The IPC has to justify its decision and would clearly be at risk of having that decision overturned in the courts.</p>

<a name="90505-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09050530000073"></a>I have some reservations about the exact details of the amendments, but I understand the importance of the substance of what is contained in the argument in support of those amendments. I understand the need to give as much certainty as possible about the relationship between the MMO and the IPC. I understand that noble Lords want to ensure that the expertise and experience that the MMO will gain is utilised. It is worth making the point that, if we take account of offshore developments, the MMO will be building up experience, because it will be the statutory body asked to give consents for projects up to 100 megawatts, so it will have a lot of expertise to give.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09050530000075"></a>I hope that, on that basis, noble Lords will accept that the Government are prepared to engage in these important matters and that we can come back to this at Third Reading with an amendment that meets the substance of the arguments that noble Lords have put.</p>

The MMO, rightly, must be consulted first, as the Minister has reinforced again today. It is a statutory party regarding decisions that are taken. At the end of the day, though, the organisation is consulted only as it stands in the Bill. I seek clarification on this point. If the IPC decides that it does not agree with the MMO&#146;s findings, the IPC overrules it. The Minister is nodding.</p>

We have heard today that, although a number of noble Lords do not agree with the relationship between the IPC and the MMO, that relationship is central to offshore marine developments of above 100 megawatts. There are safeguards, however. It was intended that we use secondary legislation to make the issue of consultation clear, but I have agreed to see what government amendment or amendments we could bring forward to enshrine those safeguards in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09050546000003"></a>I say to the noble Baroness that the work of the IPC will take place in the context of the national policy statements, while that of the MMO will take place in the context of the marine policy statements. Given that it is the Government&#146;s responsibility to bring forward those statements, we are under an obligation to ensure that there is consistency between the two, and we will seek to do that.</p>

The intention behind these subsections was to allow staff who were not legally qualified to conduct litigation in the magistrates&#146; courts and to exercise certain rights of audience in those courts. For more straightforward cases we believe that it should be possible for certain employees authorised by the MMO to be involved in some trials and to recover civil penalties. That will allow cases to come before the courts more speedily, especially in the case of guilty pleas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09050546000012"></a>The amendment simply clarifies the intent of that policy. Clause 28(4) gives the MMO the power to designate any person to conduct proceedings in the magistrates&#146; court, whereas we need to provide that power only in relation to those who are not legally qualified. Amendment 53 therefore rewords the clause so that the MMO can authorise specifically those people who are not legally qualified.</p>

<a name="90505-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09050546000013"></a>The amendment also clarifies the existing provisions as well as our policy on cases that staff who are not legally qualified can carry out. Clause 28(5) sets out the type of rights of audience that the MMO may designate staff who are not legally qualified to carry out, while subsection (7) provides detail about when a trial is taken to begin and end for the purposes of a right of audience in trials of summary offences. Clause 28(8) includes a definition of what we mean by &#147;bail proceedings&#148; through reference to other relevant enactments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09050546000019"></a>I find it of some interest that the mechanism used in subsection (4) in designating the different devolved areas is an Order in Council. Some kind advice that the Minister offered me is that Section 14 of the Interpretation Act 1978, if applied, would imply a power for amending or modifying an Order in Council.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09050546000020"></a>What strikes me is that what we are looking at here predates the coming of devolution while not predating our acceptance of some European legislation. The issue might not be as clear as it once was. Let us suppose it became necessary to move the boundary between the English and Scottish offshore areas, or, heaven forbid, a new Administration in Scotland decided that they were not going to participate in the marine policy statement, but would insist that an Order in Council was not just any order and could not be overturned. Perhaps they would be able to argue that under some abstruse European statute, Orders in Council came under the aegis of their Administration. A clause such as the one I have proposed might serve to clarify any doubt there would be on the point. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09050546000022"></a>Undoubtedly, the designation of boundaries has a capacity for controversy. When the Scottish Parliament was established just 10 years ago, I well recall that one of the first orders we had to pass, which had previously been passed in this Parliament, was to determine the boundary between Scotland and England for devolution of fisheries matters. They took a line, which went at an angle from where the Scotland/England boundary hits the coast just north of Berwick-upon-Tweed. That was contested by many Members of the Scottish Parliament, including those of my own party. Indeed, the first rebellion of my Back-Benchers was on that occasion, and we narrowly won the vote. Therefore, the issue is not without controversy.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09050546000023"></a>However, there are certain advantages and certainty with a boundary that is set rather than one that continually flows back and forth; although I noted in an edition of the <I>Economist</I> last month that because of melting glaciers in the Alps the boundary between Italy and Switzerland is on the move. I do not think that anyone is suggesting that there is a similar sort of geological change here, but I cannot honestly be persuaded by the case made by the noble Duke, although undoubtedly these are sensitive issues.</p>

Therefore, I appreciate the interest in this clause and the amendment moved by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose. The Government consider that the time has come for the United Kingdom to declare an exclusive economic zone. This is an internationally recognised concept that is characteristically set out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Up to now we have declared different zones for different purposes&#151;fisheries, marine pollution, renewable energy and carbon storage. We recognise that the accumulation of these different zones produces the potential for confusion domestically, and is somewhat contrary to best international practice. Therefore, we believe that declaring an exclusive economic zone is the right course.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09050546000025"></a>We do not think that the issue with regard to the amendment arises. The noble Duke referred to the Interpretation Act 1978, which applies to these orders made under Clause 39(4). I am sorry if it causes some difficulty, but the Interpretation Act is there to facilitate all concerned with these issues, to make it easier for the law to be understood and therefore enacted. Implied in the power in Clause 39(4) is a power to revoke, amend or re-enact any order made under that clause. Therefore, we already have, under the Interpretation Act, the very power that the noble Duke identified.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09050546000026"></a>I have no way of allaying the broad anxiety, which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, indicated, that there can be differences of interpretation about the contestability of boundaries. I am all too well aware that that is a sensitive issue with implications as regards aspects of the relationship between England and Scotland, to say nothing of other devolved practice. I cannot answer that within the framework of this very limited amendment to the clause. What I am obliged to answer is why this amendment is not necessary and I have sought to make that case. I hope the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, is satisfied on that point.</p>

It is of course very useful that, even if the amendment is any good, he has at least stated the issue from the Dispatch Box for anybody who wishes to look at it again. We hope that if alterations to boundaries do become necessary&#151;and I still think that they might&#151;they will be achieved amicably and that there will not be any need to worry about rescinding legislation.

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09050548000004"></a>In Committee I tabled amendments on the relationship between the marine policy statement and the national policy statements under the Planning Act. It was explained to me that the subsection that I had attempted to amend had the purpose of promoting internal consistency within the marine policy statement. I did understand that. I am sorry that I did not make it clear that I understood not only that but that my own amendments would have taken the matter of consistency into a different area. So I say at the start that I am concerned not about internal consistency within the marine policy statement&#151;I am concerned about it, but not for the purposes of this amendment&#151;but about how we can be assured that the marine policy statement and the potentially large number of national policy statements are consistent, not as a matter of intention or aspiration but through the process provided by the legislation.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09050548000005"></a>That is not quite as easy or obvious as it might appear, because more than one Administration are involved in the marine policy statement. At the last stage, the Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_141"></a><a name="09050548000092"></a>&#147;If, as we intend, all four Administrations agree&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/01/2009; col. 331.]</p>

<p><a name="09050548000086"></a>I read that phrase to my noble friend Lord Alderdice, who, with his background in one of the Administrations, laughed for quite a long time.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09050548000006"></a>These amendments seek a greater understanding of the process provided for by the legislation. Amendments 60 and 61 would deal with the marine policy statement covered in Clause 42. Grouped with them, as they are on similar points, are Amendments 76 and 77 to Clause 49, which is about marine plans, and Amendments 89 and 90 to Clause 56, which is about authorisation and the enforcement of decisions.

She also mentioned the relationship between this Administration and the devolved Administrations. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, might be in the Chamber for the order that is about to be debated as it covers matters in which he has a great interest. I am not quite sure what lay behind his laughter, which the noble Baroness described. Our discussions with the devolved Administrations over the past few months about the Bill and the areas where we need absolute clarity and consistency between the Administrations have gone very well indeed.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09050548000008"></a>These are interesting amendments. One of their themes is the extent of the influence of the plans and the marine policy statement on the IPC&#146;s decisions; hence the amendment which would require the IPC to take its decisions in accordance with marine policy documents. Another thread in the amendments is that which relates to which documents and policies should take precedence in the event of a conflict between them.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09050548000009"></a>We are always in danger of reopening the regime established by the Planning Act 2008, which the Government are reluctant to do. We believe that it has established a new regime for allowing us to address the national need for infrastructure that is vital to the future of this country. The new regime has been put in place precisely because of the recognition of the particular and special importance of nationally significant infrastructure projects and the considerable challenges that are related to them. In particular, I believe that there is a lot of support for the notion that there should be a special planning and consenting regime to consider them. Nationally significant infrastructure projects which are in the marine area, whether they are related to ports or energy generation, are a vital part of this new process. The Government have consistently argued that those projects should not be removed from the new planning regime simply because they are in the marine area.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09050548000010"></a>We think that it is entirely appropriate that the IPC will make its decisions in accordance with the national policy statements but also have regard to the marine policy statement and relevant plans, because we think that that gets the relationship right. Clearly, as far as the IPC is concerned, the relevant national policy statement will be the prime statement. However, we are also clear that the IPC must have regard to the marine policy statement. I do not want to take us back to the debate on group 10, but we also expect the MMO to have a strong role by having to be consulted on pre-applications and then to have an involvement in the IPC&#146;s examination process itself.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09050548000011"></a>I also want to reiterate a point which I have made consistently. The national policy statements and the marine policy statement plans will be entirely consistent&#151;they have to be. The same departments will collectively be involved in establishing both the NPS and the marine policy statement. It would be intolerable if there were inconsistency and conflicts between the two statements. It would not give the kind of clarity that all noble Lords, including me and the Government, wish to see.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09050548000012"></a>I know that the noble Baroness&#146;s Amendments 89 and 90 seek to ensure that policies in the marine policy statement or plans will always take precedence over those in the national policy statements. Of course, Clause 56 imposes a clear duty on public authorities, with the single exception of the IPC, to take any authorisation or enforcement decision relating to the marine area in accordance with the marine policy statement and plans. In contrast, the only public authority under a direct duty to take its decisions in accordance with the national policy statements is the IPC, in view of the national significance of projects on which it will take decisions. So those duties and the relative precedence of the marine policy statement and national policy statements in relation to authorisation and enforcement decisions seem to be entirely appropriate.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09050548000013"></a>The question of precedence is less acute in relation to the secondary duty on public authorities to have regard to the marine policy statement and plans when taking their other marine decisions. Even so, that duty to have regard to the marine policy documents is clear and applies to any decision which is capable of affecting the UK marine area.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09050548000014"></a>I am not unrealistic. I recognise that there will sometimes be circumstances in which a planning authority is to have regard to both a national policy statement and the marine policy statement. Despite the best endeavours of government, there could be a conflict between the two which had not previously been foreseen, and I do not think that as a matter of principle one could provide that the marine documents should in all cases outweigh the national policy statements. Policies on matters of national significance will by their very nature often be different from those relating to local matters. Sometimes a decision-maker, such as a coastal local planning authority in the present context, may need to consider both when deciding what weight as a material or relevant consideration should be given to each. We have therefore not imposed duties to take these decisions in accordance with either the marine policy statement or the national policy statements, precisely because in such circumstances we believe that public authorities should use their discretion and judgment, looking at the context and the likely impacts of possible decisions.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09050548000015"></a>That is not an unusual approach and, after many years&#146; experience, planning authorities are experts in weighing up and integrating government policy. We would also expect them to seek advice from the relevant department on how to resolve any conflict, which will help us to identify any potential need for clarification or amendment of our policies. It should not be a question of technical precedence but of taking the best decision for the marine area and the national interest in all the circumstances.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09050548000016"></a>If the noble Baroness were to press her amendments and they were accepted by your Lordships they might reduce the clarity in the Bill about how any conflicts within the MPS or plan should be resolved. Clauses 42(3) and 49(9) presently provide that in the event of a conflict between the policy and any other information included in an MPS or plan, the conflict is to be resolved in favour of the policy. This provision is

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09050548000017"></a>I apologise for speaking at such length. It is so good to see the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, now in his place. It is not too late for him to intervene and explain why he thinks that collaboration between the UK Government and the devolved Administrations will not work on the marine Bill. His timing is impeccable.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09050548000018"></a>I fully understand why the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has moved these amendments&#151;she seeks clarity. I want to reassure her that we thought a lot about this. We do not want the circumstance that she fears to arise whereby there is a lack of clarity and a conflict and the relevant public bodies do not know what to do. It is clear, as it has to be, that the IPC must turn first to the national policy statements.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09050548000019"></a>I turn to my own amendment in this group. It is a minor and technical amendment to correct a typographical error in Clause 56(4). As noble Lords will have noted, the closing words should read &#147;in relation to which&#148; rather than &#147;relating to which&#148;, as currently in the Bill. I hope that noble Lords will support the Government on that amendment.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09050548000021"></a>We on these Benches often see our role as one of asking the &#147;what ifs&#148;. I found what the Minister said very helpful. It certainly deserves to be read properly. It went a great deal further than the response that I had on similar amendments in Committee. He accepts the possibility of conflict, as do we, not least because the two sets of statements may have been developed at different times, with slightly different considerations. I need to think about his comment on not allowing a technical response and the Government being unable to tweak policy. I think that that was more or less what he said.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09050548000022"></a>I am left with one query. In saying that the MPS and the NPSs must be consistent, is the Minister saying that the Secretary of State would not agree something that was inconsistent if there were a conflict between the Secretary of State and one or more of the devolved Administrations? That seems to be what he is saying or the natural conclusion to his comments. His comments were helpful. I certainly do not intend to press the matter tonight. My objective is to understand the Government&#146;s thinking and how it would all work rather better than was set out at the previous stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09050548000024"></a>I am aware that there has been a lot of interest in the build-up to this debate both in support of and against the provisions. There appears to be a good deal of confusion about the content of the order, what it provides for and what it does not. I should therefore like to spend a little time going through the provisions of the order and dealing with some of the issues that have been raised.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09050548000025"></a>This order introduces statutory regulation of practitioner psychologists across the UK. It is in this area that I think most of the confusion has arisen, so let me make clear now that the order makes no provision at all for the regulation of psychotherapists or counsellors. Psychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors are part of a number of professional groups offering talking therapies. At the moment, the only regulated group is psychiatrists, who are regulated as doctors by the GMC. As doctors they can also prescribe drugs to patients. The next highest qualified providers of talking therapies are practitioner psychologists, who are now being regulated for the first time. They must all have postgraduate qualifications.</p>

<a name="90505-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09050548000026"></a>Consideration is also being given to the regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors who have descending levels of professional qualification. The Health Professions Council has been working with bodies representing these groups to develop proposals but we are not there yet. Those discussions are continuing but no formal decisions have been made although we understand that the working group is hoping to report to the council of the HPC later this year. Any proposals to regulate psychotherapists and counsellors will be subject to further consultation before legislation is brought before the House. Given the weight of interventions on this matter by psychotherapists, we anticipate robust discussion and consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09050548000027"></a>Statutory regulation exists to protect the public from poorly performing practitioners. It does this essentially in three ways: first, by setting standards of practice, training and conduct; secondly, by registering  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_511"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 511</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those who have trained as competent and fit to practise; and thirdly, by operating a system to investigate and impose sanctions on registrants who are found unfit to practise. However, we do not wish to regulate for the sake of regulation.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09050548000028"></a>As regards practitioner psychologists, after much discussion and consultation we have identified seven areas of practice within the overarching discipline of psychology where the majority of those practising work with individuals or groups on interventions to improve their health or well-being, and as such carry the greatest potential for causing harm to their patients. These groups are clinical psychologists, health psychologists, counselling psychologists, forensic psychologists, educational psychologists, occupational psychologists and sport and exercise psychologists. We do not want to regulate all psychologists as this would capture significant numbers of psychologists who do not work with clients or patients and who form no risk to the health and well-being of individuals; for example, those psychologists working in the area of pure academic research, teachers and other psychology graduates who we do not wish statutorily to regulate. Nor do we want to protect the title &#147;psychologist&#148; for the exclusive use of those we are regulating as that would prevent these other groups who we do not wish to regulate but who have a legitimate claim to that title, from using it.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09050548000029"></a>I am aware that there are a number of chartered psychologists with practising certificates who the British Psychological Society consider should have their names automatically transferred to the new HPC register, along with those who are members of the seven divisions of the BPC, whose members will transfer automatically. However, it is not clear whether these chartered psychologists are entitled to membership of those seven divisions. If they are not, they are not at present allowed by the BPS to use the titles associated with membership of those divisions&#151;for example, clinical psychologist&#151;and as the BPS has not granted them the right to use those titles we are not prepared to provide for their automatic transfer to the new register, which would give them that right. However, we are asking the BPS to work with us to resolve these situations. I should emphasise that a cornerstone of statutory regulation is restricting the use of titles associated with a profession to those who should properly be entitled to use them. This means that the public can be reassured that a person who calls himself, for example, a clinical psychologist, is fully qualified and able to treat them as such.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09050548000030"></a>As a consequence of all this those BPS members with practising certificates who are not allowed by the BPS to use the basic protected titles will need, if they wish to use any of those protected titles, to apply to the HPC for registration once the statutory register opens. The HPC has indicated that it will recognise all existing qualifications that would have led to chartered psychologist status. If a BPS member holds one of these qualifications, they will be able to apply for registration in the same way as newly qualified psychologists. Any current practitioners who do not have recognised qualifications will be able to go through a process known as &#147;grandparenting&#148;&#151;an assessment process under which each application is assessed

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09050548000031"></a>The remainder of the order makes various amendments to the framework legislation for the regulation of dentists, dental care professionals, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and those professions regulated by the Health Professions Council. It also extends the statutory regulation of pharmacy technicians to Scotland. Some Members present may recall the interesting debates last year on similar orders and the Health and Social Care Act.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09050548000032"></a>Changes to the governance arrangements of the General Dental Council and the Health Professions Council include moving each of these bodies from a partially elected to a fully and independently appointed council to ensure that professional interests should not unduly influence council deliberations. In the past year five other health professions regulators have already made this move: the General Medical Council; the General Chiropractic Council; the General Osteopathic Council; the General Optical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09050548000033"></a>Other miscellaneous amendments include: the standardisation of the statutory duties to ensure that regulators consider the interests of stakeholders in their deliberations; new arrangements for accountability to Parliament, including a new requirement for each regulator to report on its arrangements for ensuring that it adheres to good practice in relation to equality and diversity; a new requirement for the GDC and HPC to publish a strategic plan; and new arrangements for the constitutions of statutory committees of the GDC and HPC.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09050548000034"></a>Amendments are made to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 and to a range of fitness to practise rules for each of the regulatory bodies. These amendments will make it easier for regulators to strike off registrants who are barred from working with children or vulnerable adults when the new Independent Safeguarding Authority is established.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09050548000035"></a>Provisions in relation to emergencies such as pandemic flu will allow the registrar of the RPSGB to register anyone he considers suitably experienced as a pharmacist, such as recently retired pharmacists, during a public health emergency and to give enhanced prescribing rights to more of its registrants.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09050548000036"></a>I should perhaps also point out that in the debates elsewhere on this order, in both the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament, the regulation of clinical physiologists and other scientist groups has been raised. Noble Lords may be aware that the role of clinical physiologists is being considered as part of the modernising scientific careers programme, about which the Department of Health recently consulted. Officials are considering the responses to that consultation before developing proposals for regulation. All the measures are supported by each of the regulatory bodies covered by this order. I commend it to the House.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_513"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 513</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between the psychology profession and the Department of Health, as well as extensive discussion within the profession itself. I should like to be able to welcome it wholeheartedly on that account as being the settled view of all the parties involved, but, unfortunately, I cannot quite bring myself to do that because I am aware, as, I am sure, is the Minister, that there is great disquiet among members of the profession about what this order will mean for them and their patients and clients, and the precedent that it is likely to set as regards the related disciplines of psychotherapy and counselling in particular. My mailbag has been full to bursting with letters from psychologists and psychotherapists expressing total anguish about what the order contains and about the consultation that preceded it, which they see as having been stage managed. It has not been particularly easy to tell those correspondents that by longstanding convention this House does not vote down secondary legislation. What we have in front of us, at least the part of it that relates to the regulation of psychologists, cannot, unfortunately, be described as a settled view or one that is universally welcomed.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09050548000038"></a>Before tackling the detail, perhaps I may briefly comment on the part of the order that gives rise to little or no controversy. I can certainly give a welcome to the section dealing with the General Dental Council. The arrangements will bring the GDC into line with the GMC and other regulators, as the Minister said, regarding the composition of their council, and puts other aspects of its governance arrangements on to a more up-to-date footing. I can also express my support of the provisions that cover the pharmacy profession. The legislation relating to the statutory regulation of pharmacy technicians in England and Wales has not yet been brought into force, so it is welcome that with the order we are considering, there is the immediate prospect of having regulation of pharmacy technicians across Great Britain as a whole. I am also glad that in line with the nursing and medical professions, provisions have been included that will enable the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain to register individuals as practising pharmacists on an emergency basis for a temporary period.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09050548000039"></a>Those are the uncontroversial elements of the order: I return to the more difficult ones. One of the points that people have made when writing to me&#151;I am talking about practising psychologists&#151;is that they see no practical need for statutory regulation of the profession and maintain that the case for it has not been made. With no disrespect to the individuals involved, I have been looking too long at these issues to be able to endorse that point of view. In the 21st century, with a need for full professional accountability, professional standards of practice, transparency and protection of the public, it is difficult to argue that statutory regulation in any form whatever is unnecessary. Some have argued that there is already voluntary regulation through the British Psychological Society and other professional bodies, so why do we need to make it statutory?</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09050548000040"></a>There are several answers. One is that the present system does not protect the key professional titles. Anyone can call himself a clinical or health psychologist without any recognised professional basis for doing so. That cannot be right from the point of view of  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public protection. Another reason is that although the professional bodies are made up of fair minded and conscientious individuals, they are accountable in the end to no one but themselves. Through the order comes the link to Parliament and the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. I believe that to be a positive, not a negative, step.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09050548000041"></a>Many of the fears expressed to me have related more to psychotherapists and counsellors than practitioner psychologists. The reason why those fears have been voiced so loudly is that the order is viewed as the forerunner to an inevitable sequel that will impose statutory regulation on those other disciplines. That is what people are fearful of. I will quote from one letter that I have received, which is representative of many:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_142"></a><a name="09050548000093"></a>&#147;If registration of psychologists, counsellors and psychotherapists goes ahead, it will lead to the standardisation of knowledge and training and stifle the diversity of thought and practice among the talking therapies. This diversity is a source of strength and creativity, reflecting the diversity of human experience ... Standardisation is also potentially discriminatory, as it would be based on the dominant forms of subjectivity, which marginalise many [minority groups] ... In the long run it would reduce the choice of therapies available in the independent sector, as training courses not approved by the state would find it difficult to fill places&#148;.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09050548000042"></a>I am troubled by those criticisms, because while one would not want to encourage wild and dangerous experimental practice, I can see that being able to branch out into new territory and not having a totally homogenised and inflexible set of standards is highly desirable. No professional discipline can be set in aspic. The basic charge is that regulation under the HPC will create a narrow and restrictive definition of the field within which psychologists operate and thereby deprive the public of a wide range of therapies; in other words, state-sponsored rigidity. What does the Minister have to say?</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09050548000043"></a>An equally difficult issue that some have raised with me is that practitioner psychologists see their work as more of an art than a science. What that means is that effective outcomes rest largely on the personal qualities of the practitioner, such as empathy and intuition, qualities that are not quantifiable and thus not amenable to regulation. Equally, because each client is unique, what counts as successful professional activity cannot be captured by a set of defined competencies. Individual well-being cannot be captured as a standard because each individual is different, with a different view of what well-being means for him or her.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09050548000044"></a>I wonder whether the Minister can give me her reaction to this point. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, I am not able to form a professional view of it, but one problem is that if good professional practice is wholly incapable of being defined, as is suggested, the same has to be true of poor professional practice and there would be no need to train anyone. That cannot possibly be correct. If it were, it seems that we would not be able to call psychology a profession at all. Nevertheless, there is a kernel of genuine concern about the nature of outcomes in psychology, which are seen as being different in kind and substance from outcomes in, say, medicine, which can be measured and objectively defined.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90505-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09050548000045"></a>Two main concerns have been raised with me by the British Psychological Society and I ask the Minister to comment on them. The first is about the threshold entry level for safe and effective practice. The Minister of State in another place took issue with the BPS&#146;s long-standing position on this, which is that the threshold entry is at doctorate level or level 12. That is the level at which all existing qualifications and training are set for all existing chartered psychologists. Therefore, what the Minister said flatly contradicts the assurance which the BPS received, which was that quality standards would not be lowered by the transition from the voluntary to the statutory register. It is also, incidentally, somewhat presumptuous. How can any Minister pre-empt a decision about professional standards that the HPC itself will need to make?</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09050548000046"></a>The second issue raised by the society was helpfully covered in the Minister&#146;s remarks; it relates to the chartered psychologists whom this order will exclude from registration. According to the BPS there are about 2,000 of them. I was grateful for the Minister&#146;s remarks, but the BPS has pointed out to me that all those people are considered by the society to be suitably qualified and fit to practise and some of them have been on the register for many years. The charge against the Department of Health is that Ministers have taken a decision on an unjustifiably narrow basis to recognise only those chartered psychologists who happen to be members of one of seven professional divisions. Not only will this order leave the public unprotected from this large number of independent practitioners; but it will also disbar those individuals from professional practice using a protected title. This amounts to a distortion of the market and a restraint of trade. That is a serious charge and I should be grateful if the Minister could respond to it.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09050548000047"></a>A number of correspondents have asked a very simple question, which is, &#147;What makes the Government think that the HPC is capable of protecting the public reliably and effectively in this particular field?&#148; That question brings us back to the debate we held in this Chamber just over two years ago when the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, and I argued strongly for the setting up of an independent statutory regulator for psychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors. The Government have instead chosen to go down the HPC route, apparently because they have set their face against creating yet another independent regulator. But the worries remain, because up to now the focus of the HPC has been very much directed towards professions related to healthcare. Psychology is seen as being quite distinct from healthcare. Large numbers of psychologists work completely outside a healthcare environment and cannot sensibly be subject to the same sorts of standards of assessment. It is the same concern as that which I mentioned earlier. People are afraid that, because the HPC does not understand psychology, it will serve only to homogenise professional regulation in ways that take no account of the individuality and diversity that creative practical psychology should encourage. In other words, it will force psychologists into a regulatory mould in which they do not fit.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09050548000048"></a>By contrast, a dedicated, professionally-led regulatory body would by definition have been able to accommodate  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_516"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such individuality and diversity. It would be helpful to hear from the Minister why, in the end, the Government rejected this option. Had they accepted it, I have little doubt that it would have commanded much wider acceptance among members of the individual professions than, sadly, this statutory instrument has been able to do.</p>

<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="09050548000049"></a><b><a name="90505-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09050548000110"></a>Lord Alderdice:</b> My Lords, I declare an interest in the parliamentary sense as a consultant psychiatrist in psychotherapy, and I run the Centre for Psychotherapy in Belfast, which is a National Health Service facility.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09050548000050"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for introducing the order. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, she helpfully outlined some of the issues that come to the fore. There are a number of elements of the order to which I wish to draw attention. Like the noble Earl, I entirely welcome the emergency provisions and the safeguarding of vulnerable groups provisions that are put in place. Like him, I find these uncontentious. I understand that, with regard to the professional bodies, no particular objections have been lodged&#151;for example, by the General Dental Council&#151;to the changes that are proposed in the order, effectively to remove the possibility of professionals electing from among their own professional colleagues a number who would exert professional oversight.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09050548000051"></a>I am less sanguine about this development than many of those involved. The appointment of all members would mean that there is no real independent professional voice, for all effectively will be government appointees. The Government are an interested party in this matter, since in many of these professions they are an almost monopoly employer through the NHS. In the case of dentists, one of the problems is that a degree of disenchantment has meant that a very large number have left the NHS. I would have thought that that in itself was an interesting marker to which the Government and the General Dental Council might have paid attention. However, I do not wish to major on this, because it seems that the professionals in those areas are content to go with it.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09050548000052"></a>On the subject of regulatory peculiarities, I am used to inconsistencies between different orders. For example, as the noble Earl pointed out, I proposed about 10 years ago the establishment of a council for psychotherapy, and I shall return to that later. The Government insisted that they would not support such a proposal, because they were absolutely not going to have any further separate professional bodies; everything would be subsumed within the Health Professions Council. Then they promptly decided to create the General Pharmaceutical Council, referring to a much smaller number of professionals than would have been the case in psychotherapy, never mind within psychological therapies as a whole. So I am familiar with this kind of inconsistency between orders.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09050548000053"></a>However, here we have inconsistency within the order. There is now going to be a UK-wide application of a psychologist&#146;s registration to all four parts of the United Kingdom, but Northern Ireland will be specifically excluded from statutory registration of pharmacy technicians. The order brings Scotland into line, but not Northern Ireland. I know that Northern Ireland is  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_517"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 517</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not easy to bring into line on a number of issues, but it seems to me particularly strange in this regard, for while there will be relatively few pharmacy technicians in Northern Ireland in numerical terms, and almost all of them will simply work within Northern Ireland, there are already a number of psychologists who operate across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It seems to me that there is something particularly strange here. I rather suspect&#151;in fact, I am rather sure&#151;that the Minister and her colleagues have been in consultation with the Northern Ireland Executive. I do not for a minute wish to hold her accountable for the decisions of the Northern Ireland Executive, if that were even possible. However, I would be interested to know whether any justification was requested on the differing decisions to have psychology as a UK-wide registration but to have Northern Ireland specifically excluded in respect of pharmacy technicians.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09050548000054"></a>The main issue is the new statutory registration of practitioner psychologists and the potential implications for psychotherapists and counsellors. The House will be aware that the subject of statutory registration for psychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors is one that I have pursued through two Private Members&#146; Bills, a number of Parliamentary Questions, debates and other modalities. I make it very clear that I am supportive of statutory regulation and registration. Indeed, if Her Majesty&#146;s Government had accepted some of my proposals in this place 10 years ago, they would have been operative for some time.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09050548000055"></a>One argument at the time against my Bill was that it would take too long and that to pursue things through Section 60 of the then Health Bill would be much quicker and easier. At that time, I was conducting a number of discussions, which involved the BPS, UKCP, BCP, BACP, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Association of Child Psychotherapists and a number of other bodies. The department successfully wooed away the British Psychological Society with the promise that things would move much more quickly. The BPS had been pursuing the possibility of a Private Member&#146;s Bill in another place bringing in registration. The department promised that things could move much more quickly if only the BPS would separate itself off from these difficult and contentious people in psychotherapy and counselling. Almost 10 years later, we find ourselves with an order for psychologists and with still nothing really in sight for psychotherapists and counsellors. I think that the concerns of the noble Baroness about the difficulties that there might be ahead are well informed.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09050548000056"></a>The HPC is being used but, in a letter dated 26 September 2006, the president of the BPS said that the BPS opposed having the HPC as a regulator because it was,</p>
<ul><a name="09050548000094"></a>&#147;not fit for that purpose&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050548000087"></a>That is why the BPS had engaged with other professional bodies and brought forward the proposal of a psychological professions council, which would, among other things, have brought all psychological therapies and professionals together. The Minister said that psychiatrists were the only ones that were currently regulated. This is almost the case, because it is also the case that arts psychotherapists are regulated through  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_518"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Health Professions Council, so there is a little bit of experience there. A psychological professions council would bring all of them together, with a different understanding of things from that belonging to those working in the physical therapies and physical scientific approaches that are largely the base for the Health Professions Council.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09050548000057"></a>It is also the case, as has been mentioned, that the order has effectively split the profession of psychology. Those psychologists who are working specifically in healthcare and in a number of other areas will be separated off from those who are&#151;if one might say so&#151;the pure science, research academic psychologists, who will not be required to register; in some ways, it would not be appropriate for them to do so, because they are not health professionals. Effectively, this divorces them, which is a problem that would not have arisen if a psychological professions council had been the modality that was taken forward.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09050548000058"></a>I am puzzled as to why the Government have not proceeded with the psychological professions council. It is only a few minutes since the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, was on the Front Bench making kind remarks about me. He was the Minister responsible in 2000 and 2001, when he indicated that there was a case for a separate council. In private, he endearingly called it a &#147;talking heads council&#148;, but perhaps the term &#147;psychological professions council&#148; would be more congenial. I think that he did not entirely let go of his belief, even some time later.</p>

<a name="90505-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09050548000059"></a>I would like the Minister to put on record why it has not been possible to create the new council. It cannot be a financial or an organisational question, because a much smaller number of practitioners is involved than with the General Pharmaceutical Council, yet it has been possible to establish that. Indeed&#151;here I cast a sidelong glance at the noble Earl&#151;it may not be long before a new Government are in place; they certainly will be before there are proposals for the regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors. I wonder whether that might be the time&#151;for tonight does not appear to be the time&#151;when we might rectify this misguided approach and establish a psychological professions council that would be the suitable home for psychologists, psychotherapists, counsellors, arts therapists and others, as such a council would understand more fully the complexities of the work and the difference between that work and what is appropriate for the Health Professions Council to regulate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09050548000061"></a>Independent statutory regulation of practitioners, including psychologists, is very important to protect members of the public. Regulators should be independent of the Government and the professions that they   


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_519"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulate, so that they can make and be seen to make&#151;that is very important&#151;appropriate decisions in the public interest. For these reasons, regulators have been going through extensive processes to make their structures and governance more responsive to patients and the public. The HPC itself has been going through such processes. Subject to the order being confirmed tonight, I understand that the HPC intends to open registration on 1 July. CHRE welcomes this and believes that it will be welcomed also by patients and the public.</p>

<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="09050548000062"></a><b><a name="90505-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09050548000112"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> My Lords, as a member of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, let me say that there are some technical deficiencies in the order. I will not concentrate on those tonight, although I will refer to one or two.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09050548000063"></a>I am not as sanguine as my noble friend Lord Howe is about the benefits of statutory regulation and would like to emphasise what the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, said about independence. The great problem with all systems of statutory regulation that I have been involved with is that it is very difficult to believe that you have the independence that you were promised. I have debated the independence of public bodies a number of times in this House and usually I have been disappointed.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09050548000064"></a>On this occasion, deep within the 51 pages of the order, we come upon Schedule 4, which consists of three and a half pages of amendments to legislation to bring seven categories of &#147;protected title&#148; psychologists under statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council, thus splitting the British Psychological Society down the middle, as its members have testified and as we have been told tonight.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09050548000065"></a>The statutory regulation of psychologists takes us on to new ground. It is a most significant proposal. Why is it before us? Relying on material put before the Merits Committee, and I hope not being too unkind, I think that the purpose is allegedly to modernise. This is the first new Labour mantra prayed in aid. There are two more: patient safety and public confidence. The problem is that no evidence is produced and no argument made, in the explanation of this order, that the modernisation will improve patient safety or public confidence. It is taken as a given. Nor is any argument made that either patient safety or public confidence is a problem when it comes to psychological practice. The regulatory impact assessment simply states that government intervention is necessary. &#147;Necessary&#148; is a strong word. We are not told why, but I think that we know why: it is an a priori judgment by the Government. As we know, new Labour has a strong preference for Secretary of State-controlled statutory regulation.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09050548000066"></a>What results from this state-controlled mechanical agenda is an increase from 134 HPC malpractice allegations in 2003-04 to three times that number in 2007-08, against a 30 per cent&#151;less than one-third&#151;increase in practitioners regulated under the 13 present headings. Psychologists will take the HPC on to new ground: matters of the mind. The attempt to codify and define will open the door to a rapid rise in imaginative allegations. One needs only to look at the prescriptive detail that the HPC thinks is appropriate for psychological qualification. Does the Minister really  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_520"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>believe that a rising tide of allegations is, or ever will be, a good indicator of patient safety or public confidence?</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09050548000067"></a>There is also the dilemma of the consultation already referred to by my noble friend on the Front Bench. Why is it that many deeply held convictions of professionals were not expressed in the Government&#146;s record of the consultation, when the Merits Committee, unusually, received many well argued representations that statutory regulation will not benefit the public? Nothing in the Explanatory Memorandum or the regulatory impact assessment implies any controversy, yet there is plenty about.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09050548000068"></a>Why the gap in perception? First, it is the centralised, all-powerful NHS effect&#151;the fear of being on the wrong side of a controlling Government who hold many of the purse strings. The loss of employment can turn people into collaborators. Secondly, the consultation questions make it clear that statutory regulation will happen. They ask nothing about patient safety or about public confidence, present or prospective. The heart of the matter is left as an unarguable tautology: modernisation is by its very nature good.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09050548000069"></a>Finally, there will be additional costs, recoverable, no doubt, through fees. The HPC&#146;s costs have been rising sharply and it has had to take a significant property impairment charge. This all looks pretty amateur to this old servant of the public. Any rise in costs is to be doubly deprecated in today&#146;s circumstances. We are probably stuck with the order, or at least the psychological part of it, but it should be the last with &#147;psy&#148; in the title.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09050548000071"></a>Perhaps I should start with the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. At no point have I used the word &#147;modernise&#148;; at no point have I used the word &#147;codifying&#148;. The Government are not intervening for the sake of it, but to ensure patient safety and higher standards. The figures that I shall cite later show that the vast majority of psychologists support this move. The figures speak for themselves. The noble Viscount would have patients take their chances with anyone who cared to call himself a psychologist, dentist, chiropodist or whatever, but his party would be the first to scream when anyone came to harm.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09050548000072"></a>The noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, are much more experienced than I in dealing with this issue, as both of them observed. In the noble Lord&#146;s Private Member&#146;s Bill of 2001, his views were supported by the noble Earl. The work that has been done has no doubt proved helpful in clarifying thinking about how psychologists should be regulated, what standards should be used and the role of professional bodies in that regulation. I take on board the point that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, made about the time that this has taken. I agree with him; he has a very good point there; there is no doubt about that.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09050548000073"></a>The noble Earl said that the road down which we are now starting with the regulation of psychologists may lead to the standardisation of talking therapies. That is a legitimate question, but there is no evidence that regulation in other areas has stultified the work of those professions. In this profession, which is based on  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_521"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>talking, it is even less likely that that will be the case. To deal with the specific question raised by the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice&#151;why did we in the end reject the idea of a psychological therapists council?&#151;both noble Lords gave the answer themselves. In the 2007 White Paper we set out a policy of no new regulators. No one to date has persuaded us to the contrary. The HPC has a very good record as a professional regulator.</p>

<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="09050548000074"></a><b><a name="90505-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09050548000114"></a>Lord Alderdice:</b> My Lords, with the exception, apparently, of the pharmacists.</p>

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="09050548000075"></a><b><a name="90505-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09050548000115"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, I am coming to them. As my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley pointed out, a recent report on the HPC pointed that out.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09050548000076"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of state rigidity in regulation. Psychologists and psychotherapists indeed work with vulnerable people, both adults and children, often in one-to-one situations. What they do carries significant risk to patients and to the public if it is poorly done. Although we do not want to set and impose rigid demands on the professions, it is important that standards are set that protect the public.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09050548000077"></a>Is this a forerunner to an inevitable sequel for psychotherapists and counsellors? As I said in my opening remarks, there will be a statutory period of consultation before any further orders are laid. Legislation is not inevitable&#151;although we currently agree with noble Lords that it is desirable.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09050548000078"></a>I turn to the Health Professions Council. It has a good track record in regulating a wide range of professions, many of which work in non-health settings in schools, prisons, industry and private practice. It uses the members of the professions that it regulates to provide professional expertise in regulatory functions such as the setting and approval of education and training. It makes every sense that it does that. Why would it not? It uses them in setting professional practice standards and assessing practitioners&#146; fitness to practise.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09050548000079"></a>We have consulted widely on the proposal to regulate psychologists under the Health Professions Council in both the 2005 and 2007-08 consultations. There was strong support for the regulation of psychologists through the HPC. I know that people have raised questions about the consultation, but 89 per cent supported statutory regulation of practitioner psychologists; 70 per cent agreed that psychologists and teachers working exclusively in further psychological knowledge should not be regulated; 60 per cent agreed that all seven domains should be statutorily registered by the HPC; and 60 per cent agreed that holders of BPS practising certificates who do not meet the full range of competencies for the seven domains should be eligible for registration only if they demonstrate that they meet HPC standards for safe and effective practice.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09050548000080"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of threshold entry to the profession. That is a matter for the HPC to determine. It has recently publicly consulted on the threshold of entry and standards of proficiency. The outcome of the consultation will be considered at the HPC education committee meeting in May. The  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_522"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>BPS will have been invited to respond as part of a statutory duty to consult stakeholders, so it will have had the opportunity to make representations on the issue. My honourable friend in another place has answered the letter raising the issue and clarified that with the BPS.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09050548000081"></a>The noble Earl also raised the issue of whether statutory regulation would narrow treatment options for patients. A balance must be struck between protecting people from misconduct and allowing creative new approaches to treatment, and we believe that the HPC can strike that balance. We are confident that it will respond sensitively to issues of well-being and, as the noble Earl put it, the art of talking therapies as much as their profession.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09050548000082"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, asked about Northern Ireland and pharmacy technicians being regulated on a GB basis but psychologists on a UK basis. As the noble Lord said that he knew that I would say, the regulation of health professions is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland. On this issue, we have simply followed the wishes of the devolved Administration. They expressed their wish not to regulate pharmacy technicians in the legislation. The General Pharmaceutical Council is taking over existing arrangements of statutory regulation by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. We do not believe that there needs to be a new body for newly regulated professions; the new regulation should be taken on by existing bodies&#151;generally, the HPC.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09050548000083"></a>The noble Lord and the noble Earl raised the issue of splitting professionals and asked why we were not regulating the academics. We do not believe that this is splitting the profession because the profession will still exist. What we do believe is that we should regulate only in a way that is proportionate to the risk presented to the public. Academics are engaged in research and do not present the same risks that practitioners treating individuals do. I have no doubt at all that the profession will regard itself as a profession and will continue to discuss its issues on that basis.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09050548000084"></a>The noble Lord also raised the question of why we were doing away with elections for professional members. We have discussed that issue in your Lordships&#146; House on many occasions. The council must be one that can provide effective leadership to the regulators&#146; work, and one which can fully engage with the profession and the public interest, as well as the NHS and the private sector and employer interest. By creating a system of independent appointments, the public and professions can be assured that people are being appointed because of their abilities, their track record, their achievements and their commitment to patient safety. In other words, they are not there as trade representatives; the registrants who have these qualities will be able to apply through a transparent process, and will not subject themselves to an election.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09050548000085"></a>Finally, the noble Lord asked what might happen in the future. The only thing I would say is that, if his own party wishes to influence the policy of the Conservative Party, he probably needs to have that discussion elsewhere. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09050548000088"></a><I>Motion agreed.</I></p>

<p><a name="09050548000089"></a><I>House adjourned until 8.30 pm.</I></p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09050549000002"></a>The first of these amendments is similar to an amendment to which I spoke in Committee, so I will not explain the detail of the clause, but I will say, as I said then, that it is lifted from Section 11 of the Planning Act, which provides for a suspension of the policy statement in the event of an unanticipated change in circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09050549000003"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, said that there was a distinction between the marine policy statement and the national policy statements in that national policy statements are to be used primarily by a single body, the IPC: and indeed primarily, but not I think exclusively, in decisions on a small number of projects. I accept the differences in those circumstances, but it is important to have a mechanism for suspension as well as for review, so I could not resist putting down Amendments 62 and 81, which would apply to marine plans in order to cover&#151;I am sorry, but no pun is intended here&#151;all the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09050549000004"></a>In Committee, the Minister was rightly concerned about certainty for everyone who is involved in the

We have always acknowledged that that is important, but should certainty prevail if it is the wrong certainty&#151;in other words, if circumstances have changed and made it the wrong certainty?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09050549000005"></a>My Amendments 74, 75, 87 and 88 are about the criteria that apply to decisions: criteria for departing from a policy. We debated at some length &#147;material considerations&#148;&#151;the term that is used in terrestrial planning&#151;and I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s letter, which I received after Committee and which deals with what the Government consider to be an equivalent provision, &#147;relevant considerations&#148;: the term that is used in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09050549000006"></a>I appreciate that there will be guidance, as the Minister&#146;s letter was careful to explain, on what the relevant considerations will be and which considerations should or should not be regarded as relevant. Guidance cannot alter primary legislation, however, so my concern that something that can be relevant but not significant has not been allayed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09050549000007"></a>The Minister&#146;s letter says that the context would make matters clear, and goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_150"></a><a name="09050549000033"></a>&#147;I believe that it is clear from the drafting that insignificant or trivial matters will not be sufficient to override the general principle of decisions being taken &#145;in accordance with&#146; the MPS/plan: the considerations before the decision-maker must actively indicate that the decision should not be taken in accordance with the plan. I would not consider it sufficient simply to say, for example, that there was &#145;another option available&#146;&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09050549000008"></a>I think that was dealing with some of the drafting in my amendment in Committee. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_151"></a><a name="09050549000034"></a>&#147;The guidance we produce will obviously make this very clear&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050549000024"></a>I am not reassured by that; Clause 49(5) requires &#147;conformity&#148;, which I assume is general and not a strict conformity. How, therefore, can guidance shift the emphasis as he suggests?</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09050549000009"></a>I thought that the next paragraph of his letter rather made my point for me. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_152"></a><a name="09050549000035"></a>&#147;We will aim as far as possible to give an indication in that guidance of the relative weight that should be given to different kinds of considerations. However, as the debate recognised, this will not always be possible because the &#145;relevance&#146; and significance of different considerations will depend to a large extent on the decision in question, the site affected, and the potential impact of the &#145;relevant consideration&#146; on both the project in question and the future possibility of achieving the plan&#146;s objectives. The consequences of the departure from the plan will also need to be borne in mind as a &#145;relevant consideration&#146; in their own right&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050549000025"></a>He ended by referring to having enough &#147;flexibility&#148; for the real world. I want that too, but not so much flexibility that we lose the prize of certainty. I remain concerned that there will be too much reliance on guidance getting it right when, if there is a crunch, reference will be made to the primary legislation. Guidance will be referred to, but will not override what is said in what will be the Marine and Coastal Access Act. I beg to move.</p>

I think that this amendment is trying to say, &#147;All applications must be suspended until we&#146;ve got this right. Because we don&#146;t want the applications in the pipeline to be based on those bad decisions, let&#146;s suspend part or all of the MPS until the review has taken place and the right framework is put in place&#148;. I support this amendment; there has to be some sort of mechanism for getting this right, either in the Bill or within guidance. I will be interested to know how the Minister proposes to deal with this.</p>

<a name="09050549000011"></a><b><a name="90505-0013.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09050549000041"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change &amp; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> My Lords, as the noble Baroness and the noble Earl have suggested, this group of amendments covers two interrelated issues. First, it covers the test for when a marine plan need not be in conformity with a marine policy statement or a decision may be taken other than in accordance with the MPS or a marine plan. There is also the question of suspending the MPS or plan while it is reviewed. I recognise that we debated these matters in Committee; I shall deal first with Amendments 62 and 81, which would introduce new powers to suspend the operation of all or part of the MPS or a plan while it is reviewed.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09050549000012"></a>The noble Lords have again raised a question that we discussed in Committee, of the contrast between how this is dealt with in the context of national policy statements under the Planning Act, and how we would deal with these matters under the MPS or plans. I know the noble Baroness thinks that, under the MPS, we ought to have the power of suspension in the circumstances that she and the noble Earl have described.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09050549000013"></a>Our problem is the impact and the number of public authorities and decision-makers which would be affected by a suspension of the MPS or marine plan. We think that it would be vast in comparison with the effect on the IPC, a single body, of suspending a national policy statement. Our worry is that it would be unreasonable to expect such a wide range of public authorities, including local authorities, coastal regulators, enforcement bodies and others, to keep a constant check on which parts of a plan or policy statement were in effect at any given time. We do not accept that it is necessary formally to suspend part of a policy statement or plan in order to review or amend it, even if, as the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, has suggested, we are aware that it has shortcomings.</p>

<a name="90505-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09050549000014"></a>In that situation, we would expect the policy authority or marine plan authority to make it known to the relevant decision-makers that their policy on a certain matter had moved on or was being reviewed. This would constitute a relevant consideration for decision-makers and marine users without the need to suspend any part of the document. It also places the emphasis on the policy or plan authority to ensure that affected decision-makers are aware, rather than expect all decision-makers to keep constant vigilance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09050549000015"></a>It might be helpful if I explain the difference we envisage between a review of a national policy statement and a review of the marine policy statement, which is directly linked to the question of suspension. The Planning Act contains detailed provisions on the review  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_526"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column 526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of national policy statements. Before beginning the review, the Secretary of State must consider whether circumstances have changed since the adoption of the policy statement in a way which was not anticipated at the time and whether the policy set out in the document may have been different had that change been foreseen. Following the review, the Secretary of State must make a decision on whether to replace or amend the national policy statement or to do nothing.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09050549000016"></a>In contrast, under this Bill, there is no formality connected with the review of the MPS. Therefore, the policy authorities are under a duty to review the MPS when they consider it to be appropriate, which essentially gives more flexibility. In practice, we would expect the review of the MPS to be a continuing activity for all the policy authorities to ensure that the MPS remains up to date and that the policies within it continue to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK marine area. This mechanism also enables the MPS to stay fully in effect while an amendment is being prepared. The progress of the preparation of that amendment will also be a relevant consideration, enabling decision-makers to take greater account of the emerging new policy as it moves towards finalisation and adoption.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09050549000017"></a>It certainly is not the case that we would expect flawed policy to continue to be applied without question, which brings me to the other amendments in this group relating to the relevant considerations test. In Committee, we discussed the circumstances under which decision-makers and planners might cite relevant considerations, and we found some common ground on the kinds of things which were likely to be relevant considerations.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09050549000018"></a>I also appreciate the noble Baroness's concerns that the word &#147;relevant&#148; does not equate to &#147;significant&#148;. But we have problems with her amendments which we believe would impose a higher threshold under this Bill than has been used successfully for many years in terrestrial planning legislation. Let me be clear: the existence of other considerations which may be relevant to the decision at hand is not the end of the test. Those considerations must also indicate that a course of action other than that indicated by the MPS or plan is, in this case, more appropriate. What is more, the consequences of not following the policy statement or plan should also be considered as relevant in their own right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09050549000019"></a>Again, I fully accept that the noble Baroness is right when she says that something may be relevant without being important. If that is the case, it would not be sufficient to indicate that the MPS or plan should not be followed. Decision-makers departing from the MPS or plans must give their reasons. I assure noble Lords that we will want to monitor this flexibility closely to ensure that it is being used and not abused. I give an assurance from the Dispatch Box that this matter will be closely monitored. I also make it clear that insignificant or trivial matters will not be enough to override the clear general principle that decisions should be taken in accordance with the MPS, or that plans should conform to the MPS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09050549000020"></a>We are debating how precise the situation should be and how much flexibility should be left in guidelines. I know that the noble Baroness is worried about the guidance. We are committed to consulting and providing guidance on the issue. As I said in my letter, we will attempt, as far as possible, to address the relative weight that is to be given to potential relevant considerations. The problem is that the noble Baroness would much prefer this to be in the Bill but that is very difficult to do. There will always be case-by- case decisions. The relative weight of a consideration will depend as much on the circumstances of the case as the question of what is relevant in the first place. That is why I said that we would attempt to give some general principles and broad priorities in so far as they are not already set out in the MPS or plan.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09050549000021"></a>The matters that have been raised are very legitimate. I doubt that we can give the precision that the noble Baroness seeks, but I hope she will accept my assurance that this will be monitored to make sure that trivial reasons are not used in the way that is feared. Also, there is a significant difference between the MPS and the NPS as regards suspensions. The MPS is, in essence, a more flexible mechanism, which will allow changes to be made more quickly than they would be in relation to the NPS. I hope the noble Baroness and the noble Earl will accept that, in resisting the amendments, I very much understand the points that they are making. I hope I have given some reassurance.</p>

My concern is whether it is adequate. That is not at all to be pejorative of the Minister; I am sure that he will understand that. It is a question of the relative status of legislation and guidance. As regards suspension, a review and possible alteration will inevitably take time, not least because of consultation. If consultation means anything, it means that there must be at least two options, otherwise what is there consult on? There must be the option of doing something and of not doing something. That is in the context of suspension as a measure that might have to be applied, pending review.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09050549000023"></a>Of course, we will read what the Minister has said about relevant considerations because the detail in that is very important.

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09050552000002"></a>Amendment 68 is the crucial one in the group. It reflects the fact that, when we debated an amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, in Committee, it became clear that there was some ambiguity in the wording of the Bill on the timescale available to the legislatures to scrutinise the marine policy statement. We explained then that it was not our intention to curtail the time that the legislatures would have to consider the marine policy statement to just the public consultation period and we promised that we would look at this again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09050552000003"></a>Amendment 68 and the other related amendments are a reflection of that further consideration. We have proposed amendments to Schedule 5 to make it clear that the period allocated to an appropriate legislative body or appropriate legislative committee for legislative scrutiny of the consultation draft will be specified by the policy authority. Amendments 67 and 69 make consequential changes to paragraph 9, while Amendment 64 makes a similar change to paragraph 5, as it sets out that the statement of public participation must state the period allocated for legislative scrutiny.

However, in recognition of the concerns expressed by noble Lords on this matter, our amendment will place a requirement on the authorities to carry out an appraisal of sustainability of the marine policy statement. My Amendment 65 requires that the relevant authorities carry out an appraisal of the sustainability of proposals for inclusion in the marine policy statement, that they should proceed only if the results of the appraisal indicate that it is appropriate to do so and that they should publish a report of the results alongside the consultation draft.

If the directives apply, we already have a legal obligation to comply with them and it is therefore not necessary to duplicate that in the Bill.

Amendment 70 seeks parliamentary scrutiny through a report being made to Parliament on the marine policy statements. The parallel provision in Amendment 84 relates to parliamentary scrutiny based on reports on the marine plan.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09050552000016"></a>To pick up on the debate two sets of amendments ago, the steps that have been taken, which the Minister referred to, are very welcome. Perhaps there was some confusion&#151;my noble friend&#146;s amendment in that grouping related more to the marine plan than to the MPS&#151;but some of the points remain relevant. Here we are seeking that there should be a report to the appropriate legislatures on an annual basis in connection with the marine policy statement and with regard to the marine plan, so that the appropriate authorities have an opportunity to set out the extent to which the MPS or the marine plan has been carried into effect and to say whether they believe that it is adequate, whether further

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09050552000017"></a>Much of what we have discussed in these debates, both in Committee and today, relates to work that will be done principally by Secretaries of State, Scottish Ministers, the devolved Administrations in Northern Ireland and Wales or public bodies such as the MMO. It is important that we remember the parliamentary dimension to this, especially given the length of time that we have devoted to these subjects, which are clearly of considerable importance; I do not think that anyone who has taken part would doubt that. That is why it is important that Parliament should have a regular opportunity to examine whether the mechanics and the framework that we are putting into place in the legislation are bearing the fruit, having the oversight and carrying forward the approach to marine conservation and the treatment of our marine resource in the way in which we as parliamentarians would wish them to.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09050552000018"></a>I say that also in the context of agreement with the devolved Administrations. It is very much to be welcomed that, in an area of considerable complexity, an agreement was reached. That shows that that can be done where good will applies. It was 10 years ago this week that we elected a Scottish Parliament and, indeed, a Welsh Assembly. We had executive devolution before then in the guise of the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office. What the people of Scotland and Wales voted for was some democratic oversight of that devolution. These amendments would at least give an entr&#233;e for the respective Parliament and Assembly to have oversight as to what Ministers are doing in pursuance of either an MPS or a marine plan.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09050552000019"></a>Following the precedent set earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Davies, I will not prejudge Amendment 92 in the group, which seeks a report on a three-yearly and, in some cases, a six-yearly basis. I think that it would be better to have it yearly. However, I note that Amendment 92 says:</p>
<ul><a name="09050552000067"></a>&#147;see subsections (3) to (7) ... see subsections (8) to (11)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050552000045"></a>That is a novel form of drafting. I cannot remember seeing that previously in a Bill. It may be something to be welcomed. I am all in favour of trying to put things into more readable English, rather than saying &#147;subject to&#148;, &#147;notwithstanding&#148; or whatever. Perhaps he could explain whether this is a novel departure that we should perhaps be welcoming. I beg to move.</p>

I should like to thank the Law Society of Scotland for putting this forward; I believe I received a prompt from it on that score. The amendment tabled looks so much neater than the raft included in the six tabled by the Government.</p>

<a name="90505-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09050552000021"></a>I only differ from the noble Lord in that I think the Government in their Amendment 93 are really proposing a much more practical approach where the reports are spaced out as up to three years. There is always a great danger in allowing politicians to meddle too much with organisations that are trying to evolve and carry out consistent policies.</p>

<a name="09050552000022"></a><b><a name="90505-0015.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09050552000086"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, I do not think that there is any disagreement in principle; it is really a question of the years. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, for his commendation. I would not like to claim that it is an entirely novel approach, but I certainly agree with him that it is very helpful to us trying to find our way through legislation. It is an example that one would like to see followed in the future.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09050552000023"></a>I agree wholeheartedly with the principle of building in a parliamentary dimension. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and the noble Duke are right to suggest that the debates we have had on the Bill show that there is intense parliamentary interest in the marine environment and ensuring that the provisions of the Bill are enacted appropriately. I have no doubt whatever that there will continue to be great interest. Therefore, we need to make sure that Parliament has opportunities to monitor effectively. Given the amount of secondary legislation that will come forward, there will be ample opportunities over the next year or two for Parliament to be kept appraised of the way in which the legislation will unfold.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09050552000024"></a>In relation to these particular amendments, we think that this is an important matter. My Amendments 92 to 97 build on a proposal put forward in Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. That would have required, as the other amendments in this group do, annual reporting to Parliament on the implementation of marine planning. It was suggested that would place marine planning authorities&#146; activities under greater scrutiny and act as a gentle spur. We accept that point. It will make legislators and the public more aware of progress on marine planning and allow them to apply pressure if they consider it falls short.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09050552000025"></a>Amendments 70 and 84, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Wallace and Greaves, also introduce reporting requirements on how the marine policy statement of each marine plan respectively has been carried into effect, amendments made and further steps to be taken. The issue of the timing is this: we expect that a single marine plan and the marine policy statement will take around two years to prepare. The concern that we have on annual reporting is that it might be too onerous and not particularly helpful because of the cycle in the production of marine plan and marine policy statement. The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, referred to that too. That is why we have come up with our own six-yearly reporting, which we think meets the cycle. It will enable these reports to be combined with those required on progress made in implementing the programme of measures required for each region under the marine strategy framework directive. Recognising, from my time of speaking on constitutional affairs at the Ministry of Justice, some benefits in legislation ceasing to operate after a certain time, we have also suggested this duty cease in 2030, by which time we will expect marine planning to be established. Having a sunset clause of this type ensures that the reporting duty does not continue indefinitely, if, for instance, the marine strategy framework directive is amended or revoked.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09050552000026"></a>At heart there is no disagreement on this. It is a question of whether the reporting mechanism is right. For the reasons stated, we think that annual reporting

That principle is well established and agreed among the parties. We could debate the length of time; I hear what the Minister says. It would certainly not be my intention, the principle having been established, to test the will of the House on one, three or six years. However, it is important and I welcome the amendment on the Government&#146;s part that there will be that kind of reporting and parliamentary scrutiny, for which some of us were calling in Committee. In these circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It must be the time of night, but when I read that a moment ago I wondered where else they would be for. In Committee, your Lordships rejected a requirement that marine plans must be in place by 2012. We thought that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, who moved the amendment in Committee, was right about the requirement for plans but that 2012 was over ambitious. My Amendment 71 changes &#147;may&#148; to &#147;must&#148;. One day I will understand why &#147;may&#148; meaning &#147;must&#148; is the right term. I have not yet.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09050552000029"></a>The linchpin of the Bill seems to be marine plans. It is counterintuitive, at any rate to me, that Clause 49 is permissive and not mandatory. We see plans not simply as restrictive but as establishing what can be done where, taking into account the sometimes competing or incompatible potential activities. It is important that there are plans, not least to establish the extent, if there is any extent, of an activity to which some people may object and object very strongly&#151;for example, wind farms. It is all a matter of balance, which we discussed at the previous stage. It is not obvious to me how there can be a balance if there are gaps in the patchwork of plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09050552000030"></a>We have not included a long-stop date. However, to anticipate a possible argument from the Government, we do not regard that as making the amendment meaningless because there must come a point, which probably depends on circumstances, at which a marine plan authority, which has dragged its feet for so long in not producing a plan, is in breach. I believe that a court would see it that way. I suppose that is the test that one must always have in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09050552000031"></a>Amendment 73, which states that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_169"></a><a name="09050552000065"></a>&#147;A marine authority must create a marine plan or plans for the whole of its marine planning region&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09050552000046"></a>is a little stronger than Amendment 72 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, who uses the words &#147;seek to ensure&#148;. It is not an absolute obligation. Amendment 73 goes further. A moment ago I referred to a patchwork and this would ensure blanket coverage. Amendments 71 and 73 go hand in hand.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09050552000032"></a>At the previous stage, in response to my noble friends Lord Greaves and Lady Miller, who had been chipping in on this debate, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_170"></a><a name="09050552000066"></a>&#147;Until we start to create plans we cannot be sure how extensive the coverage will need to be, so it is better not to prejudge the issue in legislation by requiring total coverage&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050552000047"></a>My noble friend Lord Greaves quite rightly came back with the comment that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050552000068"></a>&#147;the plans deal with the issues to a greater or lesser degree of detail according to the circumstances in their area. That is not to argue against having a plan for an area; it is just that there is not as much in that plan&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/2/09; cols. 1074-75.]</ul>
<p><a name="09050552000048"></a>My noble friend was absolutely right. I hope that the Government will not resort to that argument again. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Baroness has told the House, at that stage we voted, but unfortunately lost an amendment to the Bill which would have inserted a duty and timetable to roll out marine plans over the whole marine area. Therefore, this is about our ambition for the Bill and our wish that the Government share that ambition. The Minister made several objections to our amendments, one of which was that there were limits to what duties he could place on the marine authorities. In bringing back this weaker amendment, we have listened to that concern and seek to insert only a requirement to acknowledge the desirability of covering the whole of marine planning regions with a plan.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09050552000034"></a>Despite the efforts made by everyone to prevent unnecessary repetition on Report, following our very extensive debates on this part in Committee, many of the organisations involved in these proceedings have again raised their concerns about this point: not only the voluntary organisations which are members of the Wildlife and Countryside Link group and the Wildlife Trusts and the RSPB, but also the Countryside Council for Wales, the British Wind Energy Association and the Environment Agency. This is not surprising: marine plans are the key to delivering the policy of sustainable development. We have all spoken in support of an ecosystem approach. Comprehensive planning is the only way to deliver this. We have also all spoken in favour of pursuing a clear and consistent approach to marine management. Indeed, it is in the list of the MMO&#146;s core duties and is the reason that the joint MPS is so important. With no consistency clarified by comprehensive marine plans, what certainty is available to companies wishing to make the high levels of investment needed to meet our renewable energy targets? Of course,

Not only are they areas that will require more detailed plans than any others, they are to be established on a national basis. Decisions must be made consistently across the network if they are to succeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09050552000035"></a>The Government have tabled amendments in this area in response to related points we raised in Committee and we are very grateful to them for doing so. Their amendments will ensure that there is greater transparency, which is always a good thing. The ongoing reporting on marine planning might provide an incentive for authorities to produce marine plans, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, suggested in Committee, but this incentive would be better spelt out in primary legislation.</p>

I am afraid that I am a great disappointment to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, and to the noble Earl. Noble Lords have said it all but I simply add that marine plans need to cover the whole UK marine area or cherry-picking will arise with the licensing system. Since a large part of a marine plan comprises establishing the database and the baseline on which future decisions can be made, which will help to track the environmental quality of the area, it would be remiss not to opt for a fairly fast process of covering the whole marine area. Therefore, I support the amendments.</p>

However, the Government see difficulties with the amendments we are debating. Amendment 71 would create a duty to plan. In Committee I said that there were difficulties associated with imposing a legal duty to prepare marine plans. For example, if the marine plan authority withdraws from the marine policy statement, or if the marine policy statement is withdrawn by the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of State does not agree to a devolved Administration&#146;s plan, the marine plan authority will be unable to fulfil its duty to plan. In addition, if adopting a marine policy statement brings with it a duty to plan, it could be argued that it might deter some policy authorities from adopting marine policy statements. Therefore, there are genuine difficulties here. I question whether prescribing such detail in the legislation is the right course of action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09050552000038"></a>Amendments 72 and 73 would lay down that plans should be prepared for the whole of the marine planning region where the marine policy statement governs marine planning. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that his measure is supported by many organisations. However, I am not sure that there is unanimity of view on this matter. Many stakeholders have told the Government that they agree that the system needs to evolve and that we need to learn lessons as we go along. Until we start to create plans, we cannot be sure how extensive the coverage will

We are worried about prejudging the situation by putting this into legislation and by requiring total coverage, whether by a single plan or several.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09050552000039"></a>As there are different planning authorities around the UK, it is for each of them to decide where and when plans are needed and whether they entail full coverage of their planning area. We think that the most important consideration would be to plan the most appropriate way for the area concerned. That would almost certainly involve plans of different scales and sizes containing more or less detail depending on the data available, the needs of the area and the levels of activity requiring management and consideration. There is a question of proportion. There must be a question of how much value would be added by an obligation to prepare plans for the whole of the UK marine area, or even the whole of a marine planning region, particularly in the far reaches of the offshore regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09050552000040"></a>In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050552000069"></a>&#147;plans must be made in a proportionate manner, varying with regard to the amount of information available and the necessary detail. This would mean that there could be comprehensive plans across the whole marine area, without taking up too much unnecessary time or effort for plans that will remain less detailed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/2/09; col. 1068.]</ul>
<a name="90505-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09050552000041"></a>That point was made again tonight. It is deceptively inviting to go down that route. While I agree that planning must be proportionate, I am not sure that it is right that one could in certain parts of the marine area be much less detailed. The marine planning process is necessarily intensive and detailed, involving extensive public consultation and consideration of data and evidence. We cannot shortcut this process, which is set out clearly in Schedule 6, without undermining the quality of the plans being prepared and risking losing the confidence of those using the area and the plans. What is more, it is hard to see how such &#147;light touch&#148; plans containing little detail for large areas would be of any benefit for marine users and decision-makers above and beyond the policies already set out in the MPS. To that extent, the MPS can be seen as a strategic-level marine plan for the whole UK marine area. The MPS thus ensures that there is certainly no danger of there being areas of the sea which lack any kind of strategic approach to marine management.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09050552000042"></a>In practice, we expect that planning will be of most value in the inshore area, and I am happy to commit to ensure that we draw up plans to cover the English inshore region. We will put this requirement in the direction on planning that we give to the Marine Management Organisation, with which it is under a legal obligation to comply. The Welsh Assembly Government intend to develop a plan for the entire Welsh inshore region. That should give sufficient reassurance of our intentions on the matter. We have, of course, just debated our proposal to insert a new duty on a marine plan authority to report on the plans it has prepared and its intention regarding their amendment and the preparation of any further plans.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09050552000043"></a>In conclusion, I hope that noble Lords will understand that there is no lack of commitment in taking the legislation forward and wishing to see appropriate

Although my response has been technical to some degree, there is substance and legitimate reasons behind why I would caution the House against going down the route of these amendments. I hope that the assurance I can give regarding the inshore region of England and our assurance from the Welsh Assembly Government go some way to providing the reassurance that noble Lords would require.</p>

Do I understand his reservation to be that he does not see that the whole of the inshore area will be covered by the marine plans; or is it just the fact that this will take time and therefore he wants to have the freedom to make it in bits rather than the whole? Clearly, if one makes it in bits, surely the overall marine plan itself would not be as strong as if it had been made as a complete plan throughout the area.</p>

We can certainly commit to saying that, as the work goes forward, there will be a point where the whole of the English inshore region is covered. My concern goes wider than that. The implication, particularly of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is that if one goes across the whole area that can be covered by plans, perhaps some of the outer areas can be covered by a plan, because you do not have to do a lot of detailed work.</p>

<a name="90505-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09050553000002"></a>The point that I am making is that, none the less, you have to go through the process as set out in Schedule 6, which could involve you in a lot of work indeed.

I am not sure that I am wholly persuaded on the issue of coverage by his saying essentially that the process might prove to be a waste of time. I am putting that in quite simplistic language. The process may lead to something that is not very detailed; we are not prescribing detail in the amendments, but really seeking consistency of approach. I remain a bit worried that having no plan rather undermines the Bill for the areas for which there is no plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09050553000004"></a>On the issue of it not being possible to have a plan because of withdrawal, for instance, it seems to me that the Government should be looking for a way to ensure that the duty to have a plan produces the desired outcome of having a plan, rather than arguing that there might be reasons for an authority not to be able to produce a plan. I had better not try to draft on the hoof on that. It is my failing not to have anticipated the argument and produced an amendment that might have gone some way to meet it. However, given the time of night&#151;</p>

They would re-formulate some of the offences in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 so that they allow adequate account to be taken of the reason for the breach of the Act at the time that an assessment is made about whether an offence has been committed. Debates in another place indicated the widespread concern that, although it is right and proper that the  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requirements of the 2000 Act are observed and enforced, it may not be right and proper for every breach of those requirements to be pursued, particularly where there might be a very good reason for that breach.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000013"></a>It is helpful in this context to note that the Electoral Commission&#146;s proposed approach to the use of its new investigatory powers and civil sanctions, published in January 2009, suggests that the commission considers the public interest as a material factor in determining whether to proceed with a particular case. Notwithstanding this helpful confirmation of approach, some of the reporting requirements in the 2000 Act are formulated without any prior consideration being given to why non-compliance occurred; that is, the late submission of a donation report is in itself an offence. Consideration of why non-compliance happened is left to a separate defence which can subsequently be demonstrated by that showing,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000422"></a>&#147;all reasonable steps and ... all due diligence&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000291"></a>have been exercised.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000014"></a>That is a high test, requiring a person to show that &#147;all&#148; reasonable steps and due diligence have taken place. Further, this particular defence might be unnecessarily narrow. It suggests that at least some steps have been taken or considered which do not deal with a case where a person for a good reason mistakenly concludes that no report needed to be delivered. For these reasons, we were persuaded by the debates in another place that the existing position included an unhelpful formulation that could result in some inadvertent breaches being pursued without there being a proper examination of why the breaches occurred. These amendments provide that offences of late and incomplete reporting of donations and loans&#151;by parties, regular donees or treasurers&#151;are only committed if the breach is &#147;without reasonable excuse&#148;. In parallel, they remove the defence of taking,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000423"></a>&#147;all reasonable steps and ... all due diligence&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000292"></a>as it is no longer necessary.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000015"></a>Because each case is different, it is impossible to be prescriptive about what will and will not be a viewed as a &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;. A reasoned judgment will of course have to be made on the facts of each case and the relevant circumstances. However, I can say that &#147;reasonable&#148; imports an element of objectivity here: not just any old excuse will do. This approach ensures that there is flexibility to take account of any reason given for non-compliance without meaning that all a person has to do to avoid liability is to make up an excuse that sounds vaguely plausible.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000016"></a>I stress, for the avoidance of doubt, that the effect and intention of these amendments is not to absolve regulated persons of guilt for all unintended errors. It might well be that a really bad breach of the requirements of the Act, even if not deliberate, does not have a reasonable excuse and as such still constitutes an offence.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000017"></a>While we are sympathetic to concerns about the commission pursuing those who did not intend to breach the Act, we are equally clear that the public interest demands a stringent and well enforced regulatory regime. Any more blanket excuse that would allow unintended errors to go unpunished would risk incentivising ignorance of the law, which would over

We do not wish to create a situation in which a person who serially forgets to comply is absolved of any possible punishment simply because there was no intent to deceive, but we do think that a person who fails to comply should have a chance to show that there was an objectively good reason for doing so.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000018"></a>I am pleased that the commission has welcomed this approach. In its latest briefing on this Bill, the commission states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000323"></a>&#147;The Commission believes the proposed new defences are more proportionate, providing greater protection to those we regulate and more certainty to the Commission&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000019"></a>Our amendments strike the right balance between the twin aims of helping to ensure that inadvertent errors with good reason are not punished and ensuring that the regulatory system is not undermined by absolving of the consequences of their actions all those who did not intend to commit a breach. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000020"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09050556000451"></a>Lord Bates:</b> We welcome this amendment. The arguments that I shall deploy are very much those we have deployed in this Grand Committee, and in Committee and on Report in another place, for a defence of innocent mistake. This amendment goes very much towards that.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000021"></a>When the Minister responds, it would be good if he drew a line under what is potentially covered by a &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;, in terms of objectivity, that would not be covered by an amendment on an &#147;innocent mistake&#148;. Is there a major difference on a philosophical or legal point that we are missing? If so, it would be good to understand what that is in terms of the reach. As regards adjudicating objectively on when a reasonable mistake has been made, the Electoral Commission would be helped enormously if it included members with recent experience of political activity.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000022"></a>I appreciate that the Minister may be unable to respond today, but we have been talking about achieving a system of regulating and declaring donations in which the public can have confidence. The objective is not necessarily to be seen to be dishing out hard sentences or penalties for mistakes, but is very much to give the public confidence in their system. To what extent, therefore, does he feel it appropriate for the commission to have a role in providing training and education to people who have made an innocent or reasonable mistake in the completion or late submission of forms? Is that something that the commission could respond to in a way that says, &#147;Yes, we will not levy a civil penalty&#148;&#151;perhaps not a criminal penalty&#151;provided that the person undergoes training to ensure that a level of competence can be established. That would of course mean that a serial offender would have one less argument in their defence. I offer that not as a new idea, but one which has been used by the police, for example, who can offer someone a safe driving course instead of a penalty when they have slightly exceeded the speed limit. Something like that would give integrity to the system and I shall be interested to hear the Government&#146;s response. Otherwise we welcome the changes, which are in line with the arguments we made in another place.</p>

By using it in different contexts, you are going to get different interpretations. For example, on the issue of failure to deliver a proper statement of accounts, it could be a fairly good answer to say, &#147;They were scrutinised by a firm of chartered accountants of high standing and it made a mistake. We only submitted them&#148;. The excuse for not making a full report by a particular date may be of a different order from where you are relying on the expert evidence of someone like an accountant. How solid is this as statutory language?</p>

<p><a name="09050556000024"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09050556000453"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords who have spoken on this matter. First, on the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Neill, time will tell how solid it is. It represents a difference from the standard that has applied up until now, which is, as I said in opening, a harder standard. We are trying to avoid unnecessarily convicting too many putative defendants of offences. &#147;Reasonable excuse&#148; means there is a need for the reason for failure to be considered; inadvertent breach would not necessarily be, and often might not be, a reasonable excuse. Innocent mistake provides a much more blanket defence, absolving all inadvertent breaches. If a treasurer is ill and therefore cannot get his returns in on time, that might constitute a reasonable excuse, but a blanket defence of innocent mistake would not incentivise understanding and compliance with the law. All breaches, if unintentional, would not be punishable.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000025"></a>The noble Lord asked about settled case law in this field. We have all met the phrase, of course, in a number of Acts of Parliament. There is no settled case law in the context of the 2000 Act, but there are many other offences within that Act which contain the language. We are using consistent terminology that will make it easy for the commission to decide more fairly, on the facts of each case, whether or not an offence has been committed. We will have to wait and see whether it will work more satisfactorily than the present higher test. I am comforted, to some extent, by the fact that the commission prefers this choice of language to that which exists at present.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000026"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bates, for his welcome of the amendment in principle. He asked for an example. At the most basic level&#151;I have already used one about someone being ill&#151;an example could be a treasurer whose spouse is taken suddenly ill. If there is a requirement on him or her to get the return off rapidly but he or she fails to do so because other matters are obviously more important at the time, he or she would commit the offence unless there was a defence of reasonable excuse. That circumstance might be considered by the commission to be a reasonable excuse for the returns arriving 24 hours later than they should otherwise arrive. We can all think of examples.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, asked an interesting question about whether the commission can provide education training. The first question to ask is whether there is an offence. If there is no offence, that is more difficult, except on a voluntary basis, although I am sure that the Electoral Commission will give guidance

However, if an offence has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, an enforcement undertaking, which is one of the sanctions that can be imposed under the Bill, agreed with the commission, might be to undertake some sort of training, or a discretionary requirement, which is another sanction, might be imposed to undertake training. That explains quite well why the sanctions that we are trying to introduce for offences are flexible&#151;they need to address the various needs away from the breaches. Therefore, the answer to the noble Lord&#146;s question is that education training is possible and may happen, but we will have to see how it works out.</p>

On the other hand, there is the treasurer who does not have it in his mind at any stage when he should do. That is the difference.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000033"></a>Members associations are a formal category of regulated recipient, or donee, under the 2000 Act. This means that they are required to report donations and loans to the commission in a similar way to political parties. These associations are diverse and can have fairly loose structures&#151;the legislation does not require specific posts or organisational arrangements. Indeed, the definition of what is and is not a members association is pretty broad. It is defined as an organisation &#147;composed wholly or mainly of members of a political party&#148; that is not a party or party accounting unit.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000034"></a>This loose arrangement is desirable as it allows a multiplicity of bodies to organise and flourish. A quick glance at the Electoral Commission&#146;s registers indicates that organisations as diverse as the Conservative Christian Fellowship, Progress and the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Party have all reported donations in their capacity as members associations. This diversity is a feature of our democratic system. Members associations should be encouraged, and nothing we propose is intended to hamper their existence or radically alter what is required of them.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000035"></a>However, it has come to our attention that, in the event of a members association failing to comply with the reporting requirements which attach to it, it might not always be possible to ascertain who is responsible for that failure. After all, the legislation in its current form does not require the members association positively to identify to the commission who is responsible for dealing with its donations. Moreover, it is not possible to sanction the association itself in the event of a failure not resulting from the actions of an individual. This situation cannot be acceptable, given the importance of a robust and enforceable regulatory system. As such, these amendments propose measures to clarify the liability of members associations in the event of failures to comply with the reporting requirements applying to them.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000036"></a>The amendments provide that, when a members association does not already have a treasurer and is in receipt of a donation, or enters in to a loan which is

A notice appointing the responsible person must be submitted to the Electoral Commission within the 30-day time period and include relevant details such as name and address of the association and the individual&#146;s name and address. The notice must be signed by the responsible person and on behalf of the members association; it lasts for one year and can be renewed, modified or terminated during the course of that year, as set out in the clause.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000037"></a>In the event of a failure adequately to comply with the reporting requirements, that responsible person will be liable. When a members association fails to appoint a responsible person, in these circumstances that will be an offence. In contrast with the current liability provisions in the 2000 Act, these amendments provide that the members association itself can be sanctioned for both a failure adequately to comply with the reporting requirements, and as a new offence, the members association would be liable for a failure to appoint a members association where one is required.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000038"></a>This is a sensible and proportionate measure which clarifies liability without compromising the status of members associations more widely. I am pleased that the Electoral Commission has recognised that these amendments are desirable and fully supports them. Its recent briefing note on the Bill said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000344"></a>&#147;The new requirements are ... targeted at circumstances where a breach of the law is most likely to affect confidence in the transparency and integrity of political finance.

I take this opportunity to seek further clarification. There may be circumstances in which some people may be categorised as members associations under the terms of this Bill but may not be aware that they are categorised as such. How will they be contacted and told that they come within the remit? Whose responsibility is that? Is it that of the party to which they are affiliated or linked in some way, whose members make up the bulk of their membership? If so, that is an added requirement on party organisations and it would be helpful to know that. Furthermore, how will it be enforced? Have the commission or Ministry of Justice made any estimates as to how many of these associations are out there and who they are&#151;and, therefore, how this additional element will be supervised and policed? Those are the only two points that we wish to raise at this stage.</p>

In a sense, it would not matter until they either got a donation of more than &#163;7,500 or were offered an impermissible donation of more than &#163;500. It is the responsibility of citizens to know the law. The definition of &#147;members association&#148; in the 2000 Act is unchanged by the amendments. Nor do the amendments change how members associations have come to be known through custom and practice. The amendments solely fill a loophole&#151;I do not like that word because I do not believe that a loophole has ever been exploited. Rather, they address a lack of clarity that has emerged as a result of one or two events in recent years by making it absolutely clear that if you are going to be a members association and receive donations, you must have a responsible person who can be identified.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000046"></a>During the passage of the Bill, concerns have been raised regarding what some have seen as a burdensome and time-consuming administrative side of compliance with the requirements of PPERA. The Government believe that we must always prioritise the upholding of the law, which helps reinforce public confidence in the  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC176"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>overwhelming probity of our political system and our politicians above any administrative burdens that politicians, as individuals, may encounter. However, we have said throughout this process that we are happy to listen to concerns and seek reasonable solutions.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000047"></a>We were therefore persuaded to amend the Bill by incorporating Clause 10, by which holders of elective office may&#151;I emphasise, may&#151;appoint a person to help them with the practical duties of compliance. The clause does not compel the appointment of such an officer, but it is helpful in that it ensures that such appointments can be made on a statutory basis.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000048"></a>Ahead of the introduction of the clause on Report in another place, the Electoral Commission confirmed that it was content with it and has restated that view in its latest briefing. It is our intention to ensure that breaches of the rules are effectively investigated and properly sanctioned, but in parallel with that, it is our intention that inadvertent, honest mistakes be minimised. Compliance with PPERA is not intended as a challenge in its own right. PPERA&#146;s overriding objectives were to bring greater transparency to political finances and to ensure that rules as to permissibility of political donations and spending are adhered to. This constituted an important stride forward. Allowing the appointment of compliance officers now is in recognition of the challenges that such compliance might represent for busy individuals. It does not in any way detract from these principles, but is meant to support them.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000049"></a>Government Amendments 99 to 104 make minor technical amendments to the existing Clause 10, which I shall try to deal with speedily. We are introducing them to bring a little extra clarity to the process involved in the formal appointment of a compliance officer. They are specifically concerned with the period for which a notice of renewal is valid. The clause, as currently drafted, stipulates that an original notice to the commission of the appointment of a compliance officer may be renewed again during the final month of the original notice period. However, although it is clear that the original notice is one year in duration, it is not as clear as it might be on how long the renewal notice will last. The current drafting could be read to imply that a renewal could last indefinitely, which is not the outcome that we intended. That would be a regrettable impression which we address here with this minor amendment to clarify that the reappointment of a compliance officer lasts for one year. This clarification is made by Amendment 101. Amendments 99, 100 and 102 are consequential.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000050"></a>Amendments 103 and 104 clarify the processes for altering or terminating a compliance officer notice. Amendment 103 allows that a &#147;notice of alteration&#148; may be signed by the incoming compliance officer, and Amendment 104 provides that where a &#147;notice of termination&#148; is signed by both the officeholder and the compliance officer there is no requirement for the commission to take steps to inform either of them.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000051"></a>Amendment 106 would ensure that a compliance officer appointed under Clause 10 will be able to take responsibility for reporting regulated transactions&#151;in other words, loans&#151;in addition to donations. That

However, we do not wish to create a situation in which a compliance officer may take statutory responsibility for the reporting of loans but not for the reporting of transactions. The amendment rectifies that discrepancy.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000052"></a>I take the opportunity to remind noble Lords that the new provisions do not absolve the holders of elective office from their own liability under the 2000 Act for submitting reports to the Electoral Commission that are accurate and on time. They create the option of appointing a compliance officer who may be jointly liable for complying with the rules. It does not remove the responsibility for compliance from the officeholder himself. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000053"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09050556000463"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I thank my noble friend for the amendments. I was confused when I first read this clause because it raised a whole lot of questions in my mind. The amendments have sorted out, or at least rectified, some of my queries, but I still have a couple of questions. The first concerns the elective office. I am not sure who that covers as no list is available. Secondly, how will we make people aware that this is a possibility, and what incentive will they have for appointing a compliance officer? I am not opposing the principle because I understand that anything that will take away the burdens from local officers will make a big difference. I am happy with the concept but there are one or two queries still in my mind.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000054"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09050556000464"></a>Lord Bates:</b> We, too, very much agree with the amendment&#151;or perhaps I should say not &#147;very much&#148;, in the sense that an additional capability is being offered here. However, if as the Minister stated on Report in the Commons on 9 February, and as the Minister has repeated in this Committee this afternoon, it does not absolve officeholders from responsibility for compliance with their obligations under Schedule 7 to PPERA, I question the need for an additional compliance officer to be appointed. By all means someone can be appointed to handle the paperwork, but does it need to be another person who is registered if the person who stands for elective office is ultimately responsible for what happens?</p>

My noble friend Lady Gould asked what an &#147;elected officer&#148; means. Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act defines a holder of relevant elective office as either:</p>
&#147;(a) member of the House of Commons; (b) member of the European Parliament elected in the United Kingdom; (c) member of the Scottish Parliament; (d) member of the National Assembly for Wales; (e) member of the Northern Ireland Assembly; (f) member of&#151; (i) any local authority in any part of the United Kingdom, including the Common Council of the City of London but excluding a parish or community council, or (ii) the Greater London Assembly; or (g) Mayor of London or elected mayor&#148;.
<p><a name="09050556000293"></a>Therefore, it is a wide definition of all those elected under our systems.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000056"></a>How to make people aware of the existence of the elective office is a more difficult question, but I think that elected politicians&#151;certainly at the other end of this Palace&#151;will know about it. The idea is that there should be some Electoral Commission guidance on this but it is up to individual officeholders to decide whether they want to appoint one. We do not propose to encourage the appointment; it is absolutely up to elected members. This proposal is intended to help those members rather than be something that we impose on them in any sense.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000057"></a>The noble Lord asked me about legal requirements. As I have already said, they remain the same, so there is no policy intention that every officerholder should have one&#151;indeed, we do not expect everyone to have one.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000058"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, in his turn, questioned the need for an additional compliance officer. The need is as expressed in debate in another place, where a number of Back-Benchers are at some stage faced with quite complicated double reporting. They are universally very busy looking after their constituents&#146; interests. During the debate, the Government listened to representations about how it might be helpful to be able to appoint such an officer to an individual member to help them with this difficult but important task. That is the reason for it. It seemed to find general support then and I am glad that it does here today.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000059"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09050556000466"></a>Lord Neill of Bladen:</b> Would the Minister take a question arising from his reference to Clause 10? I want to know who these officeholders are. It strikes me as curious that they are not required to have a home address in the United Kingdom. That is set out in relation to compliance officers in new paragraph 18 proposed under Clause 10. At line 33 on page 9 of the Bill, new paragraph 18(2)(b) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000424"></a>&#147;the officer-holder&#146;s home address in the United Kingdom, or (if there is no such home address) the office-holder&#146;s home address elsewhere&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000294"></a>Exactly the same thing happens with the responsible person. It seems rather odd that people who have great responsibilities and are discharging important duties do not have to live here.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000372"></a>&#147;Does he agree that we cannot arrive at the point at which one party can have a veto over change if it were clearly what the overwhelming majority of voters concluded would enable greater public trust to be restored in such matters?&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Political Parties and Elections Bill Committee, 20/11/08; col. 414.]</p>

<p><a name="09050556000295"></a>That should be our text. If we are going to seek always a consensus at the lowest common denominator, we shall not be able to in any way meet the expectations of the public. I give full credit to the Minister, his team, his department and the Government for introducing the Bill, but if it remains as weak as it is at the moment on this vital issue, the public will regard us all as having wasted an important opportunity, one that may not come again for some years. As we all know, the legislative timetable is such that we are not always able to address issues speedily when they are first brought to our attention.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000063"></a>Amendment 108 seeks to insert a new clause which absolutely follows the near agreement in the Hayden Phillips discussions. It would introduce a &#163;50,000 cap on donations from a single individual or organisation in any given year. This is entirely in line with the Phillips recommendations, which I shall turn to again in a moment, and is key to proposals on our side of your Lordships&#146; House to take the big money out of politics. Wealthy individuals, organisations and companies should not be able to buy influence, whether through policies or peerages. The inequality of influence generated by massive donations runs entirely counter to democratic principles and certainly erodes public trust.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000064"></a>I shall not go all the way though the Hayden Phillips recommendations, but I want to read his rationale. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000373"></a>&#147;At the 2005 general election it was clear that the two main parties were each determined that they should not be outspent by the other. The combined expenditure in the 12 months leading up to the election rose to around &#163;90 million, as against about &#163;65 million in the 2001 election. The increase came about despite the controls on general election campaign expenditure introduced in 2000. Driven by a determination to gain a competitive advantage over their opponents, it is no surprise that the parties will seek large donations to fuel their spending. If we are to arrest this pattern, we must address both the income and expenditure sides of the equation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000296"></a>That is a simple summary not just of the responsibility laid on us in this Committee but on Parliament generally. It is laid on us after very careful discussion and negotiation within the inter-party talks, chaired by Sir Hayden Phillips.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000065"></a>His summary was as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000374"></a>&#147;I believe that there is an emerging consensus that ... the status quo, in which there are no caps on donations, is unsustainable and therefore donations to parties should be limited; and ... restrictions on donations should be buttressed by measures to prevent breaches of the new regulations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000297"></a>He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000375"></a>&#147;We do not yet have a consensus on the level and scope of a donations limit. This must now be addressed in direct talks between the parties. I would encourage them to work towards a long-term solution which is common to all parties. But a common  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC182"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>approach cannot be delivered in the short term. It will be necessary to have a transitional period during which parties are able to adapt to the future regime. What matters is that the solution is fair and sustainable and it is arrived at through agreement&#148;.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000066"></a>I regard Parliament as the place where agreement is reached between the parties, not least in your Lordships&#146; House where Cross-Benchers have an important contribution to make on these issues. The rest of us are, to some extent, interested parties. It is two years since Hayden Phillips published those recommendations&#151;it was in March 2007&#151; after careful consideration. It therefore seems to me that it should be up to Parliament to give a lead on what should happen next. We should not expect the issue to be kicked back to the representatives of the political parties, and certainly it should not be discussed in secret behind closed doors. It should be discussed in the nation&#146;s debating chamber: in Parliament.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000067"></a>In the debate in the other place on a new clause along the lines I have indicated, tabled and introduced by my honourable friend Mr David Howarth, the Conservative spokesman from the Front Bench said that the Bill was a tinkering exercise rather than an overhaul, but that the Conservative Party would remain willing to seek that overhaul. Mr Andrew Tyrie, to whom I have already made reference today, argued in that debate that the intentions of new Clause 1 went to the heart of what we are trying to achieve in any reform of party funding, which is to restore trust in the source of donations. He said that he would like to support new Clause 1 in principle, as his Front Bench team probably would.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000068"></a>Successively in the other place and in your Lordships&#146; House at Second Reading, Ministers have been saying, &#147;There is no consensus. There cannot be any consensus. We are not reaching consensus&#148;. Yet it would seem there really are grounds for believing that a consensus could be reached. Here are substantial arguments from the Conservative Party, which seems to believe that we could and should reach that consensus. No doubt there are members of the Labour Party in both Houses who take that view, too. What seems to be lacking is the Government&#146;s willingness to give a lead. It may be because they are reluctant to tackle this issue until that of trade union contributions to political parties is also tackled. Hence, we have linked with Amendment 108 Amendment 109, which deals with this issue. I hope that my noble friend Lord Rennard will speak more substantially to that amendment.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000069"></a>Members of the Committee will recognise that we have sought to produce a holistic package, just as the Hayden Phillips talks sought to produce a holistic package so that everybody could see that there was a fair and equal approach to these issues. I shall not say any more at this stage, because I am looking forward very much to hearing from other noble Lords, not least the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, who speaks with great authority on these issues and who has endorsed our Amendment 108. When the Minister and others have contributed, perhaps I may come back. Meanwhile, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000070"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09050556000472"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I was waiting to see whether the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, would come in first and talk about the trade unions. As the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said, the two issues are linked  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC183"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and, therefore, one cannot talk about one without talking about the other&#151;at least to a degree.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000071"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. I think that everyone is saying that we must arrive at consensus. The problem is that nobody can arrive at what that consensus should be, which is why the Sir Hayden Phillips talks collapsed. Although everybody wanted a consensus, that consensus was not arrived at. It is the detail that is the important factor, not the fact that everyone wants to do something about this. It is very clear from all the discussions that a great deal of complexity has to be dealt with when looking at this issue. I sincerely hope that some agreement can be reached at some point. At the moment, I do not think that to put such an amendment into the Bill is the answer. I think that we have to reach consensus.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000072"></a>One thing that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, did not refer to except in passing when he talked about us all spending too much at general elections&#151;he talked about the main two political parties spending enormous amounts of money, with which I might well agree&#151;was that, if the amendment were to become part of the Bill, there would be a shortfall of something like &#163;5 million to &#163;6 million in what the political parties could spend. That is quite a lot of money. Both the Committee on Standards in Public Life in 1998, which I am sure we will hear more about, and the Sir Hayden Phillips review of 2007 said that if there was to be a cap on donations we would have to look at an increase in state funding. No mention was made of that by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. I do not think that the moment is right to suggest to the public that we should look to state funding for political parties. Again, that is why I do not think that the amendment is appropriate at this time. However, we need to have the debate and continue to have it until, maybe, some great minds will come round and we will be able to come to some conclusion.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000073"></a>I wanted to ask the Minister a question before coming to the trade union side of this matter. If this amendment was carried, would public funds such as the Short money be affected by this amendment and also be capped? That would have quite a serious affect on opposition parties. On the trade unions, I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, has not made his case, and I think that I shall not make my comments at this point but wait until he has made his so I can respond to them properly. I shall make one comment only about the trade unions&#151;that they are, perhaps, the most regulated of all bodies. We shall see how the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, responds to that and I shall come back to it.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000074"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09050556000473"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> As the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, is so anxious that I speak, I feel obliged to rise to my feet immediately. I thank her for anticipating what I might say. Before I make a few remarks about trade unions, I shall make a few general points about the package within these amendments, which begins with the proposal in Amendment 108 for a &#163;50,000 cap.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000075"></a>I will not say a great deal, because I stand by my remarks in the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Bill in 2000, when I proposed such a cap a number of times and made most of my arguments. Since that day,  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC184"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I very much welcome the conversion of large elements of the Conservative Party to that suggestion, and the recognition by all the major parties when they sat around with Sir Hayden Phillips to discuss this, that perhaps &#163;50,000 was the appropriate level. Since then, I confess that there may have been a need in terms of the reputation of politics to go even further than I suggested in 2000. Things would be healthier if there were a substantially lower limit. All of us who observed and were delighted by President Obama&#146;s victory in the States will be aware that individual contributions to his campaign were capped at a mere $2,800. With the introduction of a spending cap it is possible to have healthy and vigorous democratic debate. The principle behind that is that power should lie with the voters, not the donors. We need to hold the arms race on funding.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000076"></a>On the two areas which the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, raised, first is the obvious implication, which I accept entirely, that if there were to be a cap on very large donations, as was recognised during the Hayden Phillips talks, there would need to be alternative funding for political parties to state their case. The principle must be that democracy does not come free, but I also accept and emphasise in relation to this overall package that there could not possibly be a case for any increase in taxation to pay for democratic political activity, nor should there be cuts in services to things like schools and hospitals. We have an element of state funding, and perhaps those who speak from the Conservative Benches might tell me whether or not they accept that Short money and the policy development fund are measures of state funding. I believe that they are and that measures such as those need to be extended, but this must be on the basis that savings need to be made elsewhere in how the Government spend our taxpayers&#146; money.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000077"></a>Previously in debates on this subject I have said that there needs to be increased support to pay for democracy and I have made suggestions regarding, for example, the Government&#146;s national advertising budget. When I first suggested that it was excessive and had risen significantly since 1997, it was some &#163;200 million nationally. I also suggested that that budget is often targeted for more partisan purposes than is sometimes proper for government advertising. The scale of that budget has increased to something like &#163;300 million and it would not be difficult to suggest that if the government advertising budget were reduced by only some 10 per cent, the parties could state their case, rather than allowing the Government to put forward their propaganda in a partisan way as they occasionally do with their advertising spending. That is why my case is sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000078"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09050556000474"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I am sorry to interrupt, but can the noble Lord give some examples?</p>

<p><a name="09050556000079"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09050556000475"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> Perhaps I can please the noble Baroness by giving first some of the most notorious examples under the previous Conservative Government, when they attempted to suggest that they cared passionately about finding jobs for people. There were huge adverts in national newspapers about how the Government  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC185"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were working very hard in this area. Yet all the adverts appeared in affluent areas where people were not genuinely unemployed and the adverts did not seem to appear in other areas. If you were genuinely trying to suggest that this was an opportunity for people to find work, you would perhaps have advertised in those areas, rather than in the more marginal areas where jobs appeared to be plentiful and unemployment was low.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000080"></a>At the moment, one might accept that entirely legitimate government advertising was on things like the potential flu pandemic. I have no doubt that there is widespread advertising in other areas, such as on the introduction of the so-called Australian points system on immigration to advise employers about what they have to do to conform with government regulations. I do not believe that this was the most cost-effective way of telling employers what they have to do in terms of policing the Australian points system. But it was very good way perhaps of reassuring voters through public advertising, paid for by the taxpayer, that the Government were doing something about a problem which they said needed to be addressed. My suggestion is that somebody independent should vet government advertising, reduce the bill significantly, give some of the money back to the taxpayer and use other parts of the budget to allow the parties to state their case democratically. At the moment, we have state funding for things like Short money and delivery of council election addresses. The implication of a cap of &#163;50,000 is then to say that you have to do something else instead.</p>
<h5><a name="09050556000081"></a><I>4.30 pm</I></h5>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000082"></a>I also recognise that part of the overall package of fairness is to address some of the anomalies in trade union funding. While there might be significant regulation within the trade unions at the moment, some things about how the trade unions give their funds to the Labour Party are not right and should be reformed. It is incumbent on the Labour Party to accept significant measures of reform in its trade union funding as part of its overall package. We nearly got there in the Hayden Phillips talks. My impression is that the Labour side came close to accepting what effectively is put forward now by my noble friend Lord Tyler and me in Amendment 109, which is based very closely on the Hayden Phillips report.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000083"></a>Informed consent is the essential principle. The argument is often made on the Labour side that individual trade union members are deciding with their &#163;3, &#163;10 or &#163;15 that they wish to be members of the Labour Party and wish that sum of money to go to it. That is invariably done through an affiliation system, yet it is a system in which the number of members of the Labour Party affiliated by particular trade unions is often greater than the number of members paying their political levy. If, for example, a union affiliates 110,000 members but has 100,000 members paying their political levy, where is the informed consent of the 10,000 members? Clearly, it does not exist.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000084"></a>There is a general appetite in this country for saying that large donors, whether individuals, private companies or trade unions, should not have excessive influence over the political process. We all know that cash  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC186"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>counts in politics. We should deal with all these problems together, for all the parties at the same time, whether they relate to individual donors, companies and the trade unions.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000085"></a>It may not strengthen my case with a number of noble Lords present to note that, this weekend,  Charles Clarke, the former Home Secretary, argued that among the things that the Government are not  addressing is the need for fundamental reform of political financing in this country and that part of that necessary reform was put forward in the Hayden Phillips proposals&#151;namely, the reform of trade union financing in particular of the Labour Party, as put forward in our Amendment 109.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000086"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09050556000476"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I have no option but to stand up and respond to that. I found the noble Lord&#146;s argument on government advertising highly spurious. Are we suggesting that things which the Government have implemented by parliamentary decision, such as the non-smoking or seat-belt laws, should not be allowed to be advertised on television? That would be absolute nonsense. Those are issues that the public have to know about.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000087"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09050556000477"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> I am not for a minute suggesting that some of the necessary public health information, for example, on the smoking ban, should not be advertised. What I am suggesting is that the total budget for it is excessive, having grown enormously during an era of spin in the past 12 years, and could be reduced significantly. There is clear evidence that some of that advertising is not about public health information, for example, but promoting the policies of the Government in a partisan way. I quoted one example from the previous Conservative Government and the introduction of the Australian points system as an example of the Labour Government advertising improperly for party political purposes.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000088"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09050556000478"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I thank the noble Lord for his intervention, but it does not influence my thinking. The noble Lord&#146;s first example was of the Conservative Government on unemployment. It is not for me to argue the case for the Conservatives when they were in government, but I would have thought that anything that helped to reduce unemployment was well worth doing. As for the political parties being able to take that space, we obviously have three party political broadcasts that other political parties can use. That is not only at election times, but at other times too, so there are other avenues for free broadcasting by the political parties.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000089"></a>On the trade unions, I start, with great respect, with a quote from the Neill Committee on Standards in Public Life in 1998, which said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000376"></a>&#147;No change should be made in the law relating to trade unions and their political funds&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000298"></a>That was sound. However, I accept that there still might need to be some tightening up of procedure. The trade unions have accepted that. They are prepared to look at their own situation, such as full affiliation of the levy-paying membership and how that affects things, and see if they cannot look at doing that.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC187"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000090"></a>I must make the trade unions&#146; position clear because an awful lot of false information is given. The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, referred to possible breaches of the position. However, between 2000 and 2006 the certification officer received only three complaints regarding political funds; two were withdrawn and one was not upheld. Certainly, no complaints have been justified. The 10-yearly ballots of trade union members show continuing support for trade unions having political funds; I declare an interest, as I was the officer responsible at the time and worked to implement those 10-yearly ballots,.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000091"></a>We must be clear that there is absolute transparency in trade union funding. Through the Electoral Commission, any member of the public can look and see how much an affiliated trade union gives to the Labour Party. They can see those political funds&#146; income and expenditure from the certification officer&#146;s annual report, and the numbers of those who pay in and opt out. As I probably said many years ago, that can be compared with some companies and unincorporated associations, where the public cannot even know the names of the individuals behind the donations.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000092"></a>As I said at the beginning, the trade unions&#146; political activities are more tightly regulated than those of any other organisation. To argue that something is not quite right in the receipt and expenditure of trade union funding is completely wrong. These two things go together. Putting a cap on donations at this point would be wrong if we are to look at the question of public funding, which has not been responded to and no doubt will be: how much public funding might be necessary to ensure that the democratic process works well? Now is certainly not the moment for us to talk about public funding. We have had that debate for the past 30 years. There has been a gradual increase in public funding, and we have reached the point at which we should not put any more into the electoral procedure.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000093"></a>As has been proved by all the debates and the lack of consensus, this is a much bigger debate than the amendments suggest. Putting them in the Bill will not satisfy that debate at all.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000094"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09050556000479"></a>Lord Marland:</b> One cannot help but agree with the sentiment of the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler.

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000095"></a>Clearly we must have transparency. We cannot have individuals&#151;or unions for that matter&#151;or organisations buying political parties or their policies. I am a bit cautious about the comments on public trust; a lot of it is a media storm which creates the lack of public trust. Having been involved in Sir Hayden Phillips&#146;s negotiations, the stumbling blocks were twofold. We could not get an agreement on a cap on union funding, on transparency or on an opt-out by union members from donating via the union to a political party. There is still strong evidence that pressures are brought to bear on union members not to opt out. Secondly, we could not get an agreement on the unfair advantage of

The report by Hayden Phillips, which was done with great endeavour, unfortunately disappeared.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000096"></a>It is hard to look at the two amendments coupled together. One has to do with trade unions, how they raise their money, give it to a party and how limitations are imposed. The other is about a &#163;50,000 cap on donations. Why does not each party impose a &#163;50,000 cap? It may help noble Lords to know that when I was responsible for the recent mayoral election we self-imposed a &#163;50,000 cap on donations. We also did it in the Euro elections and the local elections. By and large it was possible to run the general working expenditure of our party with a &#163;50,000 cap on donations. In fact, it was breached twice&#151;once when someone bid &#163;70,000 for something in an auction, for which we were very grateful, and the second time was when we were leaderless for six months. We were desperate for money; very few people were coming forward and various candidates were dipping into the trough of our donors. It was difficult to keep the centre going.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000097"></a>There are another two occasions when a political party cannot live within the cap. The first is capital expenditure. We moved office as a party and needed a new computer system, which would cost several million pounds. We could not say to our suppliers, &#147;Would you mind if we drip this out for four or five years while our &#163;50,000 donations come in to pay for the new system, the new office or for any other major capital expenditure we need?&#148;.</p>

That happens in the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrat Party, and it certainly happens in the Conservative Party. Ours is an extensive laid-down campaign, which is very transparent and has a limitation on how much a candidate is allowed to raise. That still means uncertainty about the donor base, but candidates go to the common&#151;for want of a better word&#151;donors. I hope that that clarifies the noble Lord&#146;s very good point.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000100"></a>Returning to my point, the two occasions when a party cannot function on a &#163;50,000 cap are, first, the general election&#151;when our party had to raise &#163;30 million in a period of 12 months&#151;and no Short money, for want of a better expression, is available to support the campaign, and, secondly, when we have capital expenditure. Sentiment would drive me towards supporting this amendment but, because there is no practical solution to satisfying these two substantial financial requirements, it is not possible for me to do so, although I strongly support Amendment 109.</p>

I spent my entire business life in marketing, advertising and public relations. If you are skilful enough, it is comparatively easy to get even the most hard-headed businessman&#151;and, by definition, the most hard-headed party leader&#151;to spend more than they need to.

<p><a name="09050556000103"></a>I believe passionately that there should be some contribution from the public. That is the cost of democracy. However, frankly, the time when that could have been introduced was during the fat years, which have now gone. It should have been brought in during the past 10 years but now we are stuck with whatever we have. Therefore, I think that, whatever may come of this amendment or the deliberations on the Bill, as a matter of urgency we have to get together and agree some sort of limit.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000104"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09050556000483"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I try to speak briefly on amendments which are not my own and I want to say only a very few words. I cannot see how a &#163;50,000 cap on donations will work, the simple reason being that it is very easy to circumvent through foreign donations. You simply spread the donations through a number of routes and thereby circumvent the donations regime domestically. There is only one way to sort out this problem. The Liberal Democrats know it because they are moving amendments which basically deal with the problem&#151;that is, capping expenditure. We have to control annual expenditure by the political parties. No one wants to talk that language, but capping expenditure would provide for the far more efficient use of resource by political parties. To be frank, it really is not of any great interest where the money comes from so long as it does not exercise undue influence over the political parties concerned. My contributions in this debate will essentially be about capping expenditure. I agree with many of the amendments being moved by the Liberal Democrats but, unfortunately, I feel that this one is of no consequence.</p>

If we were to have this cap, it would have to be accompanied by very tight restrictions to ensure that it happened. However, that is not in the amendment and therefore I do not think that that would happen. The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, mentioned the United States, where there is a cap on donations, but there is no evidence that it has worked. Instead, as someone said to me, it has fuelled a culture of evasion. I know people who have donated more than the capped amount to elections

Therefore, unless there are very tight restrictions which have to be enforced, just including a cap will not work.</p>

It is difficult not to be sympathetic with many perspectives represented this afternoon. This is a very difficult issue to raise but none the less essential, and it is for this reason that we felt that this was a missed opportunity not to have a cap on donations&#151;and a cap on expenditure. We proposed a reduction in expenditure from &#163;20 million to &#163;15 million; we were very supportive of that proposal, and we remain supportive of it. However, there has to be equality in a political system; everybody has to abide by the same rules.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000107"></a>I have sympathy for the position in which the Labour Party finds itself. I have sympathy, for example, with the position that Tony Blair doubtless took in initiating this whole process to try to free himself from the binds and obligations to the trade unions. In 2006, when this process began, Labour&#146;s donation income from the trade unions amounted to &#163;9 million. On top of that, the unions provided &#163;8 million a year of affiliation fees to the Labour Party. Further funding is provided by the trade unions under the radar to local associations through constituency development plans. In fact, trade union literature stated that the unions made huge donations nationally in excess of 2001, and to regional Labour parties. Union offices were given over as phone banks to local constituencies; union members acted as leafleters, canvassers, endorsers and drivers in local campaigns, sending 6 million direct mails&#151;1.8 million in key seats&#151;16,000 postal votes, 188 key co-ordinators and so on.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000108"></a>One understands the links, which are to be respected, with the history of the Labour Party, and the feeling that those links with the trade unions can be distanced with regard to raising funds and accepted when it comes to spending funds. In that regard, some fears are perhaps unjustified. Sir Hayden Phillips himself mentioned that a limit on donations may not challenge the Labour Party&#146;s constitutional relationship with the trade unions. That would be something we would support.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000109"></a>It is to that extent that we see deficiencies in the amendments that have been proposed today, despite the case argued for them by the noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Rennard. They do not go far enough, and the detail of the difficulties that we have with them is contained in Amendment 109&#151;particularly in the conditions listed in subsections (2)(d) and (3)(a) of the amendment. Subsection (2)(d) says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000425"></a>&#147;consent has been obtained either of all the members ... or ... the relevant proportion&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000299"></a>However, subsection (3) defines consent as being when a,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000426"></a>&#147;member was afforded during the 12 months ... a reasonable opportunity to be exempted&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000300"></a>In many ways, the amendment contains an opt-out clause. We would be very much in favour one that allowed for opting in. People should be able to opt in; we very much support that. Mention was made by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, of my friend Andrew Tyrie who, in another place said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000377"></a>&#147;I want to allude to the Hayden Phillips negotiations, which centred on the treatment of affiliation fees. Throughout that period, the Conservative position was absolutely clear, as it still is.

I mean &#147;special&#148; treatment, because logically a &#163;50,000 cap should be accompanied by a complete restriction, meaning that only direct payments by individuals should be permitted as a legitimate source of funding for political parties&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000301"></a>And then he made a moot point, which was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000378"></a>&#147;That, no doubt, accounts for the absurdity that, when polled, a majority of affiliated trade union members turn out to vote for political parties other than Labour.

I was referring to the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, who had made a fair point about trade union members being aware of a political fund and occasionally being asked whether they were supportive of it. It would seem to us to be simple to go one step further and ask, &#147;Who do you think the funds ought to be allocated to?&#148;. That might be stretching it a little far, but in the overall remit, that is our objective. People who hold a set of political beliefs may not have the opportunity to opt out of having their funds taken and given to party-political purposes that they would not support. Our difficulty with Amendment 109 relates to the qualifications that it contains.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000112"></a>My noble friend Lord Marland, together with David Cameron and Francis Maude, played a key role in moving the Conservative Party into a modern era where big-money politics is not accepted. My noble friend has led the Conservative Party on a kind of road-to-Damascus experience, and we hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, or even the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, might lead the Labour Party on the same road. It will then reach the conclusion that such disproportionate funding from one particular source is inappropriate in building public confidence and trust in our political system.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000117"></a>This group of amendments relates to the establishment of a cap on political donations and the treatment of contributions from trade union political funds under such a system. Amendment 108 would place a &#163;50,000 limit on the amount a single donor, whether an individual or an organisation, could donate to a registered political party in any calendar year. A party would be required to refuse donations exceeding this value, and return the excess to the original donor or a person acting on their behalf.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000118"></a>The idea of capping donations has been considered and debated many times in recent years. To give a potted history, the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, who I am delighted to see in his place, considered the merits or otherwise of a cap in the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#146;s landmark 1998 report on the funding of political parties. His recommendation was that a cap should not be introduced. Rather, he proposed measures to introduce full transparency as to the source of all donations above certain specified levels.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000119"></a>Donation caps were again considered by the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee on party funding in 2006 and, of course, by Sir Hayden Phillips in his 2007 review. Both of those reports recommended that a cap on donations should be introduced. However&#151;and this point must be emphasised&#151;both were equally clear that such a cap would result in a loss of income for the largest parties. Both reports therefore concluded that the quid pro quo for a cap on donations was an increase in state funding. The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000427"></a>&#147;a limit should only be considered within the broader context of a discussion about alternative sources of funding, including state funding, for political parties&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000303"></a>Sir Hayden Phillips said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000379"></a>&#147;While parties will still, of course, continue to receive donation income, it will necessarily be significantly reduced, and we should all recognise that this may put them in an unsustainable financial position unless public funding is increased&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC193"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000120"></a>We must be absolutely clear from the start that these two points&#151;a cap on donations and state funding&#151;are inextricably linked. Calculations made in our June 2008 White Paper, <I>Party Finance and Expenditure in the United Kingdom</I>, indicated that a donation cap of &#163;50,000 would produce a shortfall of &#163;5 million to &#163;6 million each year for the two largest parties compared with the level of donations that these parties may be expected to receive if there were no restrictions. Increased public funding would be needed to make up for this shortfall.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000121"></a>Following the publication of Sir Hayden&#146;s report, the parties came together to discuss his recommendations, including those on donation caps and state funding. Regrettably, those talks broke down without cross-party agreement being reached. The Bill before us today does not, therefore, seek to introduce the fundamental package of reforms that Sir Hayden proposed. Rather, it seeks to make changes in those areas where a consensus for change does exist. Making changes to the legislation on party funding without consensus would be hugely destabilising. We cannot allow ourselves to reach a point where the party in power, whoever that may be, feels free to legislate on funding issues to its own advantage with disregard for the views, structure and histories of other parties. I hope that that proposition would receive general support in the Committee.</p>

The proposition does not have widespread support because the Official Opposition have not agreed that it is the way forward. Indeed, it is distinctly possible that they may at some stage in the future take a partisan position on some matter relating to political funding which might be damaging to another party. So why are preoccupied with consensus? I agree entirely with what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said about consensus: we are being led astray by it.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000124"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09050556000492"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I know my noble friend&#146;s view on this. We do not feel it right to legislate unless there is broad consensus. I very much hope that the Opposition feel the same way&#151;we cannot guarantee how they feel; we do not know what they may or may not do if they ever come back into government. I would hope that they might take into account the example of how we are legislating when they decide what to do. The effects of not doing so would be disastrous, because if you legislate just for your own good and your own benefit, it can be extremely counterproductive. But we shall have to see; I take my noble friend&#146;s point.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000125"></a>It remains our view that it is above all transparency which is required in the financing of our political parties. That point came up in debate: both my noble friends Lord Campbell-Savours and Lady Gould made it in passing. A cap on donations could, paradoxically, have the effect of decreasing transparency, because those who wished to make larger donations could seek to evade the restrictions imposed by a donations cap&#151;my noble friend said via foreign donations; I say perhaps  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC194"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by seeking to divert donations through friends and family members. There would need to be detailed and complex provision to address the potential for such abuse. The incentive to such abuse is reduced where no cap exists. We have to take that into account.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000126"></a>In any case&#151;here, I agree with my noble friend Lady Gould&#151;we do not consider that a consensus exists, either between the parties or on the part of the public, on the introduction of donation caps and associated increases in state funding. Identical proposals to those before us today were put forward by the colleague of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, in the other place and were debated at length. The amendment was not supported by either the Government or the Official Opposition and was comprehensively defeated. This shows to some extent that the parties cannot agree on the need for a cap on donations.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, generously paid tribute the honourable Mr Andrew Tyrie, who is a leading Conservative Member of Parliament and an expert on these occasions. I hope that it would not in any way be offensive of me to remind the Committee that Mr Tyrie did not vote for the amendment; indeed, his own Front Bench voted against it, which may be the reason that he did not vote for it.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000128"></a>So we do not think that there is consensus. But what of the public? We have talked about political consensus, but not public consensus. Perhaps I may look to what my right honourable friend the Justice Secretary said in the debate in the other place&#151;I do not do it too often. His comments were echoed in different language by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, at Second Reading. In these times of economic difficulty, it cannot be right to suggest that even more taxpayers&#146; money should go to politicians and political parties. My right honourable friend said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000380"></a>&#147;It would have been difficult to introduce [state funding] in 2007, but in the midst of the worst recession we have seen since the war and when there is great demand on public finances and will be for some years to come, we would need to take leave of our senses to propose that hard-earned taxpayers&#146; money should be used to support our political parties. If we wanted to make one decision that would ensure that the esteem in which we are held&#151;which is not that high anyway&#151;rocketed through the floor, it would be to introduce extensive state funding&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 2/3/09; col. 628.]</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000129"></a>That seems to be quite a hard but pretty accurate representation of where we are in the argument at present. It is for those reasons that we are not minded to support the introduction of a cap on donations today, as proposed by Amendment 108, although we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, for introducing the debate.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000130"></a>Amendment 109 is consequential on Amendment 108, so without one being agreed, the other is impossible as there is a link between them. As the noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Rennard, said, they broadly reflect the proposals put forward by Sir Hayden in his draft agreement, published in October 2007, which would create a clear link between the amount paid in individual contributions to a union&#146;s political fund by way of affiliation fees and the amount of subsequent donation made by the union. Any donation made by a union would be subject to the donation cap that Amendment 108 would impose unless certain conditions are met.

In addition, the affiliates have agreed that full affiliation of the levy-paying membership is the most transparent form of political membership, and moves will be made to that end&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 20/10/08; col. 120]</ul>
<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000132"></a>It will come as no surprise that we are not minded to accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000133"></a>Amendment 143 states that the cap on donations would be commenced on Royal Assent. I need not debate that further, as the nub of the debate is Amendment 108. In passing, I have to say that trade unions are well regulated. Companies making political donations are obliged to do something rather different from what trade unions have to do. No individual shareholder has the right to opt in or opt out of a donation that a company may give. Companies can give donations of very large amounts of money if they so choose. It is slightly unfair that trade union members are obliged to do what they do while company shareholders are not.</p>

I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson&#151;who, I am sorry to see, is not in his place in the Committee today&#151;who referred to the arms race that has developed. I take the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, about spending. I have never been directly involved in the advertising industry but I used to be involved in what you could broadly call the communications industry. I remember speaking to a very astute operator in advertising who, when looking at a poster for the SDP&#151;and this dates me&#151;said, &#147;Good heavens, they are spending an awful lot of money&#148; because there was a row of vintage claret on the poster. I cannot remember what the slogan was but, in tiny type at the bottom, it said, &#147;Vote Conservative&#148;. However, she interpreted the poster as advertising what you would get if you voted SDP.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000141"></a>The waste&#151;I say this with my noble friend Lord Rennard beside me&#151;on advertising in elections is notorious in the industry. I entirely agree with the professional view of the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, that the arms race is benefiting only those who manage to receive money for that purpose rather than the public at large or, indeed, the political parties.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000142"></a>A number of noble Lords have said that the advice from various sources on limiting donations was in the context of more favourable economic times when the public might accept greater public funding. I understand that point of view. However, that is not the only option because, as we will see when we come to Amendment 120A in the names of my noble friend Lord Goodhart and the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, there are other possibilities, such as tax concessions comparable to those provided for contributions to charity. So it is not the only way to take up the shortfall, although, frankly, there is not a huge shortfall. A large proportion of the sums that have been referred to in the Committee today are wasted in the arms race. Getting better value for money rather than more money may well be a good objective for all three major political parties.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000143"></a>I remind the Committee that there is considerable public funding already, as my noble friend Lord Rennard said. We have the Short money for the opposition parties in the House of Commons; the Cranborne money for the opposition parties and the Cross-Benchers in this House; the Policy Development Fund, which could now well be uprated in the light of the needs of the parties and the public to understand what is going on; and there is also considerable public money pouring into the coffers of the Conservative Party in both Houses of Parliament by way of salaries and expenses. So none of us can be against public funding, but we have to make sure that it is properly targeted.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000144"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09050556000500"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I hope the noble Lord was not making the point that that sum from salaries and allowances was purely for Conservative Members.</p>

That particular fund, which I think is now in the region of several million per Parliament, goes to certain named individuals: the Leader of the Opposition and one or two other Conservative Members in the House of Commons, and the Leader of the Conservative Opposition in the House of Lords. None goes to the other opposition parties in that category. When I last looked, the Conservative Party was receiving something in the region of &#163;20 million per Parliament from state funding, and a lot of it does not go to any other political party. So none of us can be against public funding in principle. We may wish to reallocate it, but that is a different matter.</p>
<h5><a name="09050556000441"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000146"></a>I also wanted to take up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould. I am advised that our Amendment 108 would not affect any donation from those sorts of sources, but only those sources outwith the parliamentary and government system. I should also take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Marland, about MPs&#146; communications allowances. We are coming to Amendment 120, and a valid point has been made by a number of commentators and parliamentarians that there is support for an incumbency which is not open to those who are not incumbents. Although my colleagues at the other end of the building no doubt feel the ties of incumbency, I have no such ties; I am entirely open to the suggestion that those who are not incumbents should legitimately recognise that that allowance should be taken into account as part of the expenditure that can be used towards campaigning. I know that it has been said that targeting for some candidates in some marginal seats is to compensate for that, and it would be only fair if those who are to provide that sort of support for challengers should supply it to all challengers in all marginal seats, be they Liberal Democrats, nationalists or Conservatives, if that is to be the logic for providing that support.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000147"></a>I turn to the issue of evasion, to which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, and the Minister referred. This is a bit of a red herring. Frankly, if it is to be possible to police whence a donation of &#163;7,500 is to come, whereby it has to be certified as the amount that that person is contributing and that it is not coming from anyone else, surely it will be much easier to police those who are making much larger contributions. There will be less of them, they will be easier to monitor, and it should be much easier to ensure that the recipient makes a very careful check on where that &#163;50,000 is to come from. The evasion issue mentioned by the noble Lords is not persuasive, but I very much welcome what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said about expenditure. We will come to that later, and I very much look forward to his contribution on that issue.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000148"></a>As regards the unions, Ministers and Members on the Back Benches on the government side of your Lordships&#146; House should think very carefully&#151;even more so in the other place&#151;about what could happen if there were a change of Government. I know that they do not like to think about that, but occasionally it is quite useful to imagine circumstances in which the position is not quite as benign as perhaps it is at present as regards the link between the Labour Party and the unions. In the debate in the other place, my honourable friend Mr David Howarth said:</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC198"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000381"></a>&#147;The final thing I say to the Government is simply this: if they refuse to move on the issue of donation caps now, and if they ignore the view in society at large and in other parts of the political system that this is something that must be done, they will put their own party at risk because when reform does come&#151;as it must&#151;it will come at a time far less favourable to it. The relationship between the Labour party and the trade unions, which we discussed, it is at the heart of that very point. I and my party have offered a very moderate solution to that problem&#151;one with which the Labour party could easily live, and one which the public would recognise as fair&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 2/3/09; col. 638.]</p>

<p><a name="09050556000304"></a>Basing what we have suggested on Sir Hayden Phillips&#146;s proposals is a moderate, sensible base for agreement.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000149"></a>I listened with interest to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, who spoke about opting into the political fund. If the Conservatives win an election&#151;it could happen; funnier things have happened at sea&#151;they could decide to act on this issue. From the tone of his contribution, the noble Lord, Lord Bates, spelt out clearly that if the Conservatives won, they would not seek consensus across the parties in the way that we are, and they would seek to sever the current relationship between the Labour Party and the trade unions.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000150"></a>I say seriously to the Government that I hope that they will think a little more about this issue between now and Report. We will, because we have listened carefully. I am reminded again&#151;I paraphrase because I do not know the original Latin&#151;that St Augustine said, &#147;Make me virtuous, but not yet&#148;. That would seem to be the attitude of the other parties. Frankly, we cannot wait much longer to be virtuous, because the public expect better of us. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

My right honourable friend the Minister of State indicated that we agreed with the principle behind these amendments, and committed to bringing forward government amendments to give effect to it. Our Amendment 112 meets this commitment. In effect, it compels the Secretary of State, at least once in the life of a Parliament lasting more than two years, to review and, if he considers it appropriate, vary the recordable and reportable thresholds in the 2000 Act to take account of changes in the value of money.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000152"></a>Such a review will not take place in the life of the current Parliament, but must be conducted for all future Parliaments which sit for at least two years. In carrying out the review, the Secretary of State will be expected to take account of changes in the value of money as well as the administrative burden on parties. Should he conclude that no change should be made to the thresholds, he will make a Statement to Parliament explaining his reasoning. In the event that the thresholds are amended, we expect that the GDP deflator will be used to calculate any revisions.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000153"></a>The imposition of this obligation to consider changing the thresholds once per Parliament does not limit the existing discretion under Section 155(2)(a) to make such changes as are thought necessary from time to time. So, if the Secretary of State decides that more than one change to the various limits is justified during the life of a Parliament, nothing in these amendments will prevent that. I beg to move.</p>

In 1989, when it was clear that things needed to be done and that they should be carried through by consensus before the Summer Recess, Douglas Hurd, now my noble friend Lord Hurd, who was Home Secretary, delegated to me in my capacity as chairman of the Conservative Party the task of negotiating with the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, who had been appointed by Roy Hattersley&#151;now the noble Lord, Lord Hattersley&#151;the shadow Home Secretary, to deal with the matter. We dealt with it with extreme dispatch. We changed the limits for expenses in by- elections, as agents of all parties were being threatened with prison by virtue of excessive expenditure, and we had no difficulty at all in reaching agreement.

Had they been introduced previously, they would have applied to something like only two of the past 12 Parliaments. The Bill proposes to control expenditure in a way that I think all parties accept needs to be done but to do so purely in the 55-month period after a Parliament has begun. It would seem to be a much more sensible system, and one that should attract consensus, if there needed to be limits in every year and not just in the last few months of the occasional Parliament, which will go the full five years.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000164"></a>I will briefly outline the scheme&#146;s basis. All registered parties will be subject to the spending controls. In particular, spending controls will then apply to the whole of a Westminster cycle. The maximum limit for a full cycle will comprise a five-year running-costs figure and a general election premium recognising that parties will spend additional sums when there is one.  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC202"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In calculating the limit for Parliaments that run for less than the permitted maximum of 61 months, the running-costs figure will be adjusted by the relevant fraction of 61 months depending upon the actual life of the Parliament. The general election premium will then be added back to calculate the enforceable limit. This is much more in line with the scheme discussed in the Hayden Phillips process than is currently in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000165"></a>A single overall limit will apply to the expenditure of each party, including all its constituent organisations whether national, regional, local or other. The spending controls will cover all of the party&#146;s spending except certain defined categories. A number of parties will have difficulty with a number of issues if spending is capped on, for example, paying the party employees&#146; existing pension fund deficits, which is a problem for a number of parties; or interest on debt or the repayment of debt; or legal expenses, where it would be difficult to say that they should be subject to a spending limit when you do not know what legal battles you may have to fight; and so on.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000166"></a>Expenditure which would be classified as capital expenditure under accounting standards would be depreciated as usual in the party accounts, in accordance with the accounting policies, with an appropriate asset life. Only the depreciation figure would count towards the limit. We suggest in the amendments that the appropriate limit would be &#163;150 million for the full term of the Parliament, including a general election premium of &#163;20 million. These limits should apply to all parties that put forward candidates in at least 90 per cent of the constituencies at the general election at the end of the cycle, and should fall pro rata on parties&#151;here we are thinking particularly of the nationalist parties, but it would apply to all parties on a pro-rata basis, in steps of 10 per cent for parties fielding fewer than 90 per cent, with a floor of 10 per cent of the total limit.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000167"></a>For the agents, who need to know where they stand on these things, the existing controls on candidate spending under the Representation of the People Act will continue but will be tightened. My noble friend Lord Tyler will refer to this, but we must tighten those expenditure regulations during the course of the campaign itself so that, for example, direct mail and apportionment of the cost of phone bank activity targeted at a particular constituency are brought within the reportable limits.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000168"></a>Sir Hayden Phillips suggested in his report that we must do more to curb campaign spending:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000396"></a>&#147;We should limit it through generally accepted, easily understood, and enforceable rules&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000305"></a>I suggest that the proposal in the Bill does not meet that test. The alternative proposal is rather more easily understood and enforceable, as it will apply over the whole length of the Parliament.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000169"></a>Those of us who have perhaps trained as party organisers or agents in the past will know that one of the most frequent election law questions put to us is, &#147;When does the election campaign begin?&#148;. Sometimes that is a campaigning question and sometimes it is an expenditure control question, but my answer is always the same: the election campaign begins the day after  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC203"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC203</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the last one has ended. I suggest that that is actually true. We are now in a period of continuous campaigning. Long gone are the days when things went quiet for political parties, perhaps for several years, after the general election and stepped up immediately before it. Now, all political parties are engaged in activity throughout the year and throughout a Parliament. Sir Hayden Phillips forcefully argued that we need a system throughout the entire Parliament. He said that this would,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000429"></a>&#147;make compliance more straightforward. In the current situation, parties must limit their spending over a period beginning 365 days before the general election, but do not know the date of the election until a few weeks beforehand. This oddity gives rise to great complexity in the regulations and distorts patterns of party expenditure&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000306"></a>I know from my own experience what a nonsense this is. In 2000 I argued that it was nonsense to say you would limit expenditure only for 12 months before the general election.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000170"></a>If we in this place and another place accepted the sensible proposal that there be fixed-term Parliaments, it would be viable to say that expenditure should be controlled for the 12 months before polling day. But having to run a rolling operation and not knowing when polling day is, and to be limited in your expenditure knowing that polling day might be 12, 24 or 36 months away, is a nonsense in the present legislation. If the current proposals in the Bill are passed and we have controls only after the 55th month of the Parliament, I suggest that in a very short period of time we will recognise again that that is nonsense.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000171"></a>The amendments allow for variation of spending limits, which is appropriate and sensible, and we can review them in due course through the affirmative procedure. It is also important to recognise that this ideally is what we should have done immediately after the previous general election campaign. We have to have arrangements to cover transitional arrangements, and they are set out in Amendment 144. The amendment provides that for the period between the Bill receiving Royal Assent and polling day in the general election&#151;which, of course, will happen by May next year&#151;parties can spend no more than 75 per cent of the sum specified in the amendment of the national spending limit&#151;that is, 75 per cent of &#163;20 million. That would be a much more workable and practical proposition than is currently set out in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000172"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09050556000513"></a>Lord Henley:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, will not be surprised when I say that we cannot offer him much comfort or support for these amendments. However, Amendment 144, dealing with the communications allowance, might deserve some sympathy. What he is proposing in this group of amendments would impose massive bureaucracy and would do much to discourage a great deal of voluntary activism, which would be a bad thing for politics generally. It could also discourage a great many MPs and councillors from doing quite a lot of the vital work they need to do in communicating with their constituents. It also provides a piecemeal solution to the problem rather than a proper package of reforms. We therefore will not be offering our support to the noble Lord for this amendment or the amendments grouped with it.</p>

I have been saying this since the 1980s, when I was trying unsuccessfully to persuade the Government of that day that we should consider fixed-term Parliaments.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000174"></a>I still have great problems with the Government&#146;s position as it is in the Bill. I am still not happy that it is the answer to the question. The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, put the question of when does an election start; I have said for years and years, of course, that it starts the day after a general election. A question more often put was, &#147;When does the candidate start to promote himself or herself as a candidate and how does that fit into election expenses?&#148; That, for me, has always been the big question. I am not certain that what we have&#151;I will read it again after what the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, said&#151;is the answer to that question. After looking at the amendment, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that it would create an enormous amount of bureaucracy and that is not a satisfactory solution.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000175"></a>This is another of those dilemmas. The Electoral Commission came up some time ago with the idea of having election expenses starting four months before an election, but dropped it because it did not know what four months meant in terms of an election. That proposal was dropped and the solutions that we came up with in the 2000 Act are a part of the problem that we are facing now. Possibly because of my experience, I am one of the people who felt that the triggering mechanism that we had before 2000 worked quite well. It was a shame that the 2000 Act stopped that. Clearly, once one starts to promote a candidate, one has started to promote expenditure. I could see nothing simpler and easier than that, so I do not understand why the Commons was so resistant to the proposals to reintroduce the triggering mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000176"></a>It is with regret that I have to say to my noble friend that I still have a problem with the Bill. It needs a lot more thought and discussion, and I should like a lot more explanation. I said on Second Reading that I hoped that somebody would write it all out for me in words of one syllable so that I could look at each stage to see what it meant. I am not at all sure that we have the answer at the moment. We are stuck with what we have in front of us for perhaps the next general election, but what will happen after that? We do not have the answers to that. I am still not sure, and before we reach Report I will have to do a lot more thinking and work on the Bill, which I most certainly will do.</p>

I completely agree with the thrust of the amendments. The problem is that some constituencies are spending huge amounts of money and there has to be some control. I do not know whether that limit should be &#163;50,000, although it is good enough for the moment. While the Government may reject the amendment today, I hope that they might consider matters further before Report. I completely support the principle.</p>

I should say that the advice that I am about to read into our proceedings does not come from my wife, but from another, who is a retired agent. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000397"></a>&#147;The proposal to pre-candidacy election expenses for certain elections gives me more concern. The whole idea of permitted expenditure for a person before they are declared, let alone nominated as a candidate is anathema to me. The new Section 76ZA in my view makes a total nonsense of election expense restrictions. In my day the art of an election agent was to get your candidate elected within the then permitted maximum expenditure allowed. Now it is extremely difficult to distinguish when a person becomes a candidate and almost impossible to ensure a level playing field for candidates at an election. In my view the whole section will be a nightmare to deal with especially (3) and particularly when you read at the end of first section of 76ZA the omission of part of 90ZA of the Representation of the People Act 1983&#148;.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000179"></a>I do not know precisely the misgivings of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, but clearly they are shared with Conservative agents on the other side of the political divide.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000180"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09050556000517"></a>Lord Marland:</b> I am sympathetic to the thrust of the amendments, which have been thoughtfully put together. I am at slight loggerheads with my party, whereas I totally agree that the amendments would be very difficult to impose and would give us greater policing difficulty.

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000181"></a>The particular point that I may be at loggerheads with my party on is the back-counting of 365 days for adding up the total election expenditure. At the last election, great strain was put on parties, considering that in that back-counting you had to include the cost of the European elections and the local elections. The decision as to when the election is called and the back-counting totally favours the incumbent, and this cannot be fair in the current electoral system. Another system of establishing the period during which the total spending limit for an election is allowed has to be rethought. Some of the amendments have a stab at that, and I hope that the Minister might consider looking at this issue again during this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000183"></a>This group of amendments seeks to effect a profound shift in the regulation of political spending. They would replace the current system which regulates what parties can spend for election purposes in the 365 days prior to the date of election and, separately, what  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC206"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>candidates can spend for election purposes in the period between the dissolution of Parliament and the date of election, although noble Lords will be aware that the Bill makes changes to the regulation of candidates&#146; expenditure.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000184"></a>The amendments appear to be based on the recommendations put to the parties by Sir Hayden Phillips in 2007, although they differ in several key respects from his proposals. We have previously stated our broad support for the comprehensive package of measures proposed by Sir Hayden, including his recommendations on the control of political expenditure. However, I must inform noble Lords that we are not minded to accept the proposed amendments.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000185"></a>Many concerns and questions remain about how a system of all-encompassing spending limits such as those Sir Hayden proposed could work in practice. The amendments bring a number of these concerns into sharp focus. Upon close consideration, the proposed new clauses would, if enacted, have a number of unintended and undesirable consequences.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000186"></a>Amendment 115 would introduce an all-encompassing annual limit of &#163;20 million on the amount that a political party can spend during each 12-month period after a general election. This differs markedly from Sir Hayden&#146;s proposals. He recommended a whole-of-parliament spending limit of &#163;150 million, with an additional general-election premium of &#163;20 million. No such top up is provided for in Amendment 115. The amendments appear to be intended to apply to the majority of spending by a party for electoral and non-electoral purposes. As a result, we are concerned that parties would face great difficulty in meeting running and campaigning costs in the year of a general election.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000187"></a>Amendment 116 proposes that the level of the annual limit should be reduced for smaller parties, which it defines as those who contested fewer than 100 seats at the previous general election. Again, this differs markedly from Sir Hayden&#146;s proposals that the whole-of-parliament spending limit for smaller parties should be pro-rated only according to the number of seats being contested at the forthcoming election. Under this amendment, the spending limit for smaller parties would be calculated through use of a formula taking into account the number of seats previously contested, the number of seats to be contested at the next general election and the number of months between elections. It is not clear how a smaller party can be expected to know, potentially years in advance, how many seats it intends to contest at the next election and how many months away that election is. We are therefore concerned that smaller parties would face great difficulty in calculating their annual spending limits.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000188"></a>We believe that the proposals in this amendment could disadvantage newer parties by taking into account seats contested at the previous election. There is also a risk that a party could field candidates in a high number of seats at one election to earn the full &#163;20 million spending limit in the following years. It could then choose to contest only a small number of target seats, yet would be permitted to spend very large sums of money in doing so.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000189"></a>Amendment 114 seeks to impose a local pre-candidacy limit of &#163;50,000 in any year, although it would regulate spending by a party, not an individual who goes on to become a candidate. The amendment goes on to state that, after the dissolution of Parliament, the existing candidate spending limit set out in the Representation of the People Act would then apply.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000190"></a>There is perhaps some confusion on this point and it may be helpful if I set out clearly how the current legislation works. The distinction between spending by or on behalf of a party and spending by or on behalf of a candidate is crucial. Current legislation regulates these types of spending separately, and we are concerned at any measures that would blur or confuse that distinction.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000191"></a>The candidate spending limit is often referred to somewhat misleadingly as the &#147;local spending limit&#148;. That implies that it is intended to regulate all spending which takes place within a given constituency. This is not the case, however. It regulates only spending which is by or on behalf of a candidate for the purposes of the candidate&#146;s election. This has been the clear understanding since the famous Tronoh Mines judgment of 1952. Spending on campaigning by a political party, even where that spending is focused on or targeted at a particular constituency or area, should be counted against the separate limit which regulates all party expenditure in the year before a general election. That limit has been in place only since the passage of the 2000 Act. Before that Act, such spending was entirely unregulated, and the period before the regulated 365 days remains unregulated.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000192"></a>It may be the intention of noble Lords to seek to prevent political parties targeting their campaign expenditure at constituencies. If that is the aim, I suggest that the clause should not be labelled as a &#147;pre-candidacy limit&#148;. As it refers only to spending by parties, it does nothing to prevent spending ahead of dissolution by individuals who go on to become candidates, unlike Clause 14.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000193"></a>The focus on more marginal seats is an inevitable consequence of our electoral system. Indeed, in any electoral system it is inevitable that parties will seek to concentrate resources and effort where they feel they have the greatest prospect of electoral success. We do not, in principle, see any reason to seek to prevent that, as it is a legitimate feature of our democratic system.</p>

A very rich man with a vast amount of money could pick out 30 or 40 marginal constituencies, concentrate vast amounts of money&#151;millions and millions of pounds&#151;on those constituencies and thereby influence a general election. That is not a democracy as I understand the term; there is something inherently wrong with a system that allows that. I only ask my noble friend why the Government do not take away this whole area and reconsider it before Report. Later, there will be further amendments that deal specifically with this issue. This is wrong and everyone knows that it is wrong. Labour MPs object to it, so why cannot we stop it now in this Bill?</p>

However, political parties are limited to &#163;20 million spending in the year before an election and, as such, to spend a million pounds in one constituency would be less than wise. Regulation of election expenditure is already complex; any further proposals would introduce further complexity and be difficult and unwieldy to operate in practice. Defining when a central party&#146;s expenditure is regarded as local or national would be particularly difficult. A further problem arises when expenditure could be said to be targeted at voters from a particular constituency but is not used in that constituency. The amendment goes on to state that where boundaries change between elections the commission would have the power to apportion expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000307"></a>subject to issuing guidance. I must advise noble Lords that the commission is the independent regulator of party finance and that this proposal is inappropriate, both in terms of good legislative practice and proper parliamentary scrutiny. The commission can, and does, make recommendations which the Government consider along with representations from other interested bodies, but any changes to electoral legislation are ultimately a matter for the Government of the day and for Parliament to consider. Therefore, a more appropriate mechanism for achieving this would be for the Secretary of State to lay an order, subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, making any such change, having received a recommendation from the commission.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000201"></a>Amendment 117 provides for a power to vary, by order, any of the sums specified in the 1983 Act. This power is presumably conferred on the Secretary of State, although it is not clear from the proposed  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC209"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment. A power to vary, by order, the level of the candidate spending limit already exists in the 1983 Act, but such a power can be exercised only in consequence of changes in the value of money or following a recommendation by the Electoral Commission. We are concerned that the amendment grants a wider power than currently exists.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000202"></a>Amendment 120 would add expenditure paid for out of the House of Commons communications allowance to the list of regulated matters. The rules regarding use of that allowance are a matter for the other place, but I can perhaps make one observation here. As with all parliamentary allowances, the communications allowance must be spent only on matters in connection with carrying out parliamentary duties. It cannot be used for partisan or political purposes. Given these clear conditions, I find it difficult to see how money spent appropriately under the terms of the allowance could be regarded as being for electoral purposes. Notwithstanding this, my honourable friend the Minister of State gave a clear commitment in the other place that a proposal would be brought forward on the appropriate use of allowances during the pre-candidacy regulated period proposed in Clause 14. The other place may consider that some form of restriction is required when the new limit is in operation, but that is not a matter for this Committee to opine on. Furthermore, it is not appropriate for legislation to alter or restrict an allowance established and administered under House rules. Any change to the way in which a parliamentary allowance works should be achieved using the procedures that were used to establish it. We would not want to make provision for legislation to regulate how either House conducts its business.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000203"></a>Amendment 118 and associated Amendments 141 and 144 are concerned with the transitional arrangements that would apply should the proposals contained elsewhere in this group of amendments be agreed to. They provide that only 75 per cent of the proposed annual spending limit would be available for the period beginning 31 July 2009 until the next election. We are concerned that it would be very difficult for the parties to adjust at such short notice to the major changes proposed by the amendments.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000204"></a>Amendments 145 and 146 propose commencing the new clauses contained in Amendments 114 and 115 just 14 days after Royal Assent. Again, we are concerned about the very short notice that this would give parties to prepare for such significant changes. I also note that the commencement of other critical amendments in this group, including on the spending limit for smaller parties and the list of qualifying expenditure, has been left unspecified.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000205"></a>We firmly believe that any changes to the regulation of party funding should be made only where broad agreement can be established between the parties to move forward. This is particularly the case where the changes represent a major shift from the existing arrangements. Following the publication of Sir Hayden&#146;s final report in 2007, the three largest parties came together to negotiate on a way forward. Regrettably, those talks broke down without a consensus being

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000206"></a>The amendments before us make proposals based on Sir Hayden&#146;s recommendations but, as I have set out, they differ in a number of important ways and would create a number of difficulties and problems. I am grateful to the Members of the Committee who tabled these amendments for the opportunity to discuss these matters in some detail. However, it would not be appropriate to make the wide-ranging and unwieldy changes proposed by the amendments without the requisite consensus and at such a late stage of what has always been intended to be a far more modest Bill. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000207"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09050556000525"></a>Lord Rennard:</b> I asked a question about when the campaign begins. It seems clear that, if the Bill is not amended along these lines, the debate on how to deal with this issue will simply begin again the day after polling day following the next general election campaign and we will not have achieved very much with this Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000208"></a>I thank, in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, for his support for these amendments and, if I may say so, for hitting the nail on the head when it comes to the Bill&#146;s failure to deal with fundamental problems. Between 1883 and 2000, effective legislation was in place to deal with some of the problems of using money to buy undue influence in a particular constituency. Inadvertently, the trigger was removed in 2000, and, like the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, I wondered long and hard whether the best way of trying to introduce some level of fair play at the constituency level might be to bring back the trigger. However, after talking to all my colleagues, it would seem that nine years after its abolition, it would be very difficult to bring it back. Therefore, there is a need for alternative mechanisms, which are set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000209"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, for at least agreeing that the code in the proposals is clearly wrong and that we need to do something to try to get things right. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Marland, for his sympathy for the amendments. I thank the Minister and the expert team behind him for suggesting some drafting amendments and improvements to this series of amendments that could produce a much better package than is currently in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000210"></a>The debate around these amendments has focused on two other principles&#151;a balance between bureaucracy and effectiveness. On bureaucracy, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, I should say that I am the only person in the Room who is currently responsible for administering the bureaucracy on the code of rules for a national party organisation. I have to do that every year in which there might be a general election. In which year would I decide not to have the bureaucratic controls in place on the grounds that there was no chance of a general election? It would never be responsible for me not to have the bureaucracy in place because there might always be the possibility of a general election in any year. Therefore, at a national level the bureaucracy is in place on a permanent basis, and that must be the  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC211"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>case in all the major party headquarters. It would be wrong if we did not have that. If we have to have it in place every year in case there is a general election, and we have to track back all our expenditure, which is limited over the 12 months before polling day, we might as well go the whole hog and say that we should have expenditure controls over the life of a Parliament.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000211"></a>The other issue is effectiveness. To deal with this problem, which is clear, readily identifiable and recognised by most people, we need to do something to control party-political expenditure and buying undue influence in the ballot box. It is simply not an effective principle to say that we should have controls between the 51st month after a general election and the 55th month in which it must happen. This is a nonsense in trying to control the overall problem.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000212"></a>I end with a plea to the Minister and those close to him. They are saying, &#147;This is what we are trying to do with this Bill&#148;. I hope that they will look carefully at what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said and perhaps go to Mr Peter Bradley, the former Member for the Wrekin, and say, &#147;This is what we are planning to do. What happened to you in your constituency in the last general election? How can such a clear abuse of the original principles of the 1983 legislation be addressed by this Bill?&#148; I suggest to the Minister and the Government that it will not address those problems in any significant way. We need to look further at this.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000213"></a>However, having suggested that we need to try to refine this package and make it better, I will return  to the debate at a later date. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I was horrified to recollect that the first time I stood in a parliamentary election was in 1966&#151;I was terribly young, of course. In those good old days, as other Members of the Committee may recall, we were dragooned into recognising that the man or woman who was responsible for our expenditure could go to prison if we did not abide by the rules. The amendment about qualifying expenditure seeks to bring up to date those simple principles of candidature, which, as my noble friend said, go back to the 19th century. They were well expressed in Section 75 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, 100 years after the first legislation on this issue, and we refer to that section in our amendment. Section 75(1) reads as follows:</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC213"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000406"></a>&#147;No expenses shall, with a view to promoting or procuring the election of a candidate at an election, be incurred by any person other than the candidate, his election agent and the persons authorised in writing by the election agent on account&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000407"></a>(a) of holding public meetings or organising any public display; or</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000408"></a>(b) of issuing advertisements, circulars or publications; or</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000409"></a>(c) of otherwise presenting to the electors the candidate or his views or the extent or nature of his backing or disparaging another candidate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000215"></a>It all seems very simple, and no doubt it seemed very simple to candidates in the 1980s and even before that, but, as the Minister said in responding to the previous group of amendments, spending by or on behalf of a party has to be distinguished from spending by or on behalf of a candidate, and it is not. That is why we need this group of amendments.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000216"></a>The amendment specifies the type of expenditure that parties can legitimately undertake to fight elections. It is very different from the situation in 1983, let alone in 1966. I particularly draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the proposed subsection (1)(c) in our amendment. It states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000431"></a>&#147;unsolicited material sent to electors, whether or not addressed to them by name (including newsletters or similar publications issued by or on behalf of the party with a view to giving electors in a particular electoral area information about the opinions or activities of, or other personal information relating to, their elected representatives or existing or prospective candidates)&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000308"></a>and then there is the detail of what other costs can be included.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000217"></a>Since the 1983 legislation, and indeed even since the 2000 Act, there has been a huge increase in the amount of unsolicited mail sent to individual electors by name which, if it did not specifically ask the elector to support Mr A or Miss B, has been ruled as not being part of the necessary expenditure limits in that constituency. That is extraordinary. Now it would be seen to be very much part of the political weaponry of all the parties, yet it is clearly intended deliberately to get round the rules that have been in place for 100 years and more. Those of us who have stood in elections&#151;not necessarily as far back as 1966 but more recently&#151;will be only too conscious of how this trend has hugely increased and developed in recent years.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000218"></a>Therefore, our amendment seeks to define all qualifying expenditure, including all party-political spending, whether it be from central headquarters funds, designed to influence a particular constituency, or whether it is intended for wider dissemination. This would apply regardless of whether such spending was promoted by a particular candidate or whether it was based on a decision taken at a national level for other reasons. Again, I make it clear, as we have done frequently in the Committee, that this amendment, together with other of our amendments, is intended to close the loophole by which parties nationally can go outside the limits imposed locally and not take any notice of what is happening in local campaigning, or take notice of the responsibility that the candidate or his or her agent has in terms of the controls that have been in place all that time.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000219"></a>Frankly, the strict limits on candidates are no longer relevant&#151;they do not work&#151;while this expenditure is considered to be not subject to any sort of limitation. As I have already said, subsection (1)(c) of our proposed new clause is intended to catch all the publications sent to specific constituencies which are paid for from national expenditure. It should clearly be read in conjunction with the new clauses to which we have already referred concerning the local pre-candidacy spending limit and the national spending limit. It is intended to ensure that the entirely proper controls that have been in place for so long are effective.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000220"></a>I also draw attention to subsection (3) of the proposed new clause, under which expenditure on, for example, parliamentary staff should not be included in such calculations for qualifying expenditure, but the expenditure on a campaign manager should clearly be included. This is intended to ensure that expenditure that allows an elected MP to do his or her job as a parliamentarian is quite distinct from expenditure on his or her campaign to be re-elected. We believe that this is a much more workable and relevant assessment of what should and should not be categorised as expenditure in this context. It effectively brings up to date the very limited list from the Representation of the People Act 1983 and, in so doing, we believe that it is much more in the spirit of the controls that have been in place for a century and more to stop people buying parliamentary seats. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000221"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09050556000528"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> One problem for me in this whole business has been the fact that I have spent the past eight years in this House steering very clear of political argument. That may seem strange because when I was in the Commons I was probably a bit of a beast on the Back Benches. But here I have been very careful to avoid getting into party-political point-scoring in debates on the Floor of the House or even in Committee. One of my difficulties with this Bill is that we are just led into that kind of political argument. In the context of what has happened, it is very hard to avoid getting into a party-political debate, and I apologise to the Committee. As I said, I have spent eight years avoiding it in every contribution that I have made.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000222"></a>I want to produce a letter that was sent out by the Cities of London and Westminster Conservative Association because in many ways it represents the debate that we are having now. I wonder whether it fits into the legislation and whether this kind of material should be subject to some kind of control. In constituencies throughout the country, we see letters from David Cameron that have been sent out nationally and which somehow seem to get round all kinds of constraints, whether it is before or during campaigns. This letter was sent to my mother who lives in Whitehall Court, which noble Lords will know is just opposite Downing Street. The letter is headed, &#147;Conservative Fighting Fund Appeal&#148;. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000410"></a>&#147;Dear Mrs Campbell-Savours,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000411"></a>No one can tell when the call to battle for the Conservative Party will come, to respond to the dreadful state into which Gordon Brown has led our country&#151;and without a word of apology for his own part in causing the disaster through his chosen economic and financial policies.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000412"></a>The Conservative Party will need money to meet whatever further contingencies and challenges arise, and this letter is to appeal to you to put your hand in your pocket now&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09050556000309"></a>we all know what is coming as many of us have probably sent them out&#151;and the letter is signed by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, who is here today. He might not know that it has gone out. My argument is not with him but about whether this kind of material should be sent out. It includes a request to send your money to:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000413"></a>&#147;The Rt. Hon. the Lord Brooke ... London SW1&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09050556000310"></a>and is followed by the words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000414"></a>&#147;I/We have pleasure in enclosing ... my/our contribution to the Conservative Fighting Fund&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000311"></a>A postal vote application is also enclosed with the letter.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000223"></a>The document was sent last week in the middle of a campaign for the European elections. Nothing indicates that it would fall under any of the constraints that we have discussed today. I am pretty sure that it has not. If there is confusion in the Conservative Party about whether it is within campaign territory, it applies equally in the Labour Party. A colleague sought information somewhere in the United Kingdom of a regional office and got a number of different interpretations as to what the law is. It does not apply only to the Conservatives; it probably applies to a number of political parties. If the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, is in control of the Liberal Democrats, he is probably keeping tight control over how these things do in the light of the Michael Brown affair.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000224"></a>It is difficult to understand how that material can go out at this stage. I did not read the whole letter but it is basically an election leaflet. It is asking people for money and encloses a postal vote application form. Within a matter of weeks we will be going to the polls in London. Somewhere along the line it should be included in election expenditure, but it does not because it does not refer to a candidate. That is how it gets out of it. If we were to slip the name of the candidate into the letter, I do not think that it would make much difference. The reality is that it is an election document.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000234"></a>Amendment 119 lists the types of expenditure which would be regulated by the spending limits proposed in the earlier Amendments 114, 115 and 116. Sir Hayden Phillips&#146;s proposals sought to regulate the vast majority of a party&#146;s spending with only a few key exceptions, such as interest on debt, legal expenses and intra-party transfers. Amendment 119 instead mirrors the list-based approach taken in current legislation. It largely replicates the list of regulated matters for the existing campaign spending limit, which is set out in Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act. However, the amendment makes several key  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC217"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>changes and additions to that list and I shall speak to only a couple of these. Expenditure would appear to qualify whether or not it is,</p>
<ul><a name="09050556000433"></a>&#147;for the purposes of the candidate&#146;s election&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09050556000312"></a>This is a very significant change.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000235"></a>Specifically, expenditure on the remuneration or allowances of staff would be included, provided that those staff work in any way on matters listed elsewhere as qualifying expenditure, although I note the amendment makes no attempt to define who would count as staff. Staff costs are currently specifically excluded from the list of regulated matters in Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act. This is because when that Act was being discussed all parties recognised the difficulties that staff would have in accurately assessing which part of their work can be said to be on campaign issues and which can be said to be on non-campaign duties. That is particularly so where a member of staff works in part on campaign matters and in part on non-campaign matters. Even if staff were able to do so, verification by the Electoral Commission would likely prove very difficult without it proving unduly burdensome for parties&#151;for example, by the keeping of timesheets or something similar. Without that sort of record keeping there would be significant scope for parties to avoid the rules. For example, rules might be circumvented by changing job titles. All of these problems would come to the fore should the noble Lord&#146;s proposed system come into force.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000236"></a>Secondly, any expenditure of more than &#163;100 per year by any person on qualifying expenditure which is intended to benefit a registered party would count against that party&#146;s limit. It would not, apparently, be necessary for the party to have authorised that expenditure. This is not appropriate. Where a party authorises expenditure, it should count against the limit. Where a party does not authorise expenditure, it should be regulated separately by the controls that already exist on third-party expenditure.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000237"></a>We have suggested previously that we are open to considering whether the list of regulated matters in Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act needs amendment. We are, as on many other areas of the Bill and associated policy, open to views on this. However, the amendment goes much further than is desirable. It proposes unworkable and undesirable amendments to the schedule. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is of course quoting just one of a huge number of examples. All parties are as confused as he and I, particularly by this issue of unsolicited mail. It has grown exponentially in recent years. Unless we are prepared to take it in, as the Minister now appears to be saying that he might be able to do with the schedule to the 2000 Act, this will continue to be a vast loophole. In all three major parties, even those responsible for local campaigns in marginal seats quite resent this sort of interference and intervention by party headquarters. It is often peddling a line or spinning a tale which is not much in accord with the local candidate&#146;s campaign. It undermines that relationship between the candidate and his or her electorate in his or her constituency in a way that is

Unsolicited mail&#151;indeed, unsolicited e-mail, now&#151;is undoing literally a century and a half of careful pinning of accountability and identification of responsibility for who is going to pay for an election.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000239"></a>The Minister referred to two ways in which our amendments would change the current situation. Neither case is as substantial as he suggests. He says that he is open to views. I hope that he has been listening, not least to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. If they were honest, all Members of the Committee would admit that campaigning techniques have moved on in a way which is not thoroughly desirable and is certainly not covered by legislation.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000240"></a>It is therefore extremely important that we identify these things with greater clarity by some means or other. That may be achieved not in the Bill but in secondary legislation. For example, the Minister mentioned that the four months leading up to the European parliamentary elections are a controlled period for the purpose of expenditure. I am not sure that all parties are aware of that given some of the publications to which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has referred. It sounds like, from what the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said, that putting together the package for postal votes clearly relates to an election&#151;I exonerate the noble Lord from doing anything improper&#151;because you do not do that in March simply for the fun of it; you do it because you know that there is an election coming up.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000241"></a>I am hopeful that the Minister, in saying that the Government are open to views, is genuinely listening on this. The points that have been made are formidable and we will not get another opportunity to deal with this problem for some years to come if we miss it now. I therefore hope that, if I now withdraw the amendment, the Government will think carefully about how they might address this formidable problem before Report. In the mean time, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This sum is within reach of a moderately well-off party activist, and not just the rich. We believe that it also represents a balance between setting the level so high that it loses its purpose of encouraging parties to seek large numbers of smaller donations or setting it so low that the benefit of tax relief is not worth pursuing&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000313"></a>Most of the recommendations in the committee&#146;s report were accepted and incorporated in the 2000 Act, but not this one. I was a member of the Committee on Standards of Public Life at the time, as was the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, who I am extremely pleased to see has put his name to this amendment.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90505-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000244"></a>All political parties need funding. It is highly undesirable that all funds should come from the Government as used to, and may still be the case in Sweden, since it greatly reduces the need to go out and recruit members and give more contact with the voters. Equally, however, it would be at least as undesirable&#151;or even more so&#151;that party funding should come mainly from a small number of rich donors making very large donations. That would be a travesty of democracy; it would give too much influence to the big donors, both in the setting of the donee party&#146;s policy and in enabling the donee party to run a more effective campaign. It is important to encourage parties to seek small or moderate donations from people who are not in a position to exercise influence over the party but who give money to it because they believe in and support it.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000245"></a>One way of doing this is to give tax relief for small or moderate donations, including membership subscriptions, which enables donors to give a larger sum of money for the same net cost to them as now prevails. This does not involve the payment of any taxpayers&#146; money to political parties out of government funds; rather, it reduces the amount of tax that the donor has to pay to the Government, which I believe is considerably more acceptable to the public than payment out of government funds.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000246"></a>Political parties are an essential part of any democratic system. We recognise that giving to charities should be encouraged by tax relief to the donors. By extending tax relief to donations to political parties, we would recognise that those donations are also very much in the public interest and deserve tax relief. It may not be known by many Members of the Committee, but tax relief has already been extended by the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, previously called Capital Transfer Tax Act 1984 to bequests by will to a political party which won at least two seats at the preceding general election or one seat and a total of no fewer than 150,000 votes.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000247"></a>Tax relief on modest donations is not linked to the question whether there should be a cap on very large donations. If there is such a cap, then increasing the value of smaller donations would be an acceptable way of restoring some of the income lost to the parties. If there was no cap, tax relief would increase the value to the parties of smaller donations and reduce the extent of their dependence on large donations. Both of these seem to be desirable conclusions.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000248"></a>On the question whether tax relief might work, we have the advantage in this country of an established system of tax relief for donors to charities through the  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC220"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gift-aid system. I have no doubt that using a modified form of gift aid is the best way of achieving tax relief on gifts to political parties. It would, as I said, be a modified form. There are two main modifications. First, gift aid applies to gifts of any amount. That is, indeed, the right thing for gifts to charity&#151;the bigger the gifts the better&#151;but it does not apply to donations to political parties because it is an essential purpose of the tax relief on political donations to increase the value of smaller donations as against bigger ones.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000249"></a>As I have mentioned, the Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended that relief should be given on donations of &#163;500 in any one year, or on the first &#163;500 of donations exceeding that total in the  year. As that committee recommended the limit in 1998, I have increased the limit in paragraph 5 of Amendment 132B to &#163;1,000, which may or may not be an appropriate figure. I shall certainly be happy to consider any variations.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000250"></a>The second modification is that tax relief for gift aid extends to higher rate tax so that higher rate taxpayers get refunds of their higher rate tax on the amount of their gift to charity. Again, that is fair enough for gifts to charity, but to apply that rule to donations to political parties would give greater tax relief to donations from higher rate taxpayers than to donations of the same initial amount from a donor who is not paying higher rate tax. Paragraph 6 of the proposed new schedule in Amendment 132B restricts tax relief for any donor to the basic rate of tax.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000251"></a>Another question concerns the parties that should be eligible to receive donations that give rise to tax relief. Gift aid is of course available for donations to any registered charity, but I doubt whether tax relief for any registered political party would be appropriate, at least initially; it may be possible to widen the number later. That could lead to the problem which arose in Germany, where state funding is available to minor parties. One such party was the Grey Party, which campaigned for pensioners. Having received a generous fund from the state, the party used it for building residential homes for their members rather than using it for fighting elections. It is undesirable to give it to a party&#151;even a registered party&#151;which might act in that way.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000252"></a>I put in the test of two seats at the previous general election on the basis of the exemption from inheritance tax. By an oversight, I am afraid, I failed to add the possibility of one member being elected and at least 150,000 votes being cast as an alternative test. There could indeed be further possible tests or different tests to decide which parties are entitled to the benefit of the tax relief.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000253"></a>Tax relief on the lines suggested by these amendments is plainly desirable. It reduces the influence of very rich donors; it encourages parties to seek more members; and it recognises that modest donations are an important part of the democratic process. The part that modest donations can play has been highlighted dramatically by President Obama&#146;s huge success in funding his campaign by myriads of small donations. That should be the target for which we look. I beg to move.</p>

As he indicated, I was a member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life which produced this report on the funding of political parties in the United Kingdom, and he and I were strong advocates of this measure. We persuaded all our colleagues that it was very worthy and it was therefore a recommendation of the full committee. I have not changed my mind since.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000255"></a>The noble Lord has given the main reasons for it and I can be brief in adding to them and, to some extent, repeating them. First, it would reduce the dependence on large donations and, I hope, considerably extend the number of small donors. In the report, we said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000419"></a>&#147;We have found very widespread support for the view that it is more democratic, and therefore in the public interest, that political parties should be funded by a large number of small donations rather than by a small number of large donations. A system of tax relief which increases the value to political parties of smaller donations is likely to encourage the parties to make greater efforts to obtain them&#148;.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000256"></a>Much more important, in my view, is the second reason. To my mind, supporting and participating in the political process is just as important a part of public life as supporting charities, and just as worthy. In this day and age when, sadly, so many people take the view that being involved in the political process is not an honourable activity, recognising it in the tax system would be an important indication that it was worthy. I suspect that most people in this Room share my view that the way in which politicians and the political process are now perceived is most disappointing, and I would hope that the amendment would be a small step towards putting that right. Aligning tax relief would recognise the importance of participating in the process. I cannot do better than quote the noble Lord, Lord Parkinson, who gave evidence to the committee in 1998. When asked for his reaction to a tax incentive scheme, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000420"></a>&#147;I think that is a very attractive idea. I think anything that encourages people to participate in a political process, to get involved in political parties, to broaden the base of their membership is to be welcomed because I think politics is a very honourable profession and supporting a political party is a very worthwhile way of spending one&#146;s time and money&#148;.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that it would not represent a cost to the taxpayer, but does he have any idea? Has anyone tried to cost it at any stage?</p>

<p><a name="09050556000258"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09050556000542"></a>Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market:</b> I was intending to come to that. It would obviously depend on the level of take-up. However, the fact that donations that are eligible for tax relief are limited by size and limited to the basic rate means that the cost would not be very great. However, I will come back to that point in a moment.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000259"></a>I wanted to quote the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, who, in giving evidence to our committee, was also asked what he thought about this. His was not such a

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09050556000421"></a>&#147;I think that as a weapon for the political parties to build up their membership base in particular ... as part of that armoury as long as it was structured in a way that was designed to benefit the small donations, I wouldn&#146;t be against it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000314"></a>In fact, the proposal in the amendment is to limit tax relief in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, described.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000260"></a>It is interesting to note&#151;I certainly did not until I came to look at this matter&#151;that in inheritance tax, relief is given not just in relation to limited donations but for donations of whatever scale. That indicates that the tax system recognises the points that I have been making and it shows that there is a precedent.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000261"></a>My third point, which brings me to the question that I have just been asked, is that there would be a small&#151;I think, fairly small&#151;reduction in tax revenue. The argument in favour of giving a state benefit, as one might describe it, to political parties in this way rather than through direct funding is that it would involve decisions and choices by a lot of citizens around the country. In other words, the allocation and amount of the relief given would depend on choices by citizens who&#151;this is an important point&#151;would have to make a contribution themselves.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000262"></a>I now come to the really difficult point. As a former Chief Secretary, and looking at the current appalling state of the public finances in the debate on the economy on Thursday, I will be arguing that every proposal for tax relief or for further state funding should be looked at extraordinarily carefully and be very well justified. Given the state of the public finances today, I would not put forward such a case.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000263"></a>The Government will no doubt be resistant to this proposal, as they were when our report was published. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, this was the only amendment that the Government refused to accept. Interestingly, they gave no reasons; they just rejected it. I suspect that some of the reasons were that they have the trade union contributions and felt that this proposal would benefit other parties more than themselves.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000264"></a>I hope that the Minister will give reasons other than cost&#151;I accept that argument&#151;and the reasons for the principle being rejected. The principle is what matters, and why I support the amendment. I hope that, in more propitious times, we can address this again in preference to further state funding. It is the right way to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000265"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09050556000543"></a>Baroness Gould of Potternewton:</b> I follow the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, on the question of principle&#151;I hope that my noble friend will support it. There may be some details, such as the maximum amount of &#163;1,000 in the schedule and at what level we should determine whether tax relief is available. However, the principle is, without doubt, absolutely sound. I support the idea, and the concept that we should be thinking much more about small donations to political parties rather than the big donations that all have relied on. It is an important part, not only of increasing party membership, but of building a better democratic base on which our political parties actually work.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000266"></a>We all say that democracy relies on the political parties; it is a nice slogan. Well, the political parties rely on getting people&#146;s support and this is one way of doing it. There may be some details still to be looked at, but the principle is just right.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000267"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09050556000544"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I endorse the amendment, to which I have put my name. I am slightly disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, thinks that this is the right thing to do but not now. We want to get more people involved in our political process now. There is a crisis of confidence, which is partly related to the economic crisis: people do not see the political parties and Parliament as representing them. The case has increased since 10 years ago, when the Committee on Standards in Public Life so strongly put the argument to which the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor spoke. Given that we seem unable to reach another way to help the individual citizen to be more directly involved, and seeing that they are involved&#151;at a modest level in terms of contribution&#151;in the political process, it would be pity to put this into cold storage for &#147;better times&#148;. Better times may not come for some time.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000268"></a>I confess that I was attracted by the idea of the Power commission, chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, that electors could in some way or other indicate which party they thought should receive a limited part of the available state funding when they went to the polling station. Frankly, that is a long way off; we will not be able to get it. This, however, is an intensely practical, simple solution. A huge number of people already adopt a similar provision for charity contributions. I see no reason why taking an active interest in how your country is run should somehow be demeaned as less important than contributing to a charity.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000269"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09050556000545"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, referred to the impact of this, and whether it might treat political parties unfairly in the sense that people on higher incomes, paying higher taxes, might be inclined to vote in a particular way and the benefit would therefore arise for a particular political party. I am not altogether sure about that. In the period up to 1997, if such a scheme had been in operation I am sure that there would not have been very much difference between the application of this principle, whether it applied to Conservative, Labour or Liberal voters. I suspect that Labour was sufficiently popular at that time to have been able to attract as much donation as other political parties. Maybe at the moment, because we have a little difficulty which we all know about, contributions under this system might drop off. That is just the to and fro of politics.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000270"></a>The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, said that he would not support it right now, for reasons that I perfectly understand. I wonder whether the principle could be carried in the legislation. Why cannot we just set a limit of &#163;15, or something? That would establish the principle and would be at minimal cost to the state. By regulation, that figure could be increased over time. It is not something particularly expensive, and I do not know whether all those brilliant people sitting behind the Minister who know all about these matters  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC224"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can advise him very hurriedly on whether it would be possible to introduce a regulation of that nature or whether it would simply be a decision taken in a Budget. It might be that in the course of a Budget the actual figure could be increased, but the fundamental arrangement could be in place to allow those changes to take place. I am very much in favour of that idea. It takes us along the state funding route; it is the beginning of a process. It is a very cheap way of establishing a principle that would, I think, carry very wide public support. I am in favour of state funding, and I am sure that this would sell with the public, because they would feel that at least it was they who were deciding and not the state&#151;whereas, obviously, I would want the state to decide on these matters. I would certainly go down that route, and it is good to see that there is all-party support for the principle.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000271"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09050556000546"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I rise briefly to support the proposal, with an eye on the clock. I do so because the amendment has twin objectives and could kill two birds with one stone. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, I am not in favour of direct state aid, because it does not answer the question of introversion or force parties to look out&#151;it can tend to make them look inwards. However, we need to recognise the need for political parties and that they need funding. We need to reduce the dependency on large donations. For me, it is a way in which to get modest amounts of state aid to parties without having to have the direct connection, which would otherwise be the case.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000272"></a>The second bird that it kills is that of encouraging political parties to reach out. We examine why the turnout in elections is low and falling, but people fail to see their relevance to them. That may be their fault or that of the political parties, but we surely need to make greater efforts to try to build a mass membership. As the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, said, that would be a further encouragement to reach out to present policies in a way that is attractive and is seen to be relevant by our fellow citizens, and would do so in a way that would reward political parties with a modest sum. I agree that the sum should be modest. I am attracted by the idea suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, that we might put a tiny marker down, because the state of our public finances is such that anything more than a tiny marker would be very difficult. But let us get something on the record that would enable us to start this new approach, avoiding direct state funding and encouraging parties to reach out to rebuild a mass membership, which sees the political process as relevant and important to themselves and to the country.</p>

I add my support, too, to what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said, which is something that I have said in the past about allowing for tax relief but doing it on very small amounts. I am attracted by his suggestion that one can have a regulatory mechanism and increase the amount over time.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000274"></a>Although it might seem like quite a technical amendment to some, it is worth stressing what has already been touched on. It is fundamental to the  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC225"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>health of our political system. Political parties are at the heart of a healthy democracy. They aggregate opinion and provide the essential mechanism for accountability in the political process. Without them electors are lost; there is no accountability. We need to stress the fundamental role of parties but recognise that they are under threat at the moment, not least from a shift in the interests of electors to organise interest groups. Such groups help to absorb the energies; they are much more directed, so people are more willing to give to groups than to political parties.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000275"></a>Interest groups enjoy no democratic legitimacy, but it is worth mentioning that some of them enjoy the tax advantages, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that political parties do not. A case has been made that it is essential to try to help to sustain political parties within our political system, but as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has conceded, there is a certain public wariness about direct support from public funds, which is understandable. We already provide indirect support for a whole range of mechanisms, such as free mailing, election broadcasts, Short money and Cranborne money, so there is something coming indirectly. I concur with the argument against going down the route of direct public funding on which I am completely at one with my noble friend Lord Hodgson.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000276"></a>I prefer the option embodied in the amendment for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and my noble friend Lord MacGregor. It is essentially a democratic option in that electors choose how to allocate money. Capping the amount has been mentioned, which would encourage the parties to solicit funding from a wide range of supporters. Perhaps even Mrs Campbell-Savours senior will be solicited.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000277"></a><b><a name="90505-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09050556000548"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> She would not give it to Labour.</p>

They would benefit only established parties&#151;those with two or more MPs. In addition, higher rate taxpayer donations would not attract tax relief.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000280"></a>We understand the motivation for these amendments and confirm that we support and encourage smaller donations from individuals and encourage political parties to reach out to a wide proportion of the population. We, too, have seen the lessons from the Democratic Party&#146;s fundraising ahead of the recent elections in the United States. That is a striking example of how it can be used to good effect.</p>

<a name="90505-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09050556000281"></a>However, we cannot seriously support a proposal that suggests, in effect, an increase in public funding for political parties in the current economic climate. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, was right to point  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC226"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column GC226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out that this is real money. It might not divert public money towards political parties, but it would reduce the amount of money available in the public purse for public expenditure. Even without the current downturn, we are not sure that we shall be presenting political parties as analogous to charities. Gift aid is an important development that encourages donations to charities and helps them to do good work with the additional income they receive as a result, but politics is not charitable work.</p>

The argument that he is advancing suggests that he would now wish to take away that opportunity for those NGOs that campaign on policy issues simply because of the economic crisis. I do not think that that is what the Minister is saying but will he at least accept the irony that charities can be political and have donations set against tax while political parties whose main function is politics cannot?</p>

While the analogy drawn by the noble Lord between political parties and campaigning charities may have some point, I do not believe that is how the public feel about political parties at this moment and we should not press on that basis.</p>

Clearly this is one and we are against the principle of extending it. The Committee probably think more highly of politics and political parties than some other parts of the population, but we cannot support the proposal in the amendment that political parties should benefit from additional sums of taxpayers&#146; money. It is with some temerity that I must shatter this consensus. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000287"></a>I am immensely grateful for the support from all sides of the Committee, if that is the right expression, that I have received for the amendment; that is, from three members of the Labour Party, three members of the Conservatives and my noble friend Lord Tyler.</p>

<p><a name="09050556000288"></a>The amount involved is very small. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, raised the important question of how much it is likely to cost. Having made a quick calculation, almost all gifts will come from members of the political parties, of which there are now about 500,000 between them. Probably only a small proportion of those give more money than their membership

But let us assume that the total membership contributions amount to an average of &#163;40 per member, which is perhaps on the generous side. That includes all donations but cuts out everything above the tax relief limit. If that is so, it would add up to a total of &#163;20 million of donations and the tax relief on that would be about &#163;5million. Even in the days of the credit crunch, &#163;5 million is not an enormous sum to be paid. In any event, it should at least be possible to pass this as legislation but leave it to the Government, who always have the power, to decide when that particular provision should be brought into force.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0905056000004"></a>My right honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the following Statement to the House about the inquests of service personnel who have died overseas.  Our sincere condolences go to the families of the 13 service personnel who have lost their lives in service of their country since the last Statement, and our thoughts and prayers remain with all the families whose loved ones have died on operations. </p>

<a name="90505-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0905056000005"></a>Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on 2 February 2009 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 37WS), with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0905056000008"></a>At the time of the last Statement, we reported that 220 inquests had been held since June 2006: 206 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0905056000009"></a>Since 27 January a further nine inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan.  This makes a total of 230 inquests held since June 2006.  </p>

<a name="90505-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0905056000010"></a>Since operations commenced in 2001 there have been a total of 254 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including four service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries.  In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident. </p>

<a name="90505-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0905056000011"></a>We remain very grateful for the efforts of all the coroners involved in conducting these inquests and unswerving in our support of the independent coronial system.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0905056000016"></a>The Statement in February reported that there was one remaining inquest to be held into a death where the body was repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007, that into the death of Marine Wigley.  That remains the position and the inquest will be heard for five days starting on 11 May.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0905056000018"></a>Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction (since 1 April 2007 fatalities are repatriated via RAF Lyneham).  The coroner transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.  David Masters retired as the Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner on 31 March but his successor, David Ridley, has appointed him as an assistant deputy coroner to ensure that his experience and expertise is retained. </p>

<a name="90505-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="0905056000098"></a>I am today publishing a consultation on proposals for a new Planning Policy Statement 4: <I>Planning for Prosperous Economies</I> (PPS4). Copies of the consultation are being placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="0905056000099"></a>The planning system is a key lever the Government have to contribute towards improving economic performance. The current uncertain economic times have highlighted the need for planning policies at the national, regional and local level to be flexible and responsive so that they support the economic aspirations of our communities, whether in cities, market towns or rural villages.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="0905056000100"></a>In light of this and in keeping with our commitment in our 2007 planning White Paper and the recommendations of the Killian Pretty review, this comprehensive new draft statement brings together in one place all of the Government&#146;s key planning policies relating to the economy and streamlines and simplifies policy to focus on what is important to allow the economy to grow in a sustainable manner.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="0905056000101"></a>The new PPS will, in its final form, replace Planning Policy Guidance Note 4<I>: Industrial, </I><I>C</I><I>ommercial </I><I>D</I><I>evelopment and </I><I>S</I><I>mall </I><I>F</I><I>irms (PPG4, 1992), </I>Planning Policy Guidance Note 5<I>: Simplified Planning Zones  


<notus-date day="5" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS49"></a><b>5 May 2009 : Column WS49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>(PPG5, 1992), </I>Planning Policy Statement 6<I>: Planning for town centres</I> (PPS6, 2005), Planning Policy Statement 7<I>: Sustainable development in rural areas (PPS7</I>) (in so far as it relates to economic development) and paragraphs 53, 54 and Annexe D of Planning Policy Guidance Note<I> 13: Transport.</I></p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="0905056000102"></a>At the heart of our policy is the requirement that development plans need to have clear, proactive, proportionate and flexible policies aimed at supporting the start up and growth of businesses, attracting inward investment and increasing employment, particularly in deprived areas. It emphasises that we need also to protect existing investment in our cities and towns by safeguarding the town centres which are the bedrock of our economic future. Our urban centres are not only the engine of the country&#146;s economy&#151;and through its urban renaissance policy this Government have strengthened the future of many such centres after years of decline&#151;but are also the hub of community life, helping to stitch together communities through cultural, leisure, social and educational facilities.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="0905056000103"></a>The policy statement continues to put town centres first by ensuring that development continues to take place in town centres and promotes their vitality, viability and character. As previously consulted on in draft PPS6, we have removed the &#147;need test&#148; for proposals outside town centres but retained the &#147;sequential test&#148; which requires developers to justify why they cannot build in the centre before they seek to build out of town and strengthened the &#147;impact test&#148; to focus on the potential economic, social and environmental effects of development.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="0905056000104"></a>The revised policy also implements a number of recommendations arising from Matthew Taylor MP&#146;s review of rural housing and economic development. The Government agree with his key finding that we need a more subtle appreciation of what makes rural communities sustainable, and that rural communities, as much as urban areas, need to plan for change in the face of new economic, environmental and demographic pressures. In bringing together our policies on economic development in town and country into one policy statement we are emphasising in the rural context what is taken for granted in urban contexts: that economic sustainability is a prerequisite for social and environmental sustainability.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="0905056000105"></a>Similarly, we are responding to the thrust of the recommendations made in the advice provided to the Prime Minister by Stuart Burgess, the rural advocate. We see both the rural advocate&#146;s report and the Taylor review as important elements of a growing consensus which recognises the economic opportunities offered by rural areas and the contribution they make to the economy at large.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="0905056000106"></a>The draft statement does not include any specific proposals for a &#147;competition test&#148; that was recommended by the Competition Commission. In June 2008, Tesco PLC challenged the commission&#146;s recommendation in the Competition Appeal Tribunal. In March 2009, the application by Tesco was allowed and the recommendation quashed. The tribunal unanimously concluded that the commission, in its report, had failed properly to consider certain matters which were relevant to its recommendation that the competition test be imposed

The Government will await the Competition Commission&#146;s reconsideration of the issue before deciding how to proceed.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="0905056000107"></a>The proposed changes I am setting out today will play a part in facilitating sustainable economic growth in urban and rural areas and ensuring our town centres thrive for years to come. The consultation closes on 28 July 2009.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="0905056000109"></a>The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to set and meet a timetable for the majority of planning cases which are to be decided by her (as opposed to being decided by a planning inspector) and to make a report to Parliament each year on performance. This is intended both to ensure that such cases are dealt with expeditiously and to enable the parties to any particular case to know when they can expect to receive a decision.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="0905056000110"></a>The Secretary of State has accordingly today laid before Parliament an Act Paper reporting on performance on all decisions made between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009 to which statutory timetables apply. Such timetables apply to decisions on called-in planning applications; planning appeals recovered for the Secretary of State&#146;s decision; other cases &#147;linked&#148; to such decisions (including listed building consent and conservation area consent); and appeals against refusals of consent for works to trees covered by tree preservation orders. They do not apply to cases decided by inspectors (which includes all tree preservation order appeals lodged on or after 1 April 2008) or to cases decided by the Secretary of State jointly with a Minister of another department.</p>

<a name="90505-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="0905056000111"></a>During the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009, 73 (95 per cent) of the 77 cases decided by the Secretary of State other than tree preservation order appeals were made within their statutory timetables, as were 415 out of 416 decisions (99.75 per cent) of tree preservation order appeals.</p>

In stem  cell research there are examples of major international joint funding initiatives such as the new partnership between the MRC and the Californian Institute of Regenerative Medicine which aims to support collaboration between scientists in the UK and California. This high level of collaboration results in the production of many research papers worldwide based directly or indirectly on MRC support.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_55"></a><a name="09050518000073"></a>There is frequently a significant time lag between the provision of funding to projects and research publications arising from those projects. The consistent classification of research papers with a primary or significant focus on embryonic, as opposed to other stem cell approaches, requires a careful analysis of the contents of the papers in question. Management information held by the MRC, and extensive datasets such as PubMed, BiomedExpert.com, Faculty of 1000, and Thompson ISI, cannot therefore reliably identify all papers with this research focus without trained scrutiny of the results.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_56"></a><a name="09050518000074"></a>A simple counting of research papers is not a reliable measure of output without information about the quality of these publications. Analysis of the citation rate of research papers, normalised by research field, is an established approach to measuring the impact of publications. This analysis relies on data about citations having accumulated over several years.</p>

In 2008 the MRC, the Wellcome Trust and others funded the US National Library of Medicine to extract data routinely from the acknowledgement field, where available in scientific papers, and flag this information in the PubMed dataset. This has improved information on papers acknowledged as arising from MRC funded work, but is still incomplete. There were over 2,000 MRC attributed papers flagged in PubMed in 2008, which is approximately 60 per cent of the output reported directly to the MRC by researchers. The MRC is working with publishers and researchers to achieve consistent acknowledgement of Government support in all research publications.</p>

The effects of the medication have been assessed through routine epidemiology and theatre reporting systems. In addition, MoD sponsored a research programme into the possible health effects of the combination of vaccines and tablets which were given to troops at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict to protect them against the threat of biological and chemical warfare. The overwhelming evidence from the programme is that the NAPS that were offered to UK forces at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict would not have had adverse health effects. The tablets issued on Op TELIC were the same as those used in the Gulf in 1990-91.</p>

We do not expect these elections to have an impact on the settlement process. Mr Talat is still the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and therefore the negotiator.
