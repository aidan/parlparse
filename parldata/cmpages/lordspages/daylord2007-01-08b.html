<a name="70108-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0701089000015"></a>Troop movement is generally working well. Between April and December 2006, 80 per cent of strategic air transport flights were on time or delayed by less than three hours. For Iraq this figure was 86 per cent and for Afghanistan it was 75 per cent. Recent improvements include refurbishing the runway at Kandahar airfield, which was completed in November 2006. This now allows troops to fly direct rather than via Kabul, which reduces journey times and increases C130 availability.</p>

<a name="70108-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0701089000017"></a>The Minister will be aware that I have raised this issue a number of times from this Dispatch Box. Despite what he says, soldiers tell me that the situation has not improved. Vintage VC10s and Tristars continue to break down, leaving soldiers stranded sometimes for days on end, which is utterly demoralising for them and their families. Who is responsible for the air bridge? If, as I suspect, several different people and groups share responsibility for this unacceptable state of affairs, will the Government take the necessary steps to appoint one senior responsible owner, whose only responsibility would be to get this essential service right?</p>

The noble Lord is right that some of our aircraft are aged. Taking into account the operational tempo with which the RAF is having to cope and the age of some of the fleet, I believe that the RAF is doing an excellent job. The number of troop passengers carried over the past year has gone up by more than 40 per cent, which reflects the tempo that is being coped with.</p>

<a name="70108-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0701089000019"></a>None the less, it is important for us to do whatever we can to improve the situation, which I and the RAF are aware is not as good as we would like it to be. In December, the AOC of 2 Group implemented an initiative to put more focus on the experience, if you like, for our troops in transportation. We hope that this will provide improvements in a number of areas. For example, we are investing in Brize Norton to improve the experience for passengers while they wait. None the less, I will look at what further work we can do to improve this.</p>

Can the Minister explain why, in the public service agreement that his Ministry has signed, the target for improving the deploying, sustaining and recovering of force elements in this area is set at only 5 per cent over a three-year period? Furthermore, how did he manage to achieve the data that he has just given us, given that that public service report in the annual accounts says that a method by which to measure such data has not yet been designed?</p>

That information that I have shared with the House is recorded and is for April to December 2006. The number of Tristar aircraft defined as being fit for purpose to meet the tasking is hitting very close to the 4.75 to 4.8 target. I shall look at the figures relating to the PSA, to which the noble Lord referred. I am not aware of them but, if I can give him any further information, I shall write to him.</p>

Is it not outrageous that troops are being left waiting for long periods due to the inability of these aged airframes to be kept serviceable, no matter how hard the Royal Air Force service ground crews work? Is that not just another example of overcommitment of our Armed Forces over a very extended period, and should it not have been taken into account before we were committed to Afghanistan?</p>

The RAF&#146;s total transport fleet for passengers, freight and air-to-air refuelling is 70-odd aircraft. If we look at the decisions taken by the Government to invest in new aircraft, be they C17s or the A400M, we see that it takes some time for those aircraft to come on stream. The most important project for the air passenger side is the FSTA project. The noble and gallant Lord is absolutely right that that is urgent, and I am well aware that we need to make a decision on it quickly.</p>

However, I will look further at whether there is an increased advantage in focusing more closely on this area. Although, on the face of it, the figures that I quoted look like a pretty good performance, I recognise that the troops have experienced delays, so I will see whether further improvements can be made.</p>

We recognise the importance of aircraft maintainability but other factors, such as the weather, are issues in certain areas in Afghanistan. However, we think that the move that we have made recently will improve flight performance. I shall write to the noble Lord with an answer to his question about specific numbers as I do not have that detail in front of me.</p>

Can the Minister assure us that the same care will be taken to look at the requirements of those in Bosnia and in other such places who are subject to exactly the same sort of problems as have been raised in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan?</p>

Troop movements are crucial to all troops, wherever they serve on operations, as they affect the amount of time that troops have at home with their families. Improving that is at the top of our priority list. I have given the House the data which I think show that, with this level of operational tempo, the RAF does a very good job. Those aircraft are old&#151;some of them go back to the 1960s&#151;so we need to bring new aircraft into service as quickly as possible, as we are committed to do, and we must ensure that we provide the best possible service. The increased focus that the RAF has made on this, as I have just mentioned to the House, is something on which we shall keep a very close eye.</p>

That puts a lot of pressure on the Armed Forces as regards reforms, changes to equipment, tactics and procedures to meet the threat. I believe that we are doing a good job in responding to that. However, there are areas in which we need to improve. We are providing a very clear focus on taking action&#151;for example, on the equipment side&#151;to make those improvements. We listen very clearly to what the Armed Forces say to us at all levels, from a ministerial perspective and from the perspective of the Chiefs of Staff. It is important that we do so. There is no failure of communication.</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What steps they are taking to ensure that the recovery of scrap aluminium sent from the United Kingdom to areas outside the European Union for recycling is carried out in an environmentally sound manner and to the standard required for recycling industries operating within the United Kingdom under the European Union integrated pollution prevention and control regulations.</p>

Defra wrote to all waste collection and disposal authorities in March 2005 regarding the illegal export of waste to European Union and other countries.</p>

That very guidance note from Defra has been part of the problem. I understand, and the Minister should be able to confirm, that Defra said that if there was any oil on aluminium&#151;more than 0.1 per cent&#151;it had to be classified as contaminated waste. At the moment in this country there is higher car production than for many years, the greatest amount of aluminium is being recycled, and every car uses more than 100 kilograms, of which 90 per cent is recycled. By sending that aluminium abroad, as we are obliged to do because in our requirement that there be no oil we are exceeding the EU obligation, we are losing jobs and our economy is being damaged. Will Defra look again at that guidance note to see why we are going that much further than the EU demands?</p>

Is there an explanation for this? If so, can the House hear it?</p>

People are carrying out a legal trade of export. It is all regulated. Aluminium is not a designated hazardous waste therefore we do not have all the figures we would have if it were.</p>

<a name="70108-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0701089000040"></a>We benefit a lot from the recycling of aluminium wherever it is produced, because a huge amount of electricity is used to create it in the first place; therefore, the more that is recycled the better. Where it is recycled, however, is essentially up to the industry.</p>

It is currently less than half. As the Minister said, the environmental issue is that it takes about 90 per cent more energy to produce primary aluminium than it does to recycle it and it can be recycled many times.</p>

The figures for aluminium can recycling are 2 per cent in 1989 and 42 per cent in 2001&#151;that figure is somewhat old, but it is still less than half. Recycling aluminium consumes only 5 per cent of the electricity and energy used in primary aluminium production. A kilogram of recycled aluminium saves six kilograms of bauxite, four kilograms of chemicals and 15 kilowatt hours of electricity. There is a lot to be gained and, I understand, no limit to the number of times aluminium can be recycled.</p>

Perhaps the Minister could have a word with members of the industry. If he did, and they were receptive, we might save jobs in this country and, of course, reduce CO2 and other emissions.</p>

Since their rollover last February, the situation in the country has only worsened: peaceful demonstrations have been violently disrupted, the economy continues to be grossly mismanaged and the opposition and independent media remain suppressed.

Is my noble friend aware that if, for instance, Mugabe were to go to Portugal for the EU-Africa conference in the second half of this year, it would hold up the EU policy to derision and give his regime an unwarranted propaganda victory? That would hugely dismay and demoralise the courageous members of the Movement for Democratic Change, who are trying to secure peaceful change in their country. Consistency is essential; consistency from the whole Union is vital.</p>

Has the Minister seen the remarks attributed to ex-Minister Jonathan Moyo last week on radio SW Africa, when he said that even Zanu-PF leaders are beginning,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000239"></a>&#147;to ask fundamental questions about the state of the economy, the state of the country, and ... the state of their party&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000215"></a>Is it not therefore time to strengthen the restrictions on the ability of those people to travel out of the country or to secrete in foreign banks the assets that they have stolen from their people?</p>

We will certainly make that clear to our colleagues in the African Union. Indeed, the travel ban has been strengthened four times since 2002, to include others who have supported the Government of Zimbabwe&#146;s efforts to suppress the people. As the noble Lord said, nothing has changed and the situation, as Jonathan Moyo pointed out, is worse. We will discuss with our European partners how the renewed common position should reflect this. </p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="0701089000227"></a>&#147;It would send completely the wrong signal if the EU backed down on sanctions now&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000216"></a>They went on to point out that whether the sanctions should be revoked or renewed ought to be determined by measuring Zimbabwe&#146;s progress toward the benchmark originally set by the EU under the EU-ACP Cotonou convention. Will Her Majesty&#146;s Government ensure, as I hope they will, that these representations by the international trade union movement are circulated to all members of the Council of Ministers and that we ensure proper consideration is given to their concern?</p>

Will my noble friend and the other members of the Government remind our more reluctant EU allies of the huge amount of humanitarian aid needed as a result of the Zimbabwean regime&#146;s wanton destruction of housing, industry and agriculture?</p>

I am confident that it will not, but I am sure that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will continue to make the very strong case in favour of sanctions. In respect of aid being given to Zimbabwe, of course we must maintain that aid, but it should be balanced by sanctions, and we must ensure that the people of Zimbabwe are not harmed in any way.</p>

It is extraordinary that such loopholes exist, but they do. The EU Zimbabwe travel ban contains standard exemptions that enable travel to the EU by banned Zimbabweans in a few, narrowly defined cases. We do our utmost to ensure that they are narrowly defined, because to see people such as Grace Mugabe stomping up and down the streets of the C&#244;te d&#146;Azur is an affront to humanity.</p>

It appears on the contrary that, while the ruling tyranny in Zimbabwe is maintaining its position and even strengthening it, more women and children are dying, there is more starvation, more and more other horrors and atrocities are being committed, the country&#146;s economy is less than half the size it was a few years ago, and a great deal of suffering is going on? As we renew pressure on Zimbabwe, should we not look at the other, shadow sanctions which are hurting the poorest people, particularly the withholding of some loans from international institutions and development banks and other investment? Should we not try to refocus the whole of our operation vis-Ã -vis Zimbabwe in ways which hit the criminals who are ruling the country and do not hit the poor people who are starving in very large numbers and longing for greater help, as the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, rightly identified?</p>

However, the EU sanctions put real pressure on the regime. They ensure that Mugabe remains isolated&#151;hence his attempts to seek financial lifelines from China and Iran to buy time. It is important to point out that the targeted sanctions have the support of the democratic opposition and the NGO community in Zimbabwe. Mugabe and his regime detest the restrictions on their movement. Therefore, they can be only a good thing. However, I hear what the noble Lord says, and I shall take back his comments to the Foreign Office.</p>

We wish him well there&#151;it is familiar territory to him&#151;and I am sure that it will not take him long to make his mark there once again.

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0701089000078"></a>We begin our Committee debates with an extremely important amendment which, I venture to suggest, will come as no surprise to the Minister. It  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_13"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would insert a set of key principles into the Mental Health Act 1983. Why this idea is so important can be explained very simply. The Mental Health Act and this amending Bill are not in any sense run-of-the-mill measures. They have two features about them which place them in a class apart from most other legislation: the powers granted to the state and its employees to coerce individuals who are not criminals into being detained and treated, and the fact that those individuals are, almost by definition, some of the most vulnerable of our citizens. The ethical standards governing that key interaction, between state and individual, are not some sort of subsidiary add-on; they are integral to the basic acceptability of the legislation. The principles defining those ethical standards deserve a place at the heart of the Act because it is only in that way that Parliament can signal to practitioners, patients and the legal profession how it wants the Act to be interpreted and implemented. Interpretation and implementation need to be in all our minds from the outset.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0701089000079"></a>The Bill is full of tensions. We will deal with those tensions, I am sure, repeatedly. The most glaring tension is that between patient autonomy on the one hand and public safety on the other, but there is another tension pulling in a third direction: the need to make certain that mental health services remain trusted by service users. To achieve that, we have to ensure not just that coercive powers are used only as a last resort, but also that the ways in which those powers are used are not excessive in any given set of circumstances. By placing these very sensitive measures within a framework of overarching principles, the Bill will be more effective in protecting patients and the public. Why? Because if you make it crystal clear to everybody that the rules of compulsion are underpinned by values, and that because of those values there are times when compulsion is appropriate and times when it is not, you will have legislation that is much clearer and much more likely to command universal respect.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0701089000080"></a>During the past few years of discussion on the two draft Bills there has been much debate about the relationship between the Mental Health Act and the European Convention on Human Rights, not least Article 5(1) which deals with the deprivation of liberty. Since the Human Rights Act was passed in 1998, there has been a succession of legal challenges to the Mental Health Act. It is argued by many people that the absence of a set of principles on the face of the Mental Health Act leaves it wide open to such challenges. I believe that that view is right and that we have a golden opportunity to remedy the lacuna now.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0701089000081"></a>So what principles should the Act enshrine? None of them is unfamiliar but all, I suggest, are crucial. If we look at healthcare more generally, the importance of involving service users as far as possible in their own care is perhaps the most obvious way in which the practice of medicine has evolved over the past 10 or 20 years. It should apply in mental healthcare as it does anywhere else. Indeed it should apply with particular emphasis because when the context of care is one in which compulsory powers may at some point be used, it is all the more important that service users  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_14"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be involved with their own assessment and care. It is only by doing that that users are likely to have confidence in those looking after them. The patient voice is a key plank of the Mental Capacity Act, and so it should be here. We need to promote the idea of patient empowerment. Patients are empowered by being given information and the freedom to make choices for themselves which those around them will respect. That is so even when a patient is subject to compulsion. There is no reason why he should not retain as much autonomy as possible, consistent with his own safety and that of others. Service users should be able to express their views and say what they want and not be criticised for doing so.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_time2"></a><h5><a name="0701089000255"></a>3.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0701089000082"></a>The amendment speaks of the respectful treatment of carers and of patients; it speaks of equal treatment of all groups in society. Here, not surprisingly, individuals from black and ethnic-minority communities are uppermost in my mind. I am sorry to say that respect and equal treatment are not commodities in abundant supply in mental healthcare. Others in this debate will, I am sure, speak with particular authority on that issue, but if we allow ourselves not to address it with absolute seriousness in the context of the Bill, we shall be guilty of failing to get to grips with the stigma and discrimination which hang around mental illness like a yoke. The inclusion of principles in the legislation is a visible recognition by Parliament that stigma, discrimination and racial stereotyping need to be banished. I believe that the amendment will help promote, in their place, a culture of respect and confidence; very importantly, it will also guide the courts.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0701089000083"></a>When a patient is treated, it should be after consideration of a full range of options for that treatment, and after a conscious decision that treating him will be better than not treating him&#151;the first &#147;do no harm&#148; principle. We need to make a statement about child welfare in the context of treatment for mental illness. The Minister may argue that the paramountcy principle is already enshrined in the Children Act 2004, but I firmly believe that we should be explicit about it here. The needs of children are very specific. The provisions on children are dealt with separately under the Act. When we come to debate community treatment orders, we will see that separate provisions for children are included.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0701089000084"></a>We then come to the principle of reciprocity. Where society imposes an obligation on an individual to comply with a programme of treatment and care, it should impose a parallel obligation on health and social care authorities to provide appropriate services. The mental health community feels very strongly about that principle, and I share its view.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0701089000085"></a>The final part of the amendment covers the key issue I referred to earlier: that compulsory treatment should apply only after all alternatives have been exhausted or ruled out. We must never forget what coercion feels like for the person subjected to it. It is deeply traumatic and humiliating, and frequently serves to engender terror of mental health services

It also, almost inevitably, results in severe social disadvantages, not the least of which are employment and housing. Nobody should belittle the magnitude of what is done in the name of the state to administer compulsory detention and treatment to an individual. That is why the principle of least restriction needs to be articulated with absolute clarity.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0701089000086"></a>I like to hope that the Minister will not be unsympathetic to the amendment. If he is in any way hesitant, I put it to him that a clause of this nature, setting the scene on a Bill, is not without precedent in recent legislation. It is worth reminding ourselves of one other thing: while we all agree that our mental health services need to deal fairly and effectively with those who pose a danger to themselves or others, this Bill will affect very many thousands of people who will never harm anyone. We owe it to those people, as much as to any others, to frame the Mental Health Act within a set of clear standards and values. Only in that way will we have an Act that achieves what the Government themselves aspire to: to give all patients, whatever the nature of their illness, the treatment they need. I beg to move.</p>

I also take the opportunity to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, back to his former position as Minister for Health. I can think of nobody better to be in that position, not least because we have the tantalising prospect of discussing patient involvement and patient forums in the near future. I know that those are subjects very close to the noble Lord&#146;s heart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0701089000088"></a>Before following up on a number of the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about why we should have principles on the face of this Bill, it is important to address one other, more fundamental, question. What is the purpose of mental health legislation? I ask because just before Christmas the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, kindly arranged for noble Lords who are interested in this Bill to meet some of the people responsible for its drafting. One of those people made a quite extraordinary statement. He said that the purpose of mental health legislation was to give practitioners the tools that they need to make people better. That is a partial truth and, because it is a very partial truth, quite a dangerous statement.</p>

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0701089000089"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, pointed out, this is a subject with a long-standing history of sensitivity around such matters as compulsory treatment and the detention of individuals. The purpose of mental health legislation is to set the ethical framework and agreed standards, held by society to be true, for people who are perhaps among the most vulnerable of its number. As such, it entails questions of autonomy, safety, liberty, the role of the state, science and clinical judgment. The role of mental health legislation is to provide the framework by which clinicians and their activities are judged. Given that the architects of the Bill have chosen to project it in such a limited and partial way, it is our view on these Benches that there is, perhaps, a greater need than ever to have

<a name="70108-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0701089000090"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has talked about the importance of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;the right to liberty and security of the person&#151;as the key piece of European legislation into which ours must fit. Ever since 1999, the Government have received advice about the ethical nature of any future mental health Act. In 1999, the Richardson committee stated that any new Act should be based on principles of autonomy and non-discrimination. Importantly, that report was accepted by the Health Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0701089000091"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, also said, there are immediate parallels to which the Committee may look. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 begins with a statement of principles to which practitioners must have regard. More than that, the Government&#146;s draft Bill of 2004, which was the subject of the work of the Joint Scrutiny Committee, included at its beginning three principles&#151;that patients should be involved in decision-making, that decisions should be made fairly and openly, and that interference to patients in providing medical treatment and restrictions imposed on them during treatment should be kept to a minimum to protect their health and safety and that of others. So the Government themselves, in 2004, could see a case for having principles included in the legislation.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0701089000092"></a>In the run-up to this Bill, there has been a fair degree of discussion about whether principles should be included in the Bill, as one would expect. The argument that has most frequently been deployed by Ministers is that principles may lose their authority or appropriateness over time, and if they are on the face of the legislation rather than in a code of practice they become more difficult to change. I do not accept that argument. Principles should be enduring. But even if they change&#151;and sometimes they do&#151;they are usually changes of such importance that they should be debated by Parliament.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0701089000093"></a>Over the past 30 years, the attitude of society and of the psychiatric profession to homosexuals, for example, has changed. Homosexuality is no longer defined as a mental disorder. Rightly, that change was the subject of widespread discussion in society and Parliament. I do not believe that any of the principles we put forward in this amendment would be any less durable. Nor should any change to them be of such minor importance that it should not come before Parliament.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0701089000094"></a>Why should principles be on the face of the Bill? The key issue is safety. If we have principles that set the parameters within which all clinical judgments are made, patients and practitioners will have more faith in the safety of those decisions. As a consequence, people will be more likely to avail themselves of treatment. Throughout discussion of the Bill, we will return time and again to the issue of safety and what will help or hinder practitioners as they seek to reach

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0701089000095"></a>We have the benefit of having been through so many drafts on this Bill that we have a lot of material with which to work. Commenting on the draft 2002 Bill, the Joint Committee on Human Rights said that the capacity of a code of practice to give sufficient protection to the human rights of patients in the decision-making process was unclear, and that it should be clarified by putting principles on the face of the legislation. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, we also have other examples near to hand. We have principles in the Children Act 2004 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005&#151;cornerstones to everybody who has to implement those pieces of legislation that specify what the legislation seeks to achieve and what considerations should be fundamental and underlie any actions. We have not yet heard why people who are subject to compulsory mental health legislation deserve less.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0701089000096"></a>Which principles should be included? The Joint Scrutiny Committee spent a great deal of time considering this issue. We decided that the principles in the Scottish Act would be consistent with good practice nationally and internationally. We thought they should serve as the basis for legislation in this country. The principles laid out in this amendment exactly reflect the legislative situation as it is being implemented in Scotland.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0701089000097"></a>There are principles in the code of practice. I do not know if noble Lords have had a chance to study them in any detail, but they should. There is similarity yet also a great difference in emphasis between the list of principles which the Government subscribe to&#151;we assume, because of their presence in the code of practice&#151;and those in our amendment. I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to two in particular. First, the Government talk about a participation principle&#151;that care and treatment should be provided in such a way as to promote a patient&#146;s participation, self-determination and personal responsibility to the greatest practicable degree. It is questionable whether giving personal responsibility to people is a principle of mental health care, as it is a principle more generally extended throughout healthcare. I am not clear why the Government should believe that this principle should have to be applied to people who are mentally ill.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0701089000098"></a>Secondly, the non-discrimination principle bears a striking resemblance to what, in the world outside, one would call the equal opportunities framework&#151;the principle that is in the amendment. Remarkably, the code of practice does not include disability. Why do the Government not believe that disability should be included as a basis on which people should not be treated less favourably under mental health legislation?</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0701089000099"></a>There are other principles in the amendment relating to children which are not in the code of practice. It is difficult to change and to challenge principles when they are in a code of practice. There is not an easy means for us to do so. Nor is it easy to  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_18"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>determine, from reading the code of practice&#151;a lengthy document&#151;exactly what weight, if any, principles have in relation to the rest of the proposals. What happens when there is a conflict? Some of the principles are indeed conflicting. Those issues were grappled with at length by noble Lords involved in the Mental Capacity Act 2005. We had extensive discussions about principles, and about the circumstances in which principles such as best interest should be over-ridden. In this legislation, given its importance, it is necessary that we have the same framework.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0701089000100"></a>The Government have already said that it would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to include principles on the face of this Bill because it is an amendment of the Mental Health Act 1983. Which parts of the 1983 Act would be incompatible with the list of principles in the amendment? I struggle to find parts of that Bill that could be enacted in a discriminatory way and would be in conflict with these principles, which as I say reflect to a large extent international good practice.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0701089000101"></a>One of the main reasons for including principles is to give guidance and confidence, not only to practitioners and to patients but to tribunals, to lawyers who have to implement the legislation, and to users. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, set out that case at length. The Government may believe that it would be wrong to restate principles that are set out in other legislation, but it is not an argument that I find compelling. The Children Act&#146;s paramountcy principle is repeated in various different pieces of legislation that relate to children. Therefore, I do not see why we should not have the principles included in this legislation.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0701089000102"></a>I leave it to others to go through in some detail the reasons for the different principles that are set out in the amendment. However, there is one in particular that needs to be singled out&#151;the principle of reciprocity. If people are to be subjected to compulsory treatment under mental health legislation, it must be an absolute point of principle that there is reciprocity and that services are available to them. I do not believe that in this day and age we could condemn people to be subject to compulsory treatment and then not make services available to them.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0701089000103"></a>This is one of those pieces of legislation on major social topics that comes around once in a generation. Noble Lords have participated in many of those debates in the past; I refer to debates such as those on the adoption Bill. This is our opportunity, and perhaps the only one that we will get for the foreseeable future, to set out in terms what we believe is now, in this country, an acceptable way in which to treat people who have a mental illness. It is important that we do so as clearly as we can&#151;and for the avoidance of any doubt about what we believe the purpose of this legislation to be, it is necessary that we accept an amendment of this nature.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0701089000105"></a>We all want to have confidence that this Bill will protect the public in so far as legislation can; that it will be respected, if not always liked, by service users; that it feels fair and just to relatives and provides an ethical set of principles within which professionals work. In trying to provide that ethical set of principles, we should go back to the inherent principles in this Bill and all mental health legislation since the Vagrancy Act 1714. That Act specifically included the &#147;furiously mad&#148; among those who should be detained in bridewells but specifically excluded them from the punishment meted out to rogues and vagabonds and set some rules as to how they were to be treated.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0701089000106"></a>The primary purpose is to permit interventions to stop individuals from harming others or themselves should mental disorder impair their judgment to the extent that the usual psychological, moral and legal constraints no longer apply. Secondly, the purpose is to constrain those professionals charged with intervening. So in Committee today we are talking about the counterbalancing principles within which we take away freedom&#151;and I remind noble Lords that this is almost the only time, outside the criminal justice system, when we do that. We must balance compulsion against what society offers to those compelled. There are other public health provisions to detain physically ill or aged people in the public interest, but they are now very rarely used, generally out of favour and many people think that they should no longer be on the statute book. At present, it happens about 46,000 times every year.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0701089000107"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, remarked, every mental health patient knows about these powers and fears their use. Even people with quite mild depressive symptoms&#151;I would guess that there are noble Lords in the House who have experienced those&#151;sometimes feel as if they are going mad. They might lose control and be taken away under a section. When I mentioned pink forms in the House, everybody knew what they were for.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0701089000108"></a>The Government have an extraordinary opportunity to set a new cultural context within which mental health services are delivered. They know that they have been, albeit unwittingly, the instrument that has managed at long last to unite service users, families, health and social care professionals and campaigning organisations to agree on some fundamental principles within which care should be delivered to those under compulsion. Although I know that there are healthcare professionals who support other parts of the legislation that I have my doubts about, we are all agreed&#151;even those psychiatrists who have expressed support for some parts of the Bill&#151;on the general principles outlined today.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0701089000109"></a>We know that the Government are not against principles, because there are some in the draft code of practice. Indeed, the National Service Framework for Mental Health has a splendid set of 10 guiding principles. Nowhere in the framework document is there any statement that it does not apply to those under compulsion. They are reflected in many of the principles tabled in this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0701089000110"></a>I understand that there has been much talk of this being an amending Act and that therefore there are clauses in the 1983 Act that might not be consistent with the new principles. My own trawl through the 1983 Act suggests that there is only one area, in Part IV, dealing with patients under criminal proceedings, which might not be entirely consistent, but it does not seem to be beyond the wit of man or the Government to introduce a small amendment to deal with them. This is such an important issue. I do not see any reason why in future principles for mental health should be abandoned because of one or two clauses that might need slight amendment. Principles should apply to those restricted as a result of criminal proceedings, if they have a mental disorder.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0701089000111"></a>If the Bill is to contain the reciprocity of principles, which principles will we adopt? We have proposed here those that the Scots have found in their recent Bill to cover the fundamentals. They are very similar, with minor differences of emphasis, to those recommended in the Richardson expert report in 1999 and were supported by the joint scrutiny committee. Summed up, they are designed: to promote patient autonomy and involvement and, when possible, to provide choice within the necessary constraints; to respect and involve carers; to promote equality, non-discrimination and respect for diversity; to provide for the least restrictive or invasive alternative; to maximise the benefit to the patient and act always in their best interest; to clarify that the welfare of any child under the Act should be consistent with the principles of the Children Act; and to recognise that the state has a reciprocal duty of care to exchange necessary compulsion with the promise of beneficial care and support.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0701089000112"></a>I first heard most of these principles outlined by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale of Richmond&#151;now our first woman Law Lord, but then plain Brenda Hoggett&#151;at a joint meeting of psychiatrists and lawyers in 1989. I wrote them down, right then. Those who go back to see what Brenda Hoggett wrote then will see that these principles have been around, talked about and supported by those who need to use mental health legislation for a long time. They are entirely consistent with the Government&#146;s wish to improve public safety. I hope that, with so much to gain and every patient, every caring family and professional urging them to accept these principles on the face of the Bill, the Government will accept the amendment.</p>

Today we are not talking about fringe benefits but about something that goes absolutely to the heart of the Bill, and which will decisively influence how it is used. Therefore, I am very pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, can be welcomed to his new ministerial brief with a debate on such a key issue.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0701089000115"></a>Principles are important, and they deserve to be on the face of the Bill because they make it clear to practitioners, tribunals and, importantly, service users and their families and carers what standards are expected from mental health law. This argument was accepted by the Government in relation to the Mental Capacity Act. I served on the Joint Committee that scrutinised that legislation when it was in draft form as the Mental Incapacity Bill, under the chairmanship of the late Lord Carter, whose sad loss last month will be keenly felt in this House, in particular by those of us with an interest in disability issues. Lord Carter always took a great interest in disability, influenced in part by his own family&#146;s experience. He was a great ally in improving a number of recent pieces of legislation on disabled people. He and I were the only people to serve on all three of the Joint Committees that scrutinised the draft Disability Discrimination Bill, the draft Mental Incapacity Bill and the draft Mental Health Bill, Lord Carter very ably chairing two out of the three. I am certain that we shall miss him in the months and years to come.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0701089000116"></a>One of our key recommendations in respect of what is now the Mental Capacity Act 2005 was that guiding principles should be on the face of that legislation. We were influenced in this, as noble Lords have heard, by the evidence on the usefulness of principles in the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002. The Government accepted that recommendation, and the Mental Capacity Act now contains at the beginning a very helpful statement of principles. When I served on the Joint Committee that scrutinised the previous version of the Bill, one of our recommendations was that principles should appear in this legislation. We said then that,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000240"></a>&#147;putting principles on the face of a major piece of complex legislation serves a clear purpose, in that it helps to make clear to everyone implementing the Act, what the legislation is trying to achieve and what considerations should guide their actions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000217"></a>It is fair to say that the Government were not sympathetic to very many of our recommendations, but they have agreed with us on this, and in their response to our report they accepted that principles ought to be set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para23"></a>

In this case, we are making wholesale amendments to the Mental Health Act 1983, which presents an ideal opportunity both to set out a clear statement of principles and to iron out any consequent inconsistencies. It is hard for me to imagine circumstances in which treating patients less favourably than non-patients might be in line with best practice, but I am not a practitioner, and I may need to be set right on that and on all of the principles in Amendment No. 1. However, it seems to me that if the Mental Health Act as it now stands is inconsistent with the principle of patient participation, then it is the Act and not the principle that is at fault. Again, if the Mental Health Act as it now stands is inconsistent with the principle of non-discrimination,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000241"></a>&#147;on the grounds of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, colour ... language, religion or national, ethnic or social origin&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000218"></a>it is the Act and not the principle that is at fault. The same goes for all the important principles set out in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0701089000118"></a>It is fortunate indeed, then, that this Bill gives us the opportunity now to amend the 1983 Act both to include principles and to ensure that it meets those principles. Perhaps the Minister could let us know precisely which parts of the Bill violate those principles and then bring forward amendments to change it accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps he could let us know precisely which of these principles he thinks should be violated in the discharge of mental health legislation.</p>

What strikes me is that, although the current Mental Health Act was never intended to sow fear into the hearts of the black community, to which I speak daily, or into the hearts of many people who have a mental health challenge or know someone who has a mental health challenge, it does sow fear into the hearts of those communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0701089000120"></a>I should declare my interest as an employee of the organisation Turning Point, which provides significant services to people with mental health challenges. I know from our service provision and from talking to our clients how critical this amendment is to the confidence that many outside this House will have in whatever we do next with the Bill. The principles are crucial and I hope that one of the easier things that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will have to do in his new job is to agree with us on that. Once we have agreed the principles, the rest becomes a little easier. To be honest, I do not understand why the Government would seek to gainsay this argument. This is one of the few occasions on which the voluntary sector, the royal colleges and many other organisations have been in total agreement. They accept that this set of principles&#151;and one could argue about principles from here to kingdom come&#151;are crucial.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0701089000121"></a>Let me explain a little why I support the amendment. We have an opportunity to set in stone how this legislation should be applied and how it  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_23"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens. As has been stated, the legislation is likely to last for several years, so we may not get an opportunity to do this again. The principles are a vital safeguard to ensure that clinicians and others responsible for administering the legislation do not drift too far from the original intentions. It would be a crying shame if in years to come we were forced to debate mental health in a similar climate to the one in which we are currently debating it. This is a crucial opportunity to ensure that mental health legislation that allows for compulsory care is applied in the right way in the first place, before being subject to challenge. The current Mental Health Act has been subject to a number of successful challenges under the Human Rights Act 1998 precisely because of its lack of principles.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0701089000122"></a>Let me refer to some of the specific principles that are being suggested. One is to take note of,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000242"></a>&#147;the present and past wishes and feelings of the patient&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70108-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0701089000123"></a>I do not mind telling noble Lords that I have had several conversations with people using Turning Point&#146;s mental health services and in my role as co-chair of the Government&#146;s <I>Delivering Race Equality in Mental Health Care</I> strategy. They have a huge fear that, if or when they become subject to the Act, their ability to make decisions about any aspect of their care&#151;even those which do not relate to compulsion&#151;will simply not be respected. They fear not being consulted or included, and that undermines their dignity and confidence in approaching the mental health services, including voluntary services, for help. For example, this principle is relevant to concerns about levels and types of medication: it would be especially reassuring to individuals to know that their views on medication and its side-effects&#151;a huge issue for people in the mental health system&#151;could be taken into account.</p>

<a name="70108-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0701089000124"></a>I am aware that my noble friend Lord Patel of Bradford will put forward amendments, which I hope to support, to strengthen the race equality and diversity issues in the Bill, but I, the Government and all noble Lords know that people from black and minority-ethnic groups are discriminated against in the mental health system. The Act affects them disproportionately. We have already said in this House that reports such as <I>Breaking the Circles of Fear</I> and others describe people&#146;s fear of mental health services, which, in any other situation, would be a cause for outrage and much concern. Such fears are very real. In this climate and in the light of tangible evidence of overuse of the Mental Health Act, the onus is on the Government to demonstrate in the Bill that the new mental health legislation will not discriminate against BME groups. Putting a principle in the Bill about non-discrimination and respect for diversity is essential in achieving that. Such a principle will support, rather than undermine, the fundamental aims of the delivering race equality strategy&#151;for example, more appropriate and responsive services&#151;and the vital progress being made outside the Act in projects such as the DRE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0701089000125"></a>It is important to have principles in the Bill and not just in the code, as we know that that will help to ensure that legislation is used appropriately. This legislation is going to be around for a lot longer than many of us. Principles are a crucial safeguard and it is critical that they have statutory force. They will give more confidence and stronger guidance to tribunals and lawyers faced with interpreting the legislation, to practitioners concerned about how to implement it, and to people who may be subject to the Act and who are worried about how it might affect them. They would also set and help to raise ethical standards in mental health care and achieve greater transparency.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0701089000126"></a>I wish to comment further on some specific principles and turn, first, to the importance of patient participation. The value of service users&#146; involvement and participation in their care is widely recognised in voluntary mental health provision and other areas of healthcare. When the context is one of using compulsory powers, it is all the more important that service users subject to the Act are fully involved as much as possible at all stages of their assessment and care. That is likely to enhance their engagement with practitioners and, therefore, treatment outcomes. I give as an example the case of John, who has written a crisis plan for mental health professionals to consider if he becomes unwell again in the future. It includes asking whether, if possible, when he is admitted to hospital, he may be accompanied by his father rather than a social worker and the police, and it asks that he should not be taken to the locked ward where he has had bad experiences in the past. This makes John feel that he can participate in what can be a highly traumatic sectioning process.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0701089000127"></a>My second point concerns providing the necessary information and support to enable participation. In order for their involvement to be effective and meaningful, service users should be given all the necessary information about how to lodge an appeal to mental health review tribunals. We assume that people know these things but, in fact, in many cases they are simply lost in the system and do not have the information. People should know how to contact patient advocacy services and have information about their medication. Information should also be provided in a form that they can understand, taking into account the needs of those with literacy problems or the increasing number of people whose first language is not English.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0701089000128"></a>I want to comment on the principle that the past and present wishes and feelings of patients should be taken into account. Patient autonomy is the freedom to decide for oneself and the ability to make choices which others will respect. The Department of Health&#146;s <I>Review of the Mental Health Act 1983: Report of the Expert Committee</I> pointed that out.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0701089000129"></a>Practitioners must recognise that many patients retain decision-making ability in relation to many decisions, despite the necessity for detention under the Act. Patients should have a right to continue to make such decisions, subject to their health and safety and the safety of others. Patient choice, which is a  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_25"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fundamental objective of government policy, should not be limited to those with physical health conditions alone. For example, following an assessment of Ms B, it has been decided that compulsory treatment is necessary and that that should be through a supervised community treatment order. However, Ms B does not feel safe in a community environment and would prefer to be treated in a hospital setting. Those issues need to be taken seriously and need to be set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0701089000130"></a>Finally, I want to comment again on racial equality, non-discrimination and respect for diversity. There is considerable evidence that the current Act is applied more heavily among African and Caribbean people than among other groups. A statement of non-discrimination specifically in the context of the Mental Health Act would give those people a basis for confidence in the law. Importantly, this principle should go beyond non-discrimination and include respect for diversity, which indicates the need for practitioners and tribunals to take a proactive stance. </p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0701089000131"></a>Principles play a critical role in giving the BME community confidence in the professionals who exercise powers under the Act. The inclusion of principles in the Bill would be a visible recognition by Parliament of the need to overcome stigma and discrimination. That would assist the development of a culture of respect for the qualities, abilities and diverse backgrounds of individuals. It would also help to avoid making general assumptions on the basis of ethnic, cultural and religious stereotypes. Here I note the work of the Mental Health Act Commission in putting a spotlight on the assumptions that have led to the horrendous treatment of many people from black and minority ethnic communities in our mental health system. Crucially, it will also guide the development of future case law by establishing parameters for judicial interpretations of the Act. That will enshrine race equality in all future developments of the legislation.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0701089000132"></a>On this Bill, we stand at a pivotal point. We should take the Bill seriously. We should take seriously the idea that it will affect the freedoms and views of many thousands of people in their relationships with society through the mental health services and we should put the principles in the Bill to reassure people who, at the moment, are not using the mental health services, but who may need them in the future. I urge the Government to take the principles seriously, to accept the amendment and to work with us all to turn the Bill into something in which many people outside the House can have confidence.</p>

I am convinced that a list of guiding principles is crucial and should be inserted into the Bill. In that, I am supported by Mind, of which I am president, and by many other expert and experienced mental health charities.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0701089000134"></a>The principles are worth restating, even in headline form. The list shows both the ambition and the centrality of the guiding principles. They concern  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_26"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>patient participation, the right to information, autonomy, respect for carers, the availability of a full range of options, equality with people who are not patients, racial equality, non-discrimination, respect for diversity, the maximising of benefit, child welfare and reciprocity. Moreover, there should be an overall requirement in the Bill for the least restrictive alternative, including informal treatment and care.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0701089000135"></a>Why not put the principles in the Bill? Why put them in the code of practice, but not in the Bill? Why not, when these principles will serve a vital purpose for practitioners, many of whom&#151;for example, the Royal College of Psychiatrists&#151;support this, accede to their wisdom and put the principles in the Bill where both practitioners and patients can see them equally? Why not be guided by the democratic option? The Government&#146;s objections seem to be merely defensively technical. It would be a nailing of colours to the mast: a clear and encouraging act of faith, evidence of conviction and purpose worthy of, at its best, a fine, liberalising Government.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0701089000136"></a>Reiteration follows, but I contend that reiteration is evidence of widespread concern and strong, well informed feeling across the spectrum. The amendment is of crucial importance. Principles in the Bill should and will raise ethical standards in mental healthcare by guiding practitioners and lawyers in the implementation and interpretation of the law. That will also improve people&#146;s confidence in the legislation, particularly those who may be subject to it. We particularly need principles in a law which authorises the use of coercive powers, to guard against expedience, discrimination and abuse, and to encourage proactive efforts in favour of patients&#146; rights and well-being.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0701089000137"></a>Principles should not be left to the code of practice, where they could be changed without Parliament&#146;s agreement and would carry less weight. If the Mental Health Act becomes incompatible with any of these principles, those of its aspects should be amended. Such essential principles should be at least as enduring as the legislation. For example, principles of participation, right to information and patient autonomy would all help to counter the kind of situation where people are, or feel, coerced into agreeing to treatment, or are effectively told that there is no point in refusing. In a Mind survey of people&#146;s experiences with ECT, over half the total sample and one third of those who had had ECT most recently were not aware that they could refuse to consent to the treatment. People detained under the Act who consent to treatment do not get the second-opinion safeguard.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0701089000138"></a>The following quotations are from people who had had ECT in the previous six months not many years ago:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0701089000235"></a>&#147;I was told that as I was on a Section 3 ... I had no rights&#148;.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0701089000236"></a>&#147;If I had known I had the right to refuse, I would have done so. My understanding was that I had no choice in the matter and that they could do it by force&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70108-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0701089000139"></a>On racial equality, non-discrimination and respect for diversity, racial inequalities in mental health have been documented in the &#147;Count Me In&#148; census of 2005, particularly for African-Caribbean peoples,  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_27"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including higher rates of detention. That needs tackling at every level, including the guiding principles in the Mental Health Act, because of the unequal treatment that could be carried out under the Act and because it will operate in circumstances where inequalities already exist. The existence of race relations legislation does not obviate the need for inclusion in this Bill. Those rights and duties should be reinforced by the Mental Health Bill, not treated as being taken care of elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0701089000140"></a>My final example refers to something that will come up again and again: patient autonomy. The Mental Health Act clearly restricts patient autonomy by authorising the use of compulsory detention and treatment. That makes it all the more important to include a principle that people should retain as much autonomy as possible. They may have decision-making ability in many of the areas where decisions must be made. For example, it may be necessary for someone to receive treatment under compulsory powers, but they may have views and knowledge about which treatments have previously helped or harmed them. Alternatively, there may be activities or therapies available which the patients would be willing to explore and over which they could be offered real choice, rather than either not having them or having them presented as part of a compulsory package. People should be supported to make their own decisions where possible and given the same choices as people with physical health conditions. Autonomy should be curtailed only to the extent that it is absolutely necessary, and making that a principle in the Bill makes this clear.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0701089000141"></a>I hope that my noble friend seizes the day and accepts this amendment. I urge the Government to take full note of it. Accepting this amendment would go far to help clarify and reassure those in an area which is, at last and thankfully, ceasing to be an area of darkness.</p>

<p><a name="st_56"></a>

I am among those of your Lordships who would like to welcome back the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. I have agreed with his views on a whole range of issues over many years, and it only remains for him to agree with me for us to arrive at a satisfactory solution.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0701089000143"></a>I have it in mind that by the time the Bill becomes law and is implemented it will be about a quarter of a century since the passing of the Mental Health Act 1983. It might well be another quarter of a century before we have the opportunity to set out fully in legislation the principles that we believe in and to make the improvements that we seek within primary legislation. So we need to be bold and to establish in this Bill certain key principles that will stand for many years and bring a good deal of confidence back into mental health provision.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0701089000144"></a>I am for a bold approach. If in fact some of the principles set out in the amendment do not exactly match some provisions in the 1983 Act, then we should make some small change in that Act to make it possible to adopt this amendment within the Bill. I  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_28"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>really want to see this established for the medium-term; that would be good for the mental health community as a whole.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0701089000145"></a>I will refer briefly to three basic points arising from the amendment. First, there is,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000243"></a>&#147;the importance of the patient participating as fully as is possible&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000219"></a>in the discharge of the activities that concern him or her. We should emphasise that important point and set it out right at the beginning of the Bill. We then have the reference in the principles to carers. If we cast our minds back only five or 10 years, there would have been no reference to carers, who were very much on the margin. There has been a huge change of attitude in that area. I was a carer for many years and know what the attitudes are. It is important to get the views of the carer set out in the principles.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0701089000146"></a>Another important point is the question of separate treatment of children or young persons. We are coming to amendments, to one of which I have put my name, about the age appropriate setting. I really hold that view and would therefore like to see it in the principles.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0701089000147"></a>Lastly, there is the question of the,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000244"></a>&#147;reciprocal duty to provide treatment and support&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000220"></a>That reflects Amendment No. 55, which stands in my name and to which we shall come eventually. There is a widespread feeling now that this is what we believe in. We have not expressed it very well before. Let us express these principles in this Bill, take a bold step and get it clear. It will last for a long time, and we shall all welcome that.</p>

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="0701089000148"></a><b><a name="70108-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0701089000325"></a>Lord Warner:</b> I start by wishing my noble friend Lord Hunt well in his new job. I am sorry if my departure has caused him to take a crash course on the Bill, but he is of course well versed in the NHS and I am sure that he will cope well. Just to reduce expectations around the Committee, let me reassure my noble friend that I am not about to say anything that I would not have been prepared to say if I had been in his place.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0701089000149"></a>I understand well the arguments against putting a set of principles into the Bill, which after all amends the 1983 Act and does not start afresh as the original draft Bill did. If at this stage we put any set of principles into the Bill, it will require the parliamentary draftsman to comb through the rest of the Bill to ensure that all its provisions are totally consistent with those principles. I detected a slight feeling among other noble Lords who have spoken that this would be a simple job to do in a couple of hours on a wet afternoon in January or February, but it is a bit more complicated than that.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0701089000150"></a>The longer and more complex the list of principles, the more arduous the task of ensuring the compatibility of the amending legislation with those superimposed principles, which is what they are at this stage in the legislation. This is a real practical consideration that cannot be wished way. Many people who criticised the original Bill argued for a simple amending Bill, so, to some extent, they cannot have it both ways. The Government have gone for a simple amending Bill rather than the original new  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_29"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>blockbuster Bill starting from scratch in which the principles were to be set out. This is a different set of circumstances. An amending Bill makes it inherently more difficult to superimpose a set of guiding principles.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0701089000151"></a>In practice, it is easier to place those guiding principles in the statutory code of practice, which has been a little too easily dismissed in the debate so far. Those guiding principles would be in a code that has statutory force and would be taken account of by the courts. I have to let the Committee know very gently that practitioners do not assiduously study the legislation passed in this House or the other place. They tend to turn to the code of practice for their guidance, which is what it is for. So putting principles in the code of practice is not a lesser option, but is a practical option for shaping the behaviour of practitioners. From listening to the debate so far, I sense that many speakers want to shape the practice of practitioners. The code of practice is one of the places, if not the main place, where we can influence and shape the behaviour of practitioners.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0701089000152"></a>I understand only too well that many people would like to see guiding principles in the Bill. I can see why they want that, but I have some difficulty with the approach adopted by this amendment. I am not completely convinced that everything in it is a guiding principle. Some provisions simply urge practitioners to balance a number of potentially conflicting considerations&#151;for example, paragraphs (d), (f) and (j)&#151;whereas paragraph (g) is a guiding principle. The paragraphs are not consistently framed as principles; they may well be good statements of intent, but they are not necessarily guiding principles. I also have some difficulty with how one would apply paragraph (c) as currently drafted. It embodies a noble aspiration, but it is not necessarily one that is easy to apply as presently framed.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0701089000153"></a>I recognise that this debate shows that a considerable body of opinion is very attached to the idea of placing guiding principles in the Bill and that much of the opposition to the Bill in its present form might be abated if we could fashion a workable set of key principles to put in the Bill. If we are to move down this path&#151;and at present I am not yet convinced that it is practical to do so&#151;I favour having genuine principles like the headings for the guiding principles in the statutory code. Indeed, I would much prefer the Bill to limit itself to a minimum list of headings for principles that the code should spell out. They would still have the force of law, but that would make it easier to recast the code if opinions and circumstances change.</p>

We seem to be able to change our mental health legislation only about once every quarter of a century. Given the pace of change in many areas of healthcare, we may find that we are legislating here with some principles which may not stand the test of time. I would prefer the little extra flexibility that would be gained by being able to amend the code of practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0701089000155"></a>I reassure my noble friend that I am not in any way urging him to accept this amendment as it stands. I am certainly not trying to behave like many of those Permanent Secretaries in the past who, I remember only too well, suddenly became in favour of freedom of information legislation once their Civil Service pensions were secure. However, I wonder whether it would not be worth giving some urgent consideration, across all sections of the Committee, to whether agreement could be reached on a more limited set of key principles for shaping the code of practice which might go in the Bill. That seems to me to be a more practicable way forward, and it would respond to what are clearly strongly held views on this issue across the Committee.</p>

<a name="70108-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0701089000156"></a>I hope that my noble friend will be able to give some sympathetic consideration to an approach of this kind so that we might then be able to move forward with this Bill in a way that is acceptable to many of those who have a great interest in it.</p>

A number of noble Lords have said that Section 1 of the Scottish legislation of 2003 contains a statement that is very similar to that put forward by my noble friend and others. Does the Minister have any news of how that legislation is going? How is it meeting the needs of Scotland and has there been any legal challenge to it? The Scottish Act refers to the whole of mental health legislation and only Part 7 relates to compulsory detention, so I ask him only about that. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, clearly sees the problems that that will arise as a result of this amendment&#151;I suspect that he saw them at Second Reading. He made a helpful speech. I wonder whether the Minister&#146;s reply will fit in well with it. It would be encouraging if it did. Will the Minister tell us what the news is from Scotland? The Act there has been in operation since October 2005. There must be some evidence of whether the problems which the noble Lord, Lord Warner, sees have arisen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0701089000159"></a>Perhaps I may tell noble Lords a short story. Some years ago, a young female employee of Imperial College&#151;she was a brilliant young scientist who was working on the ovary in my laboratory&#151;ended up with a quite severe bipolar disorder, with alternating depression and mania. After a while, she became completely impossible at work and caused great disruption. She eventually gained inappropriate access to my laboratory, against the wishes and the instructions of the university, and caused mayhem. One morning, at about 6.30, she rang me at home in huge distress, crying and screaming that they had come to section her. I said to her, &#147;Hang on, just calm down. Speak to me in a calm voice and, above all, speak to the people who you think have come for you  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_31"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in a calm voice&#148;. She had great difficulty in doing that. What she saw as an attack on her, that complete ignorance and the notion that she had no autonomy at all in her state, had a massively bad impact on her health at the time, and on her attitude towards psychiatrists for a long time afterwards and to her subsequent care. Only with the greatest of difficulties could I persuade the medical people there who did not know her and who had come to section her to wait until I could arrive at her house to intercede on her behalf and to offer guarantees. Of course her behaviour had been unacceptable to the university, of course she was at risk of damaging herself, but her autonomy was easily lost in the culture which was present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0701089000160"></a>I know my noble friend Lord Warner has said that it is massively difficult to change the drafting of a Bill if you have a preamble of this sort beforehand, but if that results in an injustice and in something which makes the law less adequate, it may be none the less necessary for parliamentary draftsmen to work not just for two wet days&#151;if it takes six months, it is still worth getting the law in order. I want to congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on introducing this amendment. It may not be the final wording but it seems to me to be the absolute basis for something which must be in the minds of the carers when they consider sectioning a patient. This young PhD student is now a brilliant doctor of philosophy, working not in this country any more but in another part of the United Kingdom highly successfully. It was touch and go that her career was not permanently damaged because of the result on her health, and I beg the Minister to consider what he could do to try and come to an agreement to put these principles into a position where they might be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0701089000162"></a>I was very moved by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Winston, who described a situation very familiar to me, as a consultant psychiatrist quite often on call in Belfast, of the difficulties that arise when one has to confront the pink forms that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, referred to on another occasion. What he describes are the practicalities of working out the legislation that has been properly put in place. He has not described the principle. He adverted to the principle of care and concern, and to autonomy, understanding and so on. That can be written into a piece of legislation. What could not be written in was the requirement that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, should turn up. That is not something one can put in. That was a piece of practice that was occasioned by understanding and the principled approach. That is where there seems to be some confusion.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0701089000163"></a>For me&#151;perhaps some might think it a rather quaint notion&#151;principles are things that you do not change very often; rather less than once in every  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_32"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>25 years in my view. Principles are the kinds of things that are fundamental, that you stick with, the kinds of things one is perfectly happy to put in a piece of legislation which might last for a generation. Practice is a different matter. That is the sort of thing that may have to change in various circumstances, as has been described to us in this particular anecdote. It may have to change quite regularly and frequently. The principle does not change but how one applies it has to change if the principle itself is to be sustained and maintained. The principle is something transcendent with longevity. So when I turn to the code of practice&#151;it is not a code of principles&#151;and the principles that are in it, I find that it states that the status of the principles is the same as the status of the code as a whole. The principles outlined here are not transcendent but are simply in with all the rest of the stuff in the code&#151;a code of practice, that is, not a code of principles. The whole point of principles is that they stand over and above everything else, and one can judge what happens afterwards on the basis of the fundamental principles. As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, says, a list of principles would have a decisive influence on the way in which the Bill is used. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0701089000164"></a>It has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that staff do not read the legislation that is passed here; they read the codes of practice. I hope that I am not letting myself or my psychiatrist colleagues down when I say that my experience is that we do consult the legislation, and we consult it all the time to make sure that we are absolutely right with it. How reassuring and encouraging it would be if, right at the beginning of the legislation, was a set of principles upon which we could depend for our interpretation of all the complicated and technical details that happen thereafter. At nine or 10 o&#146;clock on a Friday night, when a practitioner is under pressure from other healthcare practitioners, is dealing with a disturbed patient and a family in difficulties, and there are frequently very few beds available even when the decision to take the patient is made, a set of principles at the start that enables the practitioner to think in the right direction is a great protection and relief.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0701089000165"></a>The fact that those principles do not change too frequently is extremely helpful. It means that through your professional life you know where you stand, along with the patient, the carers and those who provide services over a prolonged period. They know the fundamental principles upon which they should base their professional behaviour, their caring commitment and the provision of services, as a health service should do. The idea that principles should be changed every now and again in a code of practice without parliamentary scrutiny seems to be the wrong way round. The principles should survive; they should be included right at the start and should guide Her Majesty's Government and your Lordships&#146; House as we consider the rest of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0701089000166"></a>It is a fundamental principle of our parliamentary process that subsequent Acts can amend previous ones, so if these principles are not in conformity with some parts of the 1983 Act we should expect that Act to be amended because we are talking about

It has been suggested that there is a real problem of compatibility. I have a problem with that, because it means that the code of practice would not be compatible with the 1983 legislation because it sets down the principles. Or does it have some kind of subsidiary statutory position which means that it does not stack up? If so, that strengthens the argument for having the principles in the Bill where nobody can be in any doubt which is primary legislation. The code of practice cannot be primary if the Government are suggesting there is a problem of compatibility.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0701089000167"></a>We have talked about guidance to those who are involved at every level from the passage of the legislation and the provision of services to the operation of the Act and the code of practice. Then there are the notions of longevity&#151;that principles should outlast the current fashion&#151;and of transcendence, with principles above the rest. There is a very good reason why those are important. The Bill is about the problems of disordered and deluded thinking. When I was training, my old trainer warned me against a particular form of disturbed thinking. Furor sanandi, or the madness to heal, is the belief, sometimes found in practitioners&#151;and legislators and providers of services&#151;that they so know the truth of what should be done that they have the right, and indeed the responsibility, to force it on people to make sure that they get better whether they like it or not. The principles will be a protection against furor sanandi.</p>

From the moment we started discussing this very important Bill it was extremely important that we should all agree on the tone and temper of what the importance of this subject represented. I was particularly glad that, on the principle in proposed new paragraph (f), he talked about the need to ensure that, unless justified by the circumstances, the patient is not treated less favourably than a person who is not a patient might be treated in a comparable situation.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0701089000169"></a>We have already drawn attention to two groups who might benefit from this: minority and ethnic communities, and children. There is a third group, which represents an enormous well of psychiatric morbidity in this country, and that is those who are in custody or in the hands of the Prison Service. It is unfortunate that the National Health Service assumed responsibility for mental health, as well as primary healthcare, in prisons only in 2003. Until then no provision for people suffering from mental health problems in prison had been made in the planning of the National Health Service. It is estimated that up to 500 prisoners each year might have needed to be transferred to special mental hospitals, but had to compete with the requirements of people from the community. Very often the prisoner lost out and became worse as a result. That, of course, is a public health issue.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0701089000170"></a>Had this principle been enshrined in the original 1983 Act, and had Prison Service healthcare been

It is important that this should be included in the principles at the start of this Bill because, if included, it tempers our judgment on many of the other issues in the Bill, which we will be discussing during the course of the amendments.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0701089000171"></a>I should like to add one practical point, though not the one mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. It is surely axiomatic that the parliamentary draftsmen should work night and day to get a Bill of such importance absolutely correct&#151;perhaps we should add extra parliamentary draftsmen to the task&#151;rather than that we regard that as something to prevent it happening. My practical point concerns the provision of services to the people who require them as a result of this Act. I shall quote two statistics in support of that. In 1999 when this Government introduced a paper about what they called people suffering from dangerous and severe personality disorder&#151;neither term being recognised by psychiatrists&#151;it was said that there were some 2,500 in the country. Four hundred were in special hospitals receiving the treatment they required; 700 were somewhere in the community, possibly receiving some form of treatment; 1,400 were in our prisons, where nobody knew who they were and they were certainly not receiving treatment. That is one end of the spectrum.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0701089000172"></a>At the other end, it was said by the Office for National Statistics in a report published in October 1998 that 70 per cent of all those in prison are suffering from some form of identifiable personality disorder. That is an enormous well. We must remember that all except some 35 of that huge number will come out and join the community. Therefore, we have a responsibility to use their time in prison to do something to help them lead useful and law-abiding lives when they come out. That is why it is so important that, in any Bill discussing mental health, the needs of those in custody are included so that provision is made for them as a result of that Bill, be that in principle or in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0701089000175"></a>When he comes to respond to this debate, I invite the Minister to confirm that the inclusion of principles in this Bill, and therefore in the amended Mental Health Act 1983, is in order. I understand that it is within the Long Title of the Bill and perfectly in order. Therefore, I hope that we will not hear any more of the purported explanation that it is not possible to introduce principles in this Bill because it amends the Mental Health Act 1983. The constitutional position is irrefutable. It is possible to amend the 1983 Act in this way.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0701089000176"></a>We have heard the argument that it would be difficult for parliamentary draftsmen to draft anything in time to achieve the purpose of the amendment, even if the amendment is imperfect. That is palpable nonsense. I happen to deal a great deal with terrorism legislation, which is a very difficult area. However, most of it is drafted overnight by parliamentary counsel. Several noble Lords in this House are ex-Ministers who have been Cabinet Members or Ministers at a senior level. Ministers frequently instruct parliamentary counsel to draft much more complex legislation than this literally overnight for the next meeting of a Standing Committee. If the amendment is imperfect, it is not far from the mark, and I apprehend that a couple of parliamentary counsel could probably finish it &#147;between lunch and tea&#148;, to coin a phrase.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0701089000177"></a>My next point is a general one about mental health and mental illness. No doubt others in this House have also been in the position of having to face an entry into acute mental health issues concerning those near or dear to us. In my case, it fell far short of compulsory treatment, I am happy to say. For every family and every patient who enters into these issues, it is a very frightening experience. It is like walking into a completely dark cave with, if you are lucky, the slightest suspicion of light at the other side.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0701089000178"></a>The particular problem with mental illness is that many if not most of the people who walk into that cave are highly intelligent. They are capable of understanding the principles surrounding their treatment. They do not all live in a permanent fantasy world. Most of them have long lucid periods in which they understand exactly what is going on. They are aware that they are ill but when they are sectioned they ask the clinicians&#151;such as my noble friend Lord Alderdice, in Belfast&#151;who go to their homes late at night, what their rights are, why they are being detained and what will happen to them. A stark illustration of that was given by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, in his very helpful speech, which put these issues into a human context.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0701089000179"></a>We are talking about intelligent people who must trust the medical services they come into contact with, particularly if those services are compulsory. The dark cave must seem an even gloomier place, if that is possible, when the treatment is compulsory in the sort of circumstances described by the noble Lord, Lord Winston.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0701089000180"></a>Principles in the statute enable the person concerned and those who have his or her best interests at heart to challenge their detention. We talk in this legislation about the liberty of the subject, and of

They are simply severely ill and a threat perhaps to themselves and others.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0701089000181"></a>I recognise that the courts are of course able to take account of codes of practice. Yet the influence of a code of practice upon a court, on a take-account basis, is quite different from the influence upon a court of principles in the statute. For the service user, for professionals applying the service and for the court determining the liberty of the subject, the literal imprimatur of inclusion on the statute is most important.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0701089000182"></a>It may be said that this opens the floodgates of judicial review. That is sometimes said by Governments when they want to avoid putting some principle or other in a Bill. Let us not forget that judicial review requires the permission of the court to proceed to a hearing. In areas such as this, the courts are extremely conscientious to ensure that leave provisions are applied fully.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0701089000183"></a>On the issue of whether practitioners pay attention to the statute and the codes of practice, I agree entirely with my noble friend Lord Alderdice. As a criminal barrister, I have a lot of experience of reading reports by and calling evidence from forensic psychiatrists who speak of the mental state of somebody who has been referred to them. I have seen Sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983 referred to on hundreds of occasions&#151;and parsed in detail by the practitioners on not a few&#151;to determine whether their patient falls within the provisions. It is rare to read in such a medical report or hear in such evidence reference to codes of practice.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0701089000184"></a>A number of considerations persuaded me and the committee that principles should be in the Bill. I want to list a few of these because they are persuasive&#151;indeed, formidable. We were persuaded by the Richardson committee in 1999, chaired by Professor Ginevra Richardson at King&#146;s College, London, which said that principles should be contained in the Bill. We were persuaded by the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, which has already been mentioned. It has principles on its face.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0701089000185"></a>I was at a meeting earlier today&#151;kindly and helpfully arranged by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon&#151;at which a number of psychiatrists were present. The question was asked: if Scotland can have principles, why cannot we, too? The answer frankly astonished in its risibility&#151;if that is the noun to go with the adjective &#147;risible&#148;. We were told that it would work in Scotland because,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000245"></a>&#147;it is a small place, a village&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000186"></a>I do not know what our Scottish friends will make of that&#151;and I can see one or two feisty ones in the Committee now. But I reject it, especially because quite a few people live in Scotland who do not come from the village&#151;who go to Scotland and then, unfortunately, become patients. Having the principles in the Bill would provide exactly the certainty that the Scottish Parliament found when it introduced this legislation.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0701089000187"></a>We were persuaded by the Mental Health Alliance, which proposed that principles should be contained in the Bill. We were persuaded by the Minister of State,

As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, reminded us, in the Government&#146;s response to the committee&#146;s report, she accepted that principles should be included in the Bill. Nothing has changed in reality. I suggest that the burden is firmly on the Government to show beyond any doubt, if they can, why there is now a persuasive and convincing case for principles not to be included in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0701089000188"></a>We were persuaded, too, by the British Psychological Society; No Force UK; the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, which has done an immense amount of research in this area; Depression Alliance Cymru; Mind, of which the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, is the president, as he said earlier; Mencap; the Council on Tribunals, to which I shall come in a moment; Professor Thorneycroft; and Rowena Daw from the Mental Health Alliance. They all,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000246"></a>&#147;emphasised the very powerful and important signal value of having clear and explicit guiding principles on the face of the Bill which set out the ethical standards that apply when a person is deprived of his liberty and autonomy under the Act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000221"></a>There is an absolute paramountcy in producing ethical legislation on this subject, and including principles in the Bill is a prime ethical consideration.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0701089000189"></a>We were persuaded, too, by the Joint Committee on Human Rights which, in its 25th report in November 2002, recommended that principles be clarified in the legislation.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0701089000190"></a>I referred to the Council on Tribunals, whose words are worth reflecting on. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="0701089000237"></a>&#147;Since the Code of Practice will not bind the Mental Health Tribunal, it would greatly assist the Tribunal in carrying out its judicial functions under the Act if a clear statement of the guiding principles were specified in the legislation itself&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70108-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0701089000222"></a>We were persuaded by the Mental Health Act Commission, the Bar Council and, as has already been mentioned, the contents of the Children Act 1989 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005, a close cousin of that legislation, both of which have principles included.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0701089000191"></a>I must say that I am also persuaded by everything that I have heard in the Chamber this afternoon. There is a near unanimity on this issue, and I believe that it would be inexplicable to the community at large if the Minister were not to make at the very least a signal concession. With great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Warner&#151;whom, in welcoming the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, we miss from the Front Bench on this Bill&#151;we do not want a compromise. It is not good enough&#151;we want principles included in the Bill. They may be slightly different from what has been proposed, but that is the commitment that we request, and I suggest that it is a perfectly reasonable request.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="0701089000193"></a>It has been a singularly well informed debate of very high quality. My comments will be quite brief. I have received a flood of letters from professional organisations of every kind stressing the crucial importance of including principles in the Bill. The issue was brilliantly articulated by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I will quote just one piece of the evidence that I have received; it is from the General Medical Council, of which the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, was once a distinguished lay member.</p>

<a name="70108-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0701089000194"></a>The council said that it was very,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000247"></a>&#147;disappointed that principles have not been included on the face of the [Bill] (although they are in the draft Code of Practice)&#148;, particularly as&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000223"></a>the noble Lords, Lord Rix and Lord Carlile, have also said this recently&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000248"></a>&#147;the Government agreed in its response to the report of the Joint Committee on the draft Mental Health Bill 2004, that principles should be set out on the face of the Bill&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000224"></a>The GMC says that, while it welcomes,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000249"></a>&#147;the principles, including respect for patients, non-discrimination, maximum benefit and minimum restrictions, which are set out in the draft Code of Practice, we maintain that clear, meaningful principles should be included on the face of the legislation itself&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0701089000225"></a>It believes that,</p>
<ul><a name="0701089000250"></a>&#147;this would be a valuable way of providing clarity about the scope and purpose of the Bill, so that those working within its framework or affected by its provisions are clear about the basis on which it is considered legitimate to intervene in the lives of people with a mental disorder&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70108-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0701089000195"></a>I could not put that more clearly. The House should support this amendment very strongly.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0701089000197"></a>My first priority in a debate of this type is to ask myself, &#147;Will this be effective?&#148;. At the moment my concern about the proposed list of principles, or anything like it, is that it would be ineffective and in certain circumstances it could be counterproductive. First, as people were half-recognising, some of the things in the list are practices not principles and it would be a job to make them stand up as principles in a court of law. Secondly&#151;this is very important and needs to be taken into account by many on all sides of the legislature&#151;a good code of practice can be much more effective in law at protecting people&#146;s rights than principles in a Bill. There are one or two areas where we could get into severe difficulties, even if this list of principles were taken away to be rewritten.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0701089000198"></a>I would like to give an example, which is my last point but an important one. For many years I have taken the widely supported view that one of the main failings of the British mental health system has been the overrepresentation of certain ethnic-minority groups&#151;most particularly, Afro-Caribbeans and Africans&#151;among those receiving psychiatric treatment. That is mirrored by the singular lack of doctors and other people in key positions who are drawn from those communities. Yet we see in this list an attempt to put that into a principle, which it might

When I last checked, there were at least 170 or 180 languages spoken in London alone; I think there are well over 200 now. Many of those are spoken only by a small number of people. It is not just that if you had such principles in the Bill you would have to produce psychiatrists who spoke the language; you would also be expecting nurses or others in a hospital situation to deal with an individual, knowing that the principles of the Bill stated that they must take account of their language and treat them equally, even when they were unable to communicate effectively with them. Certainly, in many, many cases, they would not be able to get an interpreter or another person to speak that person&#146;s language.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0701089000199"></a>If you list the principles, you have to be 100 per cent sure, and I mean 100 per cent sure&#151;I say that particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, with his legal experience&#151;that you can realistically deliver on them. If you cannot do so, it is not a matter of opening the floodgates to legal cases; it is that you have failed to be effective. In legislation such as this, we are trying to be effective. Either the list of principles must be very tightly drawn up and very well defined or you go down the road of a code of practice. If the Minister is minded to take up my noble friend Lord Warner&#146;s suggestion, I ask him to come back to the House with some indication of how we, much more effectively than in the past, can address the racial imbalance in the British mental health system. It is profoundly serious and very significant, but it will not, in my judgment, be dealt with by putting a principle on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0701089000200"></a>This is about training, practice and a requirement for how health authorities and the various professionals and groups involved address the problem. Although one or two people have dismissed it, the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord Warner that the Government look at this again and come back to it is a good one. I do not see why the Government should have difficulty with the general principle, if you like, about what should be in the list of principles. There is every question about how effectively you will deliver on them. If you are going to go down that road, you have to be very clear about the principles; they must be very clearly spelled out, very brief and very easily interpreted by a court of law; otherwise, you will end up being totally ineffective on something that people feel quite strongly about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0701089000202"></a>In his opening remarks, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to stigma and discrimination. We live with those still; they still abound around us. Certainly, I come across quite a lot of stigma surrounding  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_40"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mental health issues. In fact, I was coming across so much stigma last year, and it was so serious, that I arranged to have a roadshow come to my diocese, with people who could talk about mental health educatively. We had a very worthwhile session. To my great surprise, it was well received and people have asked for more. We have so much still to do on discrimination and stigma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0701089000203"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, referred to the fact that we have a great opportunity now to make this Bill even better than it is. Amendment No. 1 is the way in to doing just that. We need to seize the opportunity. The principles are: maximising the participation of the patient, taking proper account of the views of patients and carers, non-discriminatory treatment, reciprocity and having the least restrictive treatment. We believe that those principles should be in the Bill, and it is difficult to see any of them being nullified or superseded. I hope to hear the newly returned Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, give us all some encouragement. Allowing for the cautions of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, I say let us give the parliamentary draftsmen even more work to do on wet winter afternoons. Others on the Benches opposite have made similar comments. As the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, pointed out, guiding principles also have a significant professional and public educative role. We support the amendment wholeheartedly.</p>

He and I, like several others in this House, go back a long way. Like my noble friend Lord Carlile, I very much hope that he will not disappoint on this occasion. He does not usually.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0701089000205"></a>I should declare some interests. I am an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which has been much quoted this afternoon. I was chief executive of the King&#146;s Fund, a member of the Mental Health Alliance, which has been writing to members of your Lordships&#146; House regularly over the past few months and, indeed, years. I am also an adviser to the trustees of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, which, too, has been much quoted this afternoon. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, I believe that the Mental Health Alliance is one of the great things to have happened in this third time round with the mental health legislation. The Mental Health Alliance&#151;an alliance of some rather unlikely bedfellows&#151;got together seven years ago and has become truly a force for good; it is a good forum in which strong, powerful and intelligent thought is given to these issues and great debates are held.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0701089000206"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, I think that the question to the Minister is: &#147;Why not put this on the face of the Bill?&#148;. Part of the mental health legislation is so compulsorily restrictive that the principles by which the state, if you like, takes unto itself the ability to restrict the freedoms of various often very vulnerable members of society should be clearly stated where everyone can see them and is likely to see them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="0701089000207"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Walton, I have received an enormous number of letters, as I am sure we all have, from a whole variety of organisations. But perhaps the most extraordinary thing has been not the enormous number of those letters, which I think we might have expected, but the number of letters that many of us have had from complete strangers&#151;not people whom we already know&#151;asking us to take this aspect very seriously. They want principles that service users or patients can see and understand to be put on the face of the Bill. They are saying that not because they are theoretically interested, but because they are the parents, siblings or children of people who have severe mental illness episodically; they know that it is important for those people to see what the principles are and to test the way in which they are treated against those principles. Like the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, I think that we should take this matter extremely seriously. I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will accept the amendment, even if he takes it away to have a think about it and comes back with a marginally different version.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0701089000208"></a>Let me deal with the doubt about whether principles should be included on the face of a Bill because they change. Yes, we change. Human beings view things in different ways over a quarter of a century&#151;and it is roughly every quarter of a century that we have a look at mental health legislation. Our perceptions change. However, as my noble friend Lady Barker said, if they change, we have a chance to debate the issues in this House. Homosexuality is a good example. I suspect that in the next few years we will change our perceptions&#151;to the good, I hope&#151;on the issues that are being raised now about the treatment of black and minority ethnic communities in our mental health services. And, yes, we will use this principle to drive our perceptions further. You can say that perceptions may change and that we may have to debate things again, but that does not invalidate putting principles on the face of a Bill. You derive everything else from those principles. As we examine the rest of this legislation closely over the next few weeks and months, we need to do so through the net of the principles that I hope will be established.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0701089000209"></a>The issues raised in the principles in the amendment are important. For example, the welfare of the child is paramount in them. That is key, but it is not to be found in the principles in the code of practice that the Government have provided, on the basis, I think, that the treatment of children and young people is separate from the treatment of adults under this legislation. Any of us who have had any experience of mental health services&#151;I once chaired a mental health trust&#151;know that there are borderlines here. Young people of 16 and 17 years of age often find themselves in adult wards being treated by people who are not expert child and adolescent mental health service professionals but normally work with adults. If we do not have a principle in the Bill about the treatment of children, I believe that people will not take the welfare of children seriously. I consider that to be a key issue in our present mental

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0701089000210"></a>Secondly, there is the question of reciprocity, which also is not mentioned in the code of practice. When the state deprives people of their freedom, it must do something in return. One would expect high-quality treatment, care and protection, and the idea of reciprocity not appearing in the Bill worries me.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0701089000211"></a>I also want to talk about Scotland. Those whom I have talked to working in the mental health services in Scotland say that thus far the Scottish legislation seems to be working quite well. It seems extraordinary that we do not learn from that and say that, if that is the case and if principles appear in the Scottish legislation, perhaps we should also have principles in our legislation. I want to quote a Scottish service user:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0701089000238"></a>&#147;The principles ... make crystal clear the need to respect us and treat us as fellow humans deserving of dignity and respect, entitled to participate and have a say in what happens to us at all points in our treatment ... Nowadays, I see my psychiatrist as someone I trust rather than fear or feel suspicious of; in the past, I felt the opposite&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70108-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="0701089000212"></a>However, the key reason that it is important that the Minister accepts the amendment is that, as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, pointed out, the Government accepted that principles should be in the 2004 draft Bill. Therefore, having accepted that in principle, it should be possible to deal with the practical objections raised by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and others. If we cannot deal with practical difficulties, I do not think much of us as legislators.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="0701089000213"></a>The Government claim that it would be difficult to graft principles on to the existing Act but, despite everything that we have heard this afternoon, I cannot see why that should be so. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, said that it would be difficult for the parliamentary draftsmen, but&#151;dare I say it as someone who is related to an odd lawyer or two?&#151;they are lawyers and they should be able to deal with it. Not only that but, if they cannot do it in a single wet afternoon&#151;although my noble friend Lord Carlile thinks that they could do it between lunch and tea&#151;perhaps there should be several wet afternoons, or weeks or months of wet afternoons, until they can do it. It seems to me that that objection simply does not stand. We have to carry on looking at the issue until we can get it right.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="0701089000214"></a>People from all round the Chamber have said that they want to see principles in the Bill. They have been saying that for a variety of reasons, heartfelt and passionately. They want to see them because they would set some ethical standards, and arguably raise ethical standards, in our treatment of vulnerable people with mental illness. They would give guidance and confidence to tribunals and lawyers and would guide practitioners. As someone who used to chair a mental health trust, I know that psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses look at the legislation and not only at the code of practice. I have frequently seen them do it: they do it when they are in doubt or when they think that the code of practice might be going out of date or might not be entirely adequate.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_43"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 43</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70108-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07010815000001"></a>The principles would also give enormous confidence to people who think that they might be subject to the Bill and who are worried that it might in some way be used against them. It would generally give confidence to service users, as one service user has said of the Scottish Act. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is right to say that the principles would provide clarity and transparency of mental health services for all concerned about when and for whom compulsion is required and when it is not appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07010815000002"></a>As my noble friend Lord Carlile has said, the expert committee, chaired by Genevra Richardson, wanted it. It said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07010815000057"></a>&#147;legislation is most effective when it reflects the values and ethics of those concerned with its implementation and thereby attracts their agreement and co-operation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010815000053"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has argued that the European Convention on Human Rights is called into play here and that the absence of principles in the Bill would leave the legislation open to legal challenges. The Joint Committee on the Bill said that placing them in a code of practice that can be overridden in emergencies is not sufficient. The Mental Health Act commissioner, Chinyere Inyama, has argued that the absence of the principles in the current Act led to drift. Perhaps that is why there have been so many challenges under the Human Rights Act 1998. As many others around the Committee have said, principles are included in the Children Act, the Adoption Act, the Mental Capacity Act and, of course, the Scottish mental health Act, so why not here?</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07010815000003"></a>The Government have said that principles restating rights and duties in other legislation should not necessarily appear on the face of the Bill. That must be wrong, because how can it be right for the Adoption (Scotland) Act but not right here? The principles should be stated and cross-referenced. Given the nature of the legislation, they need to be seen.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07010815000004"></a>First and foremost, I am a rabbi so I shall make a rabbinic point. The principles are a little like the 10 Commandments: one does not need to keep repeating them. It is not that people do not know them&#151;they do&#151;but they are principles and the rest can be derived from them, so one puts them in to remind people. The principles need to be right at the beginning of the Bill as an aide memoire, to give moral authority, which I believe people need in this kind of legislation.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07010815000005"></a>I have a couple of points to make on individual principles. Clearly, the issue of participation is obvious. From all around the Committee, we have heard that people want greater participation by people who have mental illnesses and who often have them episodically. That needs to be strengthened in the code of practice. The issue of carers is relatively new as regards quarter-century reviews of mental health legislation. In the evidence submitted to us before today's debate, it was very clear that the views of carers need to be taken into consideration much  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_44"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more. The national confidential inquiry into suicides and homicides emphasised that the consultation on working with carers was a key part of working differently with people who have mental illness. The expert committee said the same.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07010815000006"></a>On patients' wishes, the principles in the code of practice simply do not go far enough. They do not encapsulate paragraph (c) of the amendment, the paragraph for which the noble Lord, Lord Warner, did not care:</p>
<ul><a name="07010815000058"></a>&#147;the present and past wishes and feelings of the patient which are relevant to the discharge of the function&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010815000054"></a>He argues that that principle is not one that is easy to translate into a set of principles in the Bill. I beg to disagree with him. Of course, it is a principle in the Mental Capacity Act and, therefore, translates very neatly into this Bill. I argue that it is very important to take patients&#146; wishes into account.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07010815000007"></a>On race, equality and diversity, the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, made a strong case. <I>Breaking the Circles of Fear</I>, published by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, made absolutely clear how terrified of the services many black patients are. That is exacerbated by the fact that, increasingly, some of the mental health professionals become frightened of patients from the black and minority ethnic communities. That exacerbates the fear, and the process goes round in circles. The evidence is clear that the incidence of black patients&#151;particularly men&#151;being detained under the Mental Health Act is between 25 and 38 per cent greater than among other groups. Non-discrimination must therefore be in the Bill to give those communities confidence. Assuming that practitioners will remember non-discrimination and take it into account, day after day in a busy practice, without it being in the Bill is at least unwise and arguably unsafe.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07010815000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is of course right to say that prisoners are the third special category, along with children and people from minority ethnic communities. He is right because such an enormous proportion of the prison population has either a mental illness or personality disorder or both. Again, principle (f), which makes it clear that they can have treatment no less favourable than any other patient, is absolutely vital.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07010815000009"></a>I hope that the Government will listen to everything said around the Committee. One thing that has worried me particularly, however, is the omission of the disability framework from the principles. The Disability Rights Commission has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07010815000056"></a>&#147;In relation to non-discrimination principles, we believe it is not merely desirable but necessary to restate and reinforce key principles which feature in other legislation. The existing public sector duties to promote disability and race equality, for example, need practical reinforcement in a legislative framework in which people may be deprived of their liberty and where prejudicial and discriminatory judgments can so easily come into play. Including principles which support the autonomy and human rights of mental health patients, we believe, would be an effective way of the Department of Health being able to demonstrate that it is meeting its duty to promote disability equality under Section 49 of the Disability Discrimination Act&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010815000055"></a>That case is made. There must be a statement of principles including disability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07010815000010"></a>I remind the Minister of the NHS Plan which came into force about five and a half years ago. There was a statement of principles right at the beginning of <I>NHS Plan: a Plan for Investment, a Plan for Reform</I>&#151;a sort of Ten Commandments, dare I say it, for the NHS&#151;which had massive sign-up from all around the NHS: patient groups, royal colleges and all sorts of advisory groups. It gave the NHS Plan the feeling that people really wanted to make it work. The same must be true here. If we can get the sign-up, with principles that everybody has agreed are the right way forward, it will be much easier to make the legislation work.</p>

<a name="70108-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07010815000011"></a>The final argument was made by my noble friend Lady Barker. It is about making patients feel safer. Possible service users and present patients would feel safer if principles enshrining their protection were actually in the Bill. That is important for them, but it is just as important for public safety. They are much more likely to then seek help than if they feel that the principles are in a code of practice that could be overridden. If they do not feel safe, and that they might be subject to compulsion when they do not feel it is right, they will not seek help. If people who need help do not seek it, we are in trouble.</p>

I was not planning to speak to this amendment, although I completely agree with all the comments that have been made. I feel I have to speak briefly in direct response to what the noble Lord, Lord Soley, said. I hope that I heard his comments incorrectly and that there was no suggestion that we might justify an inferior quality of care&#151;or what I would probably state to be an illegal service&#151;to somebody whose first language was not English. We have come across too many of those situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07010815000013"></a>The language issue is a very good example of why paragraph (g) of Amendment No. 1 is absolutely perfect, because it stops practitioners from turning a blind eye to someone who is a difficult patient. It goes beyond that. Where there are issues of sexual orientation, it draws to the attention of the practitioner, the RMO, that something needs to be done. It is really important that we deal with such issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07010815000016"></a>I have a certain amount of form in this area as on 20 December 2000 I made a statement on behalf of the Government about our plans for this legislation. Since then, there have been two draft Bills and much discussion and development of ideas. I am glad that we are now in a position to move forward. At the time of that statement in 2000, I said that good quality care and treatment is the key to making sure that  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_46"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>most people with mental health problems never need fall within the scope of mental health legislation and I talked about the Government&#146;s plans for improving services. One can never be complacent, but I am glad to say that since then there has been improved access to effective treatment and care, standards have been raised, and services are quicker and more convenient. Of course, there is still much more to be done.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07010815000017"></a>It also has to be recognised that however much we do to improve services, there will always be a need for mental health legislation to protect a person with serious mental health problems from harming themselves or others. We are seeking to update that legislation, not only to ensure it meets the objective of protection, but to make sure that the legislation is in line with modern service provision and promotes patient safeguards.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07010815000018"></a>I will respond to the telling comments made about ethical standards. Of course detention in hospital and compulsory treatment raises difficult ethical issues; it is right that we debate those fully. We must make sure that we get this legislation right. We should also accept that patients will rarely be happy about being brought under compulsion, and we have an opportunity here to ensure that when compulsion is used it is done in ways that best serve the needs of patients and provide for the proper safeguarding of their rights. We are committed to providing good quality and accessible services and we will continue to encourage patients to seek help where they believe they need it. Despite this, there will always be occasions when compulsion will be needed&#151;a fact we believe our community, including the users of mental health services, acknowledges.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07010815000019"></a>Clearly, I am new to this debate and noble Lords who have spoken are very experienced and expert in this field. I just want to assure them that I see my role as listening to the debates in Committee. I want to find as constructive a way forward as possible and will do everything that I can to make sure that that happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07010815000020"></a>Noble Lords were very kind to me and then suggested that I could confirm the view they have of me by accepting Amendment No. 1. Alas, not for the first time, I shall disappoint. However, I have listened carefully to the debate and have a sense of where noble Lords are coming from. I also understand full well the importance of ethical standards and fully understand that a principled approach to the implementation of mental health legislation is vital. However, the Government see some practical difficulties in accepting the amendment as it stands or accepting it with minor modifications. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that putting the principles in the Bill is not a constitutional problem, rather we are concerned about the practical impact of those principles. We consider that the right and best way to approach the principles is to apply them in the codes of practice. I say to my noble friend Lord Bragg that this approach is not defensive and technical, but is concerned to make the legislation as clear as possible. Putting the principles in the Bill might well lead to a lack of clarity and a lack of understanding by practitioners who have to operate day in and day out.  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_47"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07010815000021"></a>Noble Lords, and many people outside this House, have referred to the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 as a good example of principles in an Act. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, reminded us about the recommendations of his committee and I pay tribute to the work that he and other members of that committee undertook. It is certainly the case that in the Government&#146;s response to the committee&#146;s report we agreed that principles should be in the Bill as long as they could be drafted in a way that allowed for due protection of an individual&#146;s rights and autonomy while also facilitating practitioners and others to take decisions to minimise harm. But there is a difference between then and now: the Scottish Act and the draft 2004 Bill were replacement legislation, but the Bill before us is not. It is an amending Bill in response to many comments received from stakeholders. It amends a well established and legally tested Act of Parliament&#151;the 1983 Act&#151;which embodies a finely balanced system matching individual rights against the need to take action to prevent harm.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07010815000022"></a>The 1983 Act already contains overriding principles, albeit that they are inherent in its provisions and not separately spelled out. None the less, they are there, and I shall attempt to summarise them. First, the common law protects the personal freedom of the individual, which may not be curtailed except in circumstances sanctioned by law. Secondly, the law may provide for the compulsory detention in hospital of those who suffer from mental disorder when it is necessary for their protection or that of others&#151;which is what the Mental Health Act primarily does. Thirdly, compulsory interventions must be for clinical reasons. Fourthly, compulsory interventions must be justified in all the circumstances&#151;to give the most obvious example, detention for treatment under Section 3 is permissible only when other ways ensuring patients get the treatment they need would not suffice. Fifthly, in order to determine that compulsory interventions are justified in the terms of the Act, other options have to be considered. Sixthly, the detained person has the right to have the lawfulness of his detention reviewed by an independent judicial body that has the power to discharge him if it finds his detention is unlawful. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and to other noble Lords that our concern is not so much about a conflict between those principles and those in the amendment, or about the time of parliamentary counsel; our concern is that grafting new principles on to such an established and tested piece of legislation does not offer the clarity that proponents of this amendment are seeking.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07010815000023"></a>Of course, practitioners need guidance on how to operate the Act, and we agree that guidance should include explicit principles to which they should have regard. That is why principles are contained in the current code of practice for England and Wales and why we propose to revise and extend them in the illustrative revised code that we have issued alongside the Bill. Like the 10 principles proposed in this amendment, people are required to have regard to the code, including its principles, which means that, as the  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_48"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>courts have stated, they can depart from them only if they have cogent reasons, and they may be called on to justify their reasons if they do so.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07010815000024"></a>The difference between having the principles in the code and having them in the Act is the clarity of their relationship with the detailed provisions of the Act. If the principles are in the code, it is clear that the statute comes first. The principles do not change the statute, but guide people on how to approach its implementation. If the principles are in the Act, they must be assumed to have an effect equal in status and therefore somehow add to the existing detailed provisions, which would, I suggest, make interpretation much more complex.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07010815000025"></a>Let me give examples of some of the issues that would be problematic. My noble friends Lord Warner and Lord Soley referred to some of them. If we take the amendment introducing a principle of maximising the benefit to the patient from the discharge of the functions, at the level of generality, no one would disagree. However, its very purpose means that the Act needs to strike a balance between the needs of individuals and the rights of others to be protected from the risks posed by their mental disorders. That balance is inherent in the legislation as it stands, and putting this principle in the Act, especially with no counter-balancing provision about assessment of risk or harm to others, might have to be presumed to change that balance somehow.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07010815000026"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Neuberger, raised the issue of the reciprocal right. The reciprocal right to treatment and support principle introduces a further obligation to anticipate health outcomes. It seems to us that the effect would be to restore many of the disadvantages of the so-called treatability test, to which we will be coming in due course. There are many cases in which it is entirely right that a detained patient should be treated in a comparable way to a non-detained patient. The fact of detention should not, for example, make any difference to the quality of healthcare received, nor should the patient be treated with any less consideration or respect. But we must think about what the principle would mean when applied to, for example, the criteria for detention. The criteria are in the Act and are the justification for treating the patient differently. We could debate whether that is less favourable treatment, and I can imagine that many people might think that it is. It is certainly true that it inevitably prevents patients doing certain things and making certain choices that other people would be able to make if they were admitted to hospital voluntarily. Yet this principle, which noble Lords would have as part of the Act itself, relates to treatment that can be justified in the circumstances, so it appears to call for justification over and above the criteria that already determine when an application for detention can be made. Yet it is not clear what the justification would be or why there should need to be any further justification. If noble Lords feel that the criteria should be changed, the way to do it is to propose amendments to the criteria and not to create uncertainty by putting principles in the Act whose relationship to the criteria is unclear.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_49"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70108-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07010815000027"></a>The very purpose of the Act is to provide a lawful framework for the application of compulsion where it is necessary for the prevention of harm. It is to enable patients to be treated under constraints which would be unnecessary were it not for the risks of harm posed by their disorder. To put this principle in the Act risks frustrating that purpose.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07010815000028"></a>Likewise, while consulting carers is a good thing&#151;subject to the specific circumstances of the case&#151;the effect of making it a principle in the Act would not merely be to make it explicit. Decisions often have to be taken in circumstances where consultation with carers may not be practical; for example, where emergency treatment is required. Does making it a principle in the Bill mean, for example, that taking account of carers&#146; views would become, in effect, an additional criterion for such treatment, beyond the fact that treatment is immediately necessary to save the patient&#146;s life or one of the other purposes set out in Section 62? If so, it is hard to see how that would be desirable. Overall, this principle would seem to risk placing a disproportionate burden on practitioners that could even be to a patient&#146;s detriment.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07010815000029"></a>As noble friends have said, the proposed principles also have the potential to conflict with each other. There are circumstances where it may be inappropriate for some reason to consult carers, perhaps because of the views of patients, which would have to be taken into account under the previous proposed principle in the amendment.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07010815000030"></a>Similarly, the maximum benefit principle and the least restriction duty may conflict. Compulsory treatment may speed up a patient&#146;s recovery but involve more restriction than could perhaps be said to be necessary if the risk posed by the patient&#146;s disorder could, in theory, be managed equally well by detaining the patient for a long time with only the minimum care and treatment. Yet, in that case, the amendment would seem to suggest that least restriction must be preferred, because unless the action needed to provide maximum benefit were &#147;necessary&#148; rather than, let us say, highly desirable, the least restriction duty would trump the maximum benefit principle.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07010815000031"></a>The Act is, in large part, about clinical and professional judgments. By its very nature, it has to be so. The presumptions of circumstances for which this legislation must cater are surely too varied to be amenable to primary legislation. There is surely an argument for leaving practitioners with sufficient discretion to deploy their professional judgment proportionately with the patient&#146;s needs and the assessed risk in every case, not tie them down with over-prescriptive legislative requirements.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07010815000032"></a>I have listened carefully to noble Lords&#146; passionate speeches. Their intention seems clearly to be to ensure that practitioners, as well as patients and the public, understand and have access to a clearly defined set of principles to promote best practice, and no one could argue against it. However, that is the beauty of the code of practice. Noble Lords have rather dismissed the benefit of flexibility. Twenty five years has been quoted as the average amount of time between  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_50"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>different mental health Bills. Circumstances change. Even if we were to adopt principles which, it seemed to us, as the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, suggested, would last many lifetimes, none of us could say with confidence that we could establish all those principles today. Life and society move on. That is the beauty of the code of practice. My understanding is that it has been changed from time to time. There is ample opportunity for scrutiny by Parliament of the code of practice.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07010815000033"></a>Various comments were made about various aspects of the code of practice. I very much accept the point about disability rights. We have produced an illustrative code of practice. The very point of producing this code of practice for discussion and consultation is to be informed by what is in it. If, in the course of time, the code of practice proves to be missing something, and if, as the Act is implemented, it becomes clear that something needs to be added, one can make changes as quickly as possible. However, who of us who have listened to the endless debates on mental health legislation would have confidence that we could simply and quickly change the primary legislation? I urge noble Lords to consider strongly the benefits of an approach through the code of practice, subject to what will be extensive consultation and informed by the debates in your Lordships' House on this Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07010815000034"></a>Few noble Lords mentioned Amendment No. 59, but I ought perhaps to say a few words on it before summing up. It would apply principles proposed for the Mental Health Act 1983 by Amendment No. 1 to all decisions and actions taken under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The amendment was proposed to illustrate that principles were contained in the Mental Capacity Act. I understand that, but I hope that I have explained that we see a difference between a Bill which seeks to amend an existing Act and the circumstances of the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07010815000035"></a>If Amendment No. 59 were agreed to, there would be a great problem in dealing with the two sets of principles as set out in the amendments. People who lack capacity to make their own decisions, whether it be in the context of their personal welfare, property or affairs, or of the new Bournewood safeguards to be established by this Bill, should be fully supported to participate in decision-making about their care. Similarly, no one would argue against the fact that a person&#146;s present and past wishes and feelings should be considered if decisions must be made on their behalf; that the views of those, such as carers, with an interest in the person&#146;s welfare should be taken into account; or that there should be no discrimination. However, Sections 1 to 4 of the Mental Capacity Act already establish these principles. I am not sure how it helps to add the further 10 principles, designed for a different purpose; it would simply confuse.</p>

He began by saying that such principles

However, he has since said that he does not accept the principles, although I noticed that he said nothing about the discrimination principle. He seems to oppose all the others, so that they will not be in a code of practice. His logic is that he does not like them.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07010815000037"></a>The second part of the question is perhaps more important&#151;we shall come to it as the Minister said. Is not the stance of the Government on the matter of putting highly valuable principles on the face of the Bill really based on the new treatment principle, with the highly subjective test of appropriate treatment, instead of a straightforward, objective test which it would be much better for patients and those who want the Act&#146;s protection to have?</p>

Indeed, I invite the noble Lord to read page 8 of the draft illustrative code of practice, which contains the Government&#146;s suggested guiding principles. I have been suggesting that there may be&#151;and, indeed, I believe there will be&#151;some very practical issues with putting the principles on the face of the Bill as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and others have suggested, and with how they interrelate with the current 1983 Act and the principles contained in it. I went on to describe some of the potential difficulties because, although one could certainly argue that each of the principles contained in the amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, could be justified, from time to time there could be a conflict between them in terms of how the Act would have to be implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07010815000039"></a>In terms of where we are and where we should be going, let me say this in conclusion. I have listened very carefully to noble Lords&#146; comments and understand the importance of principles to them. I hope that I have explained why the Government have concerns about the practical impact of the principles proposed, but I will, to use the words of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, take this away and explore it before Report to see whether any movement can be made. I can make no promise that ultimately such an approach will lead us to wish to put some principles on the face of the Bill, but I am happy to take this away and discuss it with noble Lords between Committee and Report to see whether there is any way through.</p>

I thank all noble Lords who have participated in it and thank the Minister for his very full and thoughtful reply. We start from a point that is quite unusual when we debate legislation. There is near universal agreement outside this House, as evidenced by the list read out by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that there should be a set of principles on the face of the Bill. We have heard this afternoon that there is very wide agreement within this House that that should happen. The noble Baroness,

Are the arguments advanced by the Minister strong enough to cause us to think again?</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07010815000041"></a>We have heard from many noble Lords that principles have real practical value. We can see that already in Scotland. I was interested that the Highland Users Group in Scotland has said in a recent broadcast how useful it is to have principles in the Act in giving them confidence in how the legislation will be implemented. That is particularly important because psychiatry is the only branch of medicine feared by its patients and the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, got that point absolutely right. He and the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, were right to say that part of the point of a set of principles is to raise ethical standards of practice. Because they are in the statute, a sound set of principles should have a lasting value over the long term. I took note particularly of what the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said; namely, that the justification for principles is that people will have confidence in the safety of the decisions made.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07010815000042"></a>There seems one particular weakness in a code of practice. A code can be departed from as a result of a House of Lords judgment or case law. That can occur in a whole class of cases so long as there is a cogent set of reasons for doing so, and I have an example in my file. By contrast, guiding principles are of such general applicability that it is hard to see which of them could possibly be incompatible with the detail of the law. Sadly we have to remember that there is a long and ignoble international history of abusing detention in mental hospitals.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07010815000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was right that circumstances change, but if principles are to be changed in response to those circumstances, as we might envisage, it is essential that this only follow parliamentary debate and decision. The fact is that practitioners pay more attention to the Act than the code; that is also true of the Mental Health Review Tribunal and the courts. Over 25 years the Bill will lead to the detention and forced treatment of at least 1 million people, and ensuring that the provisions of the Act are in line with the principles would be time very well spent.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07010815000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, pointed to a possible conflict between some provisions in the amendment. I think that the principles, by their nature, involve a balance between them at different times and in different circumstances. That is exactly what occurs in the implementation of all human rights law, when we think about it. The human right to life, for instance, and the right to liberty. There are circumstances when those two are in conflict. That is the nature of the implementation of this kind of law.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07010815000045"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Warner, was critical of the amendment and commended to our attention the principles set out in the code of practice as an alternative. I would just say to him that the amendment is actually modelled very closely on the wording of the Scottish Act of 2003. It was because I did not want to fall into the trap of importing practical detail on to the face of the Bill that I did not do a straight crib of the code of practice. The noble

The code of practice is primarily that, rather than a set of guiding principles.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07010815000046"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, made the excellent point that the principles in the amendment have been around for a very long time and have gained wide acceptance; however, I am more than happy to concede that the amendment may not be perfect. I should just say that there is a misprint in the last line of the amendment. It should say &#147;informal&#148; care and treatment.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07010815000047"></a>If the principles are not compatible with anything in the Act, surely we ought to try to identify what those issues are. I think we will come to a number of them later in our Committee proceedings, but I say to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that it should not be beyond the wit of parliamentary counsel to propose a set of principles along the lines of those set out in the amendment.</p>

<a name="70108-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07010815000048"></a>There is, of course, a larger point. If it is the united will of this House, supported, we may be entitled to hope, by the Minister&#151;at least in principle&#151;that such a clause be drafted, then a way should be found for that to happen. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said that we must be bold, and I fully agree with him. He is absolutely right. I urge the Government to be bold, to use this opportunity to put the legislation into a context of values and, in so doing, make a real difference to mental health patients. If the Minister commits himself to that, he can count on the support of noble Lords on all sides of the House as he sets about the task.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07010816000004"></a>This is a probing amendment, and I acknowledge the briefing and support I have had from the National Autistic Society. It is widely acknowledged that autistic spectrum disorders are not a form of mental illness. The definitions of mental disorder in the 1983 Act and the Bill include autistic spectrum disorders as covered by the new wider definition. The need for a new definition is understandable, but there is concern that the breadth of the definition in the Bill could result in a greater number of people with an autistic spectrum disorder being inappropriately detained.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07010816000005"></a>At Second Reading, several Peers raised the issue of the broadened definition and the related issue of removing the treatability test, which will be subject to  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_54"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>further debate later in Committee. It was encouraging to hear the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester and my noble friend Lord Bragg speak out about the definition of mental disorder and suggest that exclusions should perhaps be extended.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07010816000006"></a>The reason for the amendment is quite straightforward. It addresses a concern that relates to both those points. The Bill partially excludes people with learning disability from the Act; they can be detained only if they have a mental illness or if,</p>
<ul><a name="07010816000075"></a>&#147;abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010816000067"></a>conduct is displayed, as in the 1983 Act. The caveat is welcome, but the Government have chosen to omit autistic spectrum disorders from this category. The amendment would simply add autistic spectrum disorders to this category, ensuring that people with an autistic spectrum disorder are subject to the same caveat in the Bill as people with a learning disability.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07010816000007"></a>Autistic spectrum disorders are not mental health problems and not psychotic conditions, so mental health legislation should not normally be used to detain people with such a disorder. People with an autistic spectrum disorder experience difficulties with communication, social interaction and flexibility of thought, all of which affect the way in which a person relates to other people and the world around them. It means that people with an autistic spectrum disorder may have difficulty understanding tone of voice or unclear language and may appear withdrawn or insensitive to the feelings of others.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07010816000008"></a>The broadened definition, along with the removed treatability clause, allows for detention if it is necessary for the health or safety of the person or other people. There is concern that that could result in the detention of people with an autistic spectrum disorder where their own or another person&#146;s health or safety is at risk but where detention is unnecessary or inappropriate. For example, a person&#146;s perception of the world as chaotic and confusing can mean that they rely on routine and structure, and on repetitive actions. Unexpected changes to routine can cause alarm and frustration and can sometimes lead to challenging behaviour. Difficulties can arise from sensory sensitivity or social misunderstanding. Another example is a lack of recognition of something as simple as road safety, resulting in people with an autistic spectrum disorder putting themselves at risk. These examples do not justify detention under the Mental Health Act, but the Bill appears to leave that possibility open. The caveat of,</p>
<ul><a name="07010816000076"></a>&#147;abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010816000068"></a>would guard against such inappropriate detentions.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07010816000009"></a>There are concerns that people sometimes remain detained in inappropriate non-specialist placements simply because the support that they need to live in the community or a social care placement is not in place, and that the mental health system is sometimes the only way that some people with an autistic spectrum disorder can access services at all.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07010816000010"></a>The amendment follows a recommendation by the Joint Scrutiny Committee on the 2004 draft Bill. I pay tribute to the committee&#146;s valuable work. It said that  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_55"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people with learning disabilities or communicative disorders such as autistic spectrum disorders should be,</p>
<ul><a name="07010816000077"></a>&#147;liable for compulsory treatment under the Bill only if they display seriously aggressive or severely irresponsible behaviour&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010816000069"></a>At the time, the Government did not agree that this provision from the 1983 Act should be retained. Now, however, the Bill retains that provision, but for people with a learning disability only. Can my noble friend explain why the provision should not be extended to people with an autistic spectrum disorder, as the committee recommended, or in what circumstances someone with an autistic spectrum disorder should be compulsorily detained if they are not mentally ill or do not exhibit abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct?</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07010816000011"></a>At Second Reading, my noble friend Lord Warner&#151;it is great to see him here today&#151;restated the Government&#146;s reasoning. He said that under the new definition,</p>
<ul><a name="07010816000078"></a>&#147;a patient&#146;s needs and risks, not the label that happens to be applied to a person&#146;s mental disorder, determine when action is taken&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/11/06; col. 657.]</ul>
<p><a name="07010816000070"></a>I accept that the amendment refers to a diagnostic label, but it also takes account of risk in a clear way by applying the,</p>
<ul><a name="07010816000079"></a>&#147;abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010816000071"></a>caveat.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07010816000012"></a>Furthermore, with regard to specialist care, a diagnosis should serve as a signpost to appropriate services. Whether or not a person with an autistic spectrum disorder has a mental illness or a learning disability, where care is required it must, ideally, be specialist care. The draft illustrative code of conduct contains a welcome emphasis on the need for specialists with regard to assessments and services, but it could be stronger. I welcome wholeheartedly the Minister&#146;s indication of a willingness to look at strengthening the code. People with an autistic spectrum disorder should be dealt with only in a setting where they can access specialist care. There have been cases without specialist input where mental health problems have been neglected during an assessment and put down to a person&#146;s autistic spectrum disorder. Equally, it is inappropriate for people with an autistic spectrum disorder to be treated for mental health difficulties without any consideration of their autistic spectrum disorder. For example, people are more likely to experience anxiety as a result of their environment; treating the anxiety without understanding its causes may escalate the problem.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07010816000013"></a>The Government have said that they want to reduce the need for compulsion. Stakeholders and Peers on all Benches want to minimise the potential for inappropriate detention. According to the draft illustrative code of practice for the Bill, detention of people solely on account of their autistic spectrum disorder will happen only very rarely. Additions to the draft code about autistic spectrum disorders are extremely welcome, including noting that certain characteristics do not justify the use of the Act. The Bill and the draft code could do more to prevent  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_56"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inappropriate detention and to clarify circumstances in which detention of someone with an autistic spectrum disorder is appropriate.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07010816000014"></a>The only reference in the code to appropriate detention of a person with an autistic spectrum disorder is to the person being unable to prevent themselves causing severe harm to themselves or others. Would this not be considered abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible behaviour? It would be valuable to hear from the Minister about what the very rare circumstances envisaged might be, in which a person with an autistic spectrum disorder could be detained without mental illness and without displaying abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible behaviour. I fully understand that it may not be possible to give that answer now, but I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this amendment further, and ask the Minister if he would be willing to consider this matter further and have further discussions with stakeholders. I look forward to hearing further discussion on this matter now. I beg to move.</p>

The Government&#146;s position&#151;if I do not misrepresent them&#151;is that we gain very much more by having a single and unqualified definition of mental disorder than we would gain by building in various categories of exemption. We will be debating the issue of exclusions in some detail when we reach Amendment No. 4, and I do not want to pre-empt those discussions. The Government&#146;s reason for taking this position is to ensure that clinicians do not get hung up on what diagnostic label may be hanging around someone&#146;s neck, but rather pay attention to what their needs are and what behaviour or symptoms they are exhibiting.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07010816000016"></a>In the case of autistic spectrum disorders, I expect that this is the argument we will hear. It is not an argument that can be brushed aside lightly, but I disagree with it. Autistic spectrum disorders are disorders characterised by impaired communication and social interaction. They are not psychotic disorders; nor are they mental illnesses. What the National Autistic Society fears, as the noble Baroness said, is that far from the single definition in the Bill making life simpler and ensuring that only people who have a disorder or disability of the mind are detained, it will cause confusion and result in more people with autistic spectrum disorders being detained than is justified. The behaviour of someone with an autistic spectrum disorder may well resemble that of someone with a mental disorder. We need to be sure that one is not mistaken for the other. If a person is neither mentally ill nor behaving in an abnormally aggressive or irresponsible way, quite simply, they should not be detained compulsorily under the Mental Health Act.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07010816000017"></a>It is perfectly true that people with ASDs have a higher than average incidence of mental health problems. We do not want to say that by virtue of having an autistic spectrum disorder they should be excluded from the scope of the Bill altogether. That really would be a mistake. If we imagine an autistic

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07010816000018"></a>There is a way out of this, suggested by the noble Baroness. Unless we add to Clause 2 the words in the amendment, we will have a situation where someone with a learning disability and an autistic spectrum disorder, but without mental illness, could still be detained, even if they were not displaying seriously irresponsible or aggressive behaviour. That surely cannot be what we want. I very much hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness.</p>

I would not resile from those views for one moment. I agree entirely with what she said, although I would put it in a slightly different way, to add something&#151;I hope&#151;to the way she expressed herself. The committee was of the view that this was, in many senses, an issue of discrimination. People suffering from autistic spectrum disorders carry out valuable roles in society. I suspect that there are not a few people suffering from autistic spectrum disorders not a million miles from where we sit now and the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07010816000020"></a>If I may be anecdotal for moment, I recall that last year someone came to install some case analysis software on my laptop in my barristers&#146; chambers. He explained to me that in his business he employs four people who suffer from autistic spectrum disorders to prepare and analyse the vast quantities of case material&#151;and we were talking about a huge fraud case&#151;which were to be reduced into a particular CD-ROM format. To his great credit, he told me that not only are they among his most valued employees, but that everyone in his firm earns the same wage, so that they earn exactly as much as he does. He was amazed that more companies were not using people suffering from autistic spectrum disorders to deal with very complex issues of that kind, which maximise the particular abilities that some people suffering from autistic spectrum disorders, including Asperger&#146;s syndrome, experience.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07010816000021"></a>To say that people suffering from autistic spectrum disorders are not &#147;normal members of society&#148; is, in my view, discriminatory and insulting to those people. Returning to where I started, I should say that it seemed to the committee that, although people with autistic spectrum disorders had a greater incidence of mental disorders in their lives, there was no evidence before us to support the view that one could assume that they suffered from mental disorder. The provisions as they stand imply that assumption. If the amendment is accepted by the Government there would be no deficit in the effectiveness of this legislation in relation to people suffering from autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

The awful point is that if you start naming various conditions, we will get a never-ending list. Most of us who have dealt with disabilities over a period of time know that one of the problems we face is the stereotype. There are certain preconceptions to do with the way that people with disabilities&#151;either obvious or hidden&#151;relate to the world. The deaf may have tremendous problems relating to people if the batteries in their hearing aids are low or if there is no loop in the room. Their behaviour could be interpreted as aggressive if you happen to catch them on a bad day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07010816000023"></a>I do not like the idea of naming a condition in the Bill and saying that it is fundamentally different. I have spent countless hours in this Chamber saying that disabled people should be treated wherever possible in the same way as the rest of the world. We are in trouble if we start to introduce caveats suggesting that we need not take into account that a disability will lead to slightly different patterns of behaviour. That would be the flipside of saying, &#147;Does he take sugar? Dear lad. Pat him on the head and put him in his wheelchair in the corner&#148;. It would be like saying, &#147;They are all monsters&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07010816000024"></a>I would be much happier if the Government would explain their thinking on this matter. The fact is that illness can occur to any disability group regardless of whether it is mental or physical. Why introduce a second caveat? It may be because people are worried that this group has been labelled in the past. I may not have listened to enough of what has been going on in this Bill, but please could we have more clarification of the Government&#146;s thinking?</p>

It then defines four specific categories of mental disorder&#151;mental illness, mental impairment, severe mental impairment and psychopathic disorder. Mental impairment and severe mental impairment can be identified with learning disabilities of different degrees of severity, but are defined in such a way that they cover those disabilities only where they are associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07010816000026"></a>Many of the powers in the Act&#151;including, for example, detention for medical treatment under Section 3&#151;may be exercised only if the patient is suffering from one or more of the four categories of mental disorder. Some powers, including the Home Secretary&#146;s ability to transfer unsentenced prisoners to hospital when they urgently need treatment for mental disorder, apply only to certain categories of disorder&#151;in that example, only mental illness and severe mental impairment.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07010816000027"></a>We believe that the use of the Act should be determined by a patient&#146;s needs and the risk posed by their disorder, not by the particular legal label applied to it. The four separate categories of mental disorder in the Act are legal distinctions that do not match  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_59"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clinical practice. They create arbitrary and unnecessary distinctions between patients and effectively exclude some patients entirely from certain parts of the Act. They also sometimes encourage some patients and their lawyers to argue about legal classifications in the hope of obtaining premature discharge, even when they remain in need of treatment. That is why Clause 1 removes the four categories of mental disorder. Criteria for admission for treatment will now apply uniformly to any disorder or disability of the mind, rather than being dependent on a patient having a particular category of mental disorder.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07010816000028"></a>However, Clause 2 deliberately maintains the idea that key parts of the Act should apply to learning disability only when associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct. That is what we mean by the learning disability qualification. Our intention in including the qualification in Clause 2 was to preserve the effect of the Act in relation to learning disabilities. It was not to change it by effectively excluding more disorders from the scope of many of the powers in the Act. I am at one with the noble Lord; as a general principle, we believe that the fewer exclusions there are the better, because each one adds to the risk of arbitrarily excluding people who need to be helped. That itself would be a powerful argument for not extending Clause 2 to cover autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07010816000029"></a>But we also think that there is a clinical distinction between autistic spectrum disorders and learning disability. A learning disability will include the presence of a significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information or to learn new skills, and a reduced ability to cope independently. It will not necessarily be accompanied by the difficulties that a person with an autistic spectrum disorder will have with communication and relating to people around them. It is because of these communication difficulties that we believe that people with autistic spectrum disorders are better served by not being subject to any limitation. That way, in the rare cases where the Act needs to be used&#151;for example, to help an autistic person who might otherwise attempt suicide&#151;debates about diagnosis will not present an obstacle.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07010816000030"></a>In fact, by removing categories of mental disorder, we are making it clear that all the provisions of the Act apply to people with autistic spectrum disorders, where necessary. At present, the arbitrary distinctions between the four categories of disorder leave room for uncertainty about the extent to which the Act applies to people with autistic spectrum disorders&#151;although a small number of people with such a disorder are certainly detained under the Act already.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07010816000031"></a>As a result of the change that we are making, when clinicians are called on to determine whether the Act ought to be used in relation to a person with such a disorder they will be able to concentrate on the individual&#146;s needs and the risk posed by their disorder, rather than on whether the disorder fits one of four arbitrary legal categories, or whether the person&#146;s autism is accompanied by seriously irresponsible or abnormally aggressive behaviour. Also, including

Given that people with autism are more often aloof than aggressive, that would impose a constraint on the courts that might occasionally lead to people being detained in prison where it would be more appropriate to use the Mental Health Act.</p>

<a name="70108-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07010816000032"></a>Amending the Act in the way that we have done will ensure that it can be used for the very few people with autistic spectrum disorders for whom detention or other compulsory intervention is justified, without any uncertainty about whether and how they fit into its legal framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07010816000045"></a>Clause 2 says that people with a learning disability are not normally by virtue of their disability to be considered to have a mental disorder for the purposes of the Mental Health Act,</p>

<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_62"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>spectrum disorders on the same footing as learning disability. Amendment No. 3 seeks to change the structure of Clause 2, placing learning disability on a different footing. I hope the noble Baroness will accept my explanation as to why I did not intervene.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07010816000048"></a>In explaining what this amendment means, I must first make it clear that it does not mean that people with a learning disability would be excluded from the scope of the Bill altogether. People with a learning disability may well have a mental health problem or a mental disorder which needs to be treated under compulsion. Everyone who has a mental health problem comes within the scope of the Bill, including people who also have a learning disability. Indeed, there is evidence that the prevalence of mental ill health among adults with a learning disability is higher than the prevalence of mental ill health among the general population. Only last week, I read an article in the latest edition of the <I>British Journal of Psychiatry</I> reporting on a cohort study in Scotland&#151;even though it is a small nation&#151;which found that more than 40 per cent of adults with a learning disability also experienced mental ill health. Other research has suggested that the prevalence of depression among people with a learning disability is four times greater than that among people without a learning disability, and that the prevalence of schizophrenia among people with a learning disability is three times greater than that among the general population.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07010816000049"></a>Just as my noble friend Lord Adebowale, in moving Amendment No. 5, rightly seeks to make it clear that dependence on alcohol or drugs does not preclude the existence of a mental disorder, so I want to emphasise that having a learning disability does not preclude the existence of a mental disorder either.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07010816000050"></a>I labour this point for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that my amendment would not prevent people with a learning disability being made subject to compulsory powers. They would still be more likely to come under the scope of the Bill than the general population. Secondly, and more importantly, abnormal aggression or serious irresponsibility&#151;the characteristics for which people with a learning disability could be sectioned under the Bill as it stands&#151;may in many cases be caused not by a person&#146;s learning disability but by an underlying health condition which ought to be treated. I am concerned that the Bill as it stands would allow people with a learning disability who also have a mental health problem to be sectioned on the basis of learning disability plus aggression, leaving their mental health problems undiagnosed and unaddressed. Framing a law in a way which may incentivise misdiagnosis, or lazy or convenient diagnosis, is not helpful.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07010816000051"></a>We already know about serious inequalities in the standard of healthcare experienced by people with a learning disability. Mencap&#146;s 2004 report, <I>Treat Me Right!</I>, and the Disability Rights Commission&#146;s 2006 formal investigation, <I>Equal Treatment: Closing the Gap</I>, both found evidence of diagnostic overshadowing, in which symptoms of health problems displayed by people with a learning  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_63"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>disability were treated as being part of the learning disability, rather than as evidence of a coexisting condition. This could mean a person with a learning disability who is behaving in an aggressive or irresponsible way has their mental health problems completely overlooked.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07010816000052"></a>Aggression and irresponsibility may be symptomatic of physical health problems, or stress. Allowing people with a learning disability who are aggressive or irresponsible to be sectioned on that basis may lead to physical health problems being missed. Mencap&#146;s <I>Treat Me Right!</I> report contains an account by the mother of Simon, who has a learning disability:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07010816000074"></a>&#147;We knew there was something wrong with Simon. He was scratching his face and screaming and seemed extremely distressed. So we took him to see his GP, who couldn&#146;t find anything the matter. We kept saying that we thought he must be in pain. But he just wouldn&#146;t listen. He told us: &#145;That's just the way they are sometimes. Just take him home.&#146; Luckily, the dentist took more time to examine Simon and found that he had an abscess. I hate to think how much pain he must have been in&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70108-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07010816000053"></a>Fortunately, this case had a happy ending and did not involve the use of mental health law. Yet it is not difficult to see how things could have been different, here and in many other cases. My concern is for people like Simon who, being unable to communicate, may respond to pain by lashing out and being violent. It is also for people like Simon&#146;s GP, who may simply write this behaviour off as being part of the learning disability and who, in order to protect the patient or those around him, use the Mental Health Act to provide the wrong kind of treatment under compulsion.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07010816000054"></a>I am concerned that Clause 2 may make it less likely that people with a learning disability who behave in an aggressive or irresponsible way will have other underlying mental and physical health problems identified and treated, so the Bill as drafted could lead to people with a learning disability being misdiagnosed and not getting the treatment that they need. It is not the purpose of the Bill to provide people with worse health conditions, but I am worried that it may be the effect. Perhaps the code of practice could be used to make this clearer. Amendment No. 72, which we shall debate in due course, would give the code statutory force, which might help to eliminate some of the poor practice which I am worried about.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07010816000055"></a>It is also worth pointing out that when a person lacks capacity in relation to the question of whether he should be given medical treatment, he can be treated in his best interests under the Mental Capacity Act. When people with a learning disability behave in an aggressive and irresponsible way, they will in most cases lack capacity.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07010816000056"></a>I should say a few words about the diversion of people with a learning disability from criminal punishment to hospital. The amendment would, after all, provide that that could not happen unless they also had another mental disorder. First, it is true that prison is not an ideal environment for people with a learning disability but there is evidence that there are very many people with a learning disability in the prison system anyway.  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_64"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There may be very good reasons for wanting to divert them away from it, but the Mental Health Bill, if enacted even with this amendment, would allow them to be diverted from it only if they were &#147;abnormally aggressive&#148; or &#147;seriously irresponsible&#148;. It would leave most prisoners with a learning disability exactly where they are. There are many potential public policy options for providing better support to people with a learning disability who find themselves within the criminal justice system, and I am not convinced that using mental health law, which will only ever touch a small minority of them, is a particularly effective one. Secondly, my concern that the &#147;aggression or irresponsibility&#148; caveat can make mental and physical illness less likely to be diagnosed in people with a learning disability applies just as much to people inside the criminal justice system as to those outside it.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07010816000057"></a>My concern in moving this amendment is not only on the grounds of the principled position that a learning disability is completely different from a mental illness, and should not be treated as such. I have always held that position, and I still hold it now. I am pleased to see that the Disability Rights Commission, commenting on my amendment, agrees with me, describing Clause 2 as it stands as,</p>
<ul><a name="07010816000081"></a>&#147;discriminatory, stigmatising, inappropriate and unnecessary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010816000058"></a>My concern is also that the clause may bring under the scope of mental health legislation people who even the Government think should not be there, or may put them there for the wrong reasons, so that the underlying cause of their aggression or irresponsibility is not addressed.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07010816000059"></a>As the clause stands, it would allow people to be sectioned on the basis of learning disability when other courses of action would be more appropriate; it incentivises bad practice when we know that good practice is far from universal; it allows the symptoms&#151;aggression or irresponsibility&#151;to overshadow the causes, be they mental or physical ill health or simply distress; and makes it less likely that people with a learning disability will get the treatment that they need. I hope that the Minister will be able to begin his new job on the best possible footing, by finding a way of making sure that people with a learning disability are not disadvantaged by mental health law. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07010816000062"></a>I remind noble Lords that during the passage of the Mental Capacity Act, I was one of those who argued most strongly that there should be an equality provision in that Act and there should not be discrimination.

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07010816000063"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, is absolutely right in saying that people with learning disabilities have the right to expect the same treatment and regard as anybody else. That has been the thrust of legislation in recent years, not least with the Mental Capacity Act, and it should be the thrust of this legislation too. At a very simple level, having a clause in the Bill in which the words &#147;learning disability&#148; and, &#147;abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct&#148;, come together reinforces some of those stereotypes, about which my noble friend Lord Addington spoke so eloquently in relation to the previous amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07010816000064"></a>For all the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, outlined with better erudition than I ever could, I believe that we should support him.</p>

I and the organisation for which I work&#151;and, again, I declare an interest with regard to Turning Point, which provides a service to about 8,000 people with learning disabilities, some of whom have very challenging behaviour problems too&#151;believe that learning disability should not constitute mental disorder. In fact, the principle is one of equality; it is as simple as that. None of this is rocket science. Without wishing to go back to an earlier debate, this is about the principle of equality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07010816000066"></a>The most appropriate legislation under which the majority of people with a learning disability should receive treatment is the Mental Capacity Act, when it comes into force in April. People who lack capacity who are also subject to the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 will still be protected by the Mental Capacity Act with regard to the types of decisions or actions affecting them. Therefore, when a decision unrelated to treatment for mental disorder needs to be made, including decisions about physical healthcare, welfare or financial matters, an assessment must be made of the individual&#146;s capacity to make that particular decision when it needs to be made. It is important that the code of practice spells out that the principles and provisions of the Mental Capacity Act  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_66"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would apply to all such decisions or actions, regardless of whether the person was subject to the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983. There is a danger that the behaviour of some people who have a learning disability will be misinterpreted and mistakenly attributed to mental disorder. In my 20 years or so of working with government departments, I have worked with many people who have either a learning disability or another disability and whose behaviour has been extraordinarily aggressive. They would certainly be very shocked to find themselves coming under the Mental Health Act. People with a learning disability are in danger of having their behaviour misinterpreted and mistakenly attributed to a mental disorder. As has been pointed out, that is quite simply wrong, when there is a physical or environmental reason for their behaviour.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07010817000001"></a>To illustrate this point, let me tell you a story, which ended in the use of the Mental Health Act. Mr S, who has a severe learning difficulty, autism and communication difficulties, lives in a residential setting. He was detained under the 1983 Act because he was becoming increasingly agitated and exhibited aggressive behaviour, banging his head against a wall. It was later discovered&#151;this is shocking but true&#151;that Mr S had a small twig in his ear, which was causing him distress, as it would most people, and which he expressed by his agitated behaviour. This scenario shows how the distress of a person with a learning disability can be automatically attributed to a mental disorder without paying sufficient attention to physical factors. This is about not just lazy diagnosis but making fatal assumptions.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07010817000002"></a>The issue is education and skills among professionals. It is about being able to correctly assess whether a person has a co-existing mental health problem alongside a learning disability. Here again it is inappropriate to use mental health legislation to compensate for the lack of these skills if a person does not have an additional mental disorder. The Government should support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, but might also want to make it explicit that, if a person has both a learning disability and a co-existing mental disorder, they should be able to receive appropriate treatment under the Act.</p>

He has said it so eloquently that, like the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, I do not want to add much. This is really about ensuring that people with learning disabilities are not discriminated against and have a proper assessment of their mental disorder.

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07010817000004"></a>Underlying some of the Government&#146;s thinking is the notion that we must not risk people with learning disabilities being caught up in the criminal justice system when it is inappropriate for that to happen. The reason why that happens is because of the poor availability of proper consultant psychiatry to people with learning disabilities. It is a developing field, which has got much better in recent years, but there is still tremendous discrimination. The opportunity to

I remind the Committee of the wording of the recommendation from the Joint Scrutiny Committee. Our report pointed out that people with learning disabilities or communicative disorders should be,</p>
<ul><a name="07010817000052"></a>&#147;liable for compulsory treatment under the Bill only if they display seriously aggressive or severely irresponsible behaviour as a result of their condition and if such treatment as is properly and reasonably required can only be provided to such patients under conditions of compulsion&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010817000044"></a>That last condition is present in the Bill as it is currently drafted. That is why this amendment is so important. Our discussion and the difficulties raised are very much underpinned by the problem of the principles not being stated in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07010817000045"></a>This is all about correct diagnosis, as the anecdotes have so clearly illustrated. If someone with a learning disability also has a mental disorder it is appropriate for the Act to kick in and for compulsion to be used, if that is the only way that that mental disorder can be treated. However, under the Mental Capacity Act, if someone with a learning disability does not also have a mental disorder, but does not have the capacity, they can in any case be provided with the care and treatment that is in their best interest under that Act. For those people who do not have a mental disorder that requires treatment and for the patient who is not accepting treatment for a mental disorder, the trigger of accurate diagnosis is key. Without that, all the groups&#151;such as the United Kingdom Disabled People&#146;s Council and the other groups that have made representations on this clause&#151;will have their fears enhanced, not decreased, as this Bill goes through. The other problem with people&#146;s fears being enhanced is that they are less likely to access care and treatment early, when they need it and when intervention is much less. When problems escalate, they become greater and more difficult to deal with.</p>

My view is that this clause suffers from serious terminological inexactitude.

He does not want to see one confused with the other. I am entirely with him on that, as with the points on discrimination and stigma, and on wrong and lazy diagnosis. In expressing that support for his amendment, I have two worries, both of which are practical.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07010817000009"></a>By removing lines 10 and 11 from the clause, the noble Lord, as he acknowledged, is effectively excluding people with learning disabilities from the scope of the Mental Health Act altogether, unless at one and the same time there is a mental illness or mental disorder also present. I worry how that leaves someone with a learning disability who is behaving in a very aggressive or irresponsible way and who may be a risk to himself or to others. If the police are summoned to a scene where they witness such behaviour, what are they to do? The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, suggested that the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act might come into play here. I want to ask her or the Minister whether we are quite sure that the provisions of that Act could be used to administer care and treatment in the person&#146;s best interest. I am far from clear that the provisions of that Act would cover this kind of situation, because the Act does not authorise detention. If that is correct, the police&#146;s only recourse would be the criminal justice system. That seems to me to be an even worse avenue for the individual, and certainly a much less therapeutic one, than to be admitted to hospital. I am simply making a pragmatic point here.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07010817000010"></a>My second worry was raised by various witnesses giving evidence to the Joint Scrutiny Committee on the 2004 draft Bill. A case known as the HL case was dealt with recently by the European Court of Human Rights. The decision in that case, in the view of at least one witness, means that whatever the definitional niceties that we have been talking about, it will be necessary to devise some sort of legal framework whereby people with learning disabilities can be admitted to hospital and given the kind of safeguards provided by the Mental Health Act and this Bill. I am thinking particularly of the extension of the tribunal&#146;s remit. If I am broadly correct about that case and its effect, it is important. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it. If I could put a brutal question to him: is the Bill a quick and ready short cut to addressing the findings in that case?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07010817000012"></a>Indeed, very few of the provisions of the Act would apply to a learning disability that was not accompanied by any other recognised mental disorder, even if associated with,</p>
<ul><a name="07010817000053"></a>&#147;abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010817000046"></a>I have the greatest respect for the noble Lord, Lord Rix, who is a tireless advocate for the rights and interests of people with learning disabilities. I know that he has met officials in my department, but I have to say that the Government are not in favour of this amendment. He discussed on Second Reading his involvement in the development of the wording in the current Act in relation to learning disability; that is the very wording,</p>
<ul><a name="07010817000054"></a>&#147;abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010817000047"></a>that his amendment now asks your Lordships&#146; House to remove.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07010817000013"></a>We are, of course, well aware of the strongly held view that learning disabilities should not be labelled as a mental disorder, both on principle and for fear of exacerbating confusion between learning disability and mental illness. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, will know that I understand that point of view. We recognise that learning disabilities are not the same as mental illness, but they are recognised disorders or disabilities of the mind. The crux of this issue is that the Act is not about labelling people; it is about making sure that they can be treated where necessary. Excluding people with learning disabilities from the definition entirely would risk the very small minority of those people who need compulsion not getting it, or else would require clinicians sometimes to apply inappropriate diagnostic labels to ensure that they can give the treatment that they believe is needed. That is why learning disability remains a mental disorder for the purposes of the Act generally. None the less, we all agree that the powers in the Act should not be used just because someone has a learning disability; hence our decision to include a special provision to preserve the effect of the current Act in relation to learning disability, despite the abolition of categories of mental disorder, in particular those of mental impairment and severe mental impairment. Thus, in future people who have a learning disability will be treated in exactly the same way as they are at present, but we are not persuaded that we should go further.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07010817000014"></a>I fully accept the comments that have been made about the potential problem of misdiagnosis. I have taken careful note of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has made about the importance of ensuring good practice in the diagnosis of mental health problems in people with learning disabilities. I acknowledge that people who have a learning disability have special difficulty in communicating the nature of their health problems in ways that may be mistaken for mental disorders. I agree that picking up physical health problems is an important issue for anyone with a mental disorder. For everyone who may be assessed for possible mental health problems, it is  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_70"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important to establish that their psychological presentation is not a reflection of underlying physical health problems. That is especially so in the case of people with learning disabilities.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07010817000015"></a>We do not believe that by so defining the clause we are stigmatising people with learning disabilities. In no way does a learning disability qualification suggest that abnormally aggressive or irresponsible behaviour are associated with learning disabilities; quite the opposite. It is not inappropriate, and it certainly makes no assumption that detention in hospital is the best approach for people with learning disabilities who offend, but it makes sure that the option is open to the courts where appropriate. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, asked what &#147;abnormally aggressive&#148; and so on means. I am advised that the term has been used since 1983, and that the words have to take their normal meaning. Case law suggests that conduct is to be judged by general standards, not those of other people with a learning disability.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07010817000016"></a>I say to those noble Lords who have expressed concern that the real problem here is about misdiagnosis and a lack of adequate services&#151;and I suspect that I will repeat this on a number of occasions&#151;that good practice is an area in which it can be difficult to legislate, especially where we want to legislate in such a way as to give mental health professionals the maximum latitude to make decisions flexibly in the best interests of the mentally disordered person. But clearly the code of practice is an appropriate avenue in which to look at the issues that the noble Lord has raised. I will look at ways of strengthening, the code of practice to take account of his and others concerns in this area.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07010817000017"></a>On the use of the Mental Capacity Act to guarantee treatment for people with learning disabilities, it is important to make it clear that many such people have the capacity to make their own decisions about treatment, even when they are experiencing particular mental health problems, and we must not assume that they do not. For those people, the Mental Health Act is more appropriate, because it treats them in the same way as anyone else who refuses to consent to the mental health care that they need.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07010817000018"></a>The answer to the question asked by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is no. He can find the answer in Part 2, in the so-called Bournewood safeguards, which deal with the situation that he raised. The Government&#146;s view is that, notwithstanding the need to ensure that diagnosis is as effective as possible, the code of practice needs to be reviewed in the light of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Rix. This amendment, if adopted, would potentially leave a small minority of people with learning disabilities in a more vulnerable position than at present. That is why we would prefer to leave the safeguard in the Bill.</p>

I knew that the Government would say what they did, because in my discussions with the Bill team last week and in the two letters that I received, in particular the one from the noble Lord, Lord Warner, more or less exactly the same points were made. I realise that I have a bit of an uphill struggle. However, I would like to meet the Minister again before Report to see whether we can reach some compromise and to discuss strengthening the code of practice, which I think is terribly important. The code of practice would be a very good background for sorting out this problem about learning disability, especially if Amendment No. 72 were passed, as that would make the code a little more enforceable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07010817000022"></a>I have a sense of d&#233;jÃ  vu. The conversation that I had with the noble Lord, Lord Elton, 24 years ago was not dissimilar to the conversation, albeit one-sided, that we have just heard from the Minister, who put the same sort of arguments. Twenty-four years ago, I queried whether the meaning of the words &#147;abnormally aggressive&#148; and &#147;seriously irresponsible conduct&#148; was quite clear. I believe that if I were a diagnosing doctor&#151;rather, if I were two diagnosing doctors&#151;I could easily say that the person was being abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible and we would back each other up; it would be much easier and quicker to do that than to look for the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07010817000023"></a>I am not convinced, although I totally understand the Government&#146;s arguments. For years, we described learning disability as a mental handicap. As noble Lords will know, we removed the words &#147;mental handicap&#148; from our organisation&#146;s title; it is still called Mencap, as an abbreviation, although that could now apply to the Mental Capacity Act rather than to the Mental Health Act. The word &#147;mental&#148; and the stigma of applying the Mental Health Act to people with a learning disability are closely related. That is why I should like a clearer definition in the Bill. However, until we can have our discussions, as I hope we shall, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07010817000028"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 5. We come now to another issue that in many ways epitomises the fault line that separates the Government and the mental health community over the Bill. The question that Amendment No. 4 poses is to what extent the definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148; as it appears in the Bill should be qualified by exclusions that restrict the manner in which the powers in the legislation may be applied&#151;in other words, should the Bill delineate clear boundaries around the new and simplified definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148; as a guide to clinicians and other practitioners who will be called on to implement the Bill?</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07010817000029"></a>The Government&#146;s broad position is simple. They maintain that if the whole point of the legislation is for each patient to be treated according to his or her needs, we should not want clinicians to be sidetracked by or hung up about diagnostic labels of any sort. Professionals should be clinically free to decide what steps it is right to take in particular circumstances. If a particular sort of behavioural tendency is not classified as a mental disorder in any case, it is unnecessary to spell out in the Bill that it should not be regarded as such.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07010817000030"></a>I suspect that that is the line that we shall hear from the Minister today, but I suggest to her that there is another way of looking at this question. It has to do with two things: the nature of the decision-making process by clinicians and the entire context in which powers of compulsion are used and will continue to be used. When a clinician has to decide whether or not to detain a particular individual compulsorily, he first has to make a diagnosis based in large measure on the individual&#146;s behaviour. But a diagnosis of mental disorder is not value free. It is not like a diagnosis of measles, which rests on clear clinical signs and symptoms. Rather, it depends on a subjective judgment&#151;a judgment based on knowledge and experience, certainly, but ultimately one that is dependent on that clinician&#146;s discretion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07010817000031"></a>Certain sorts of behaviour that materially depart from societal norms can be viewed through one set of value judgments as deviant and dangerous or through another as merely distasteful and eccentric. One example of that would be certain sorts of sexual behaviour, such as gender dysphoria, transsexualism and fetishism. Some people tolerate these things; some people do not. In fact, disorders of sexual

Yet do we really wish to signal to clinicians that they are entitled to regard someone as mentally ill simply because they display these tendencies? I suggest that we do not. Indeed, I completely disagree with the Government when they make it clear in paragraph 32 of the Explanatory Notes that they intend to bring conditions such as fetishism within the scope of the 1983 Act.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07010817000032"></a>There is a wider point. Parliament has recently outlawed discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Without an exclusion of the kind in paragraph (b) of the amendment, the way would be clear for clinicians to allow their own values to interfere with what should be the only question in their minds: does this person or does he not have a mental disorder that makes him suitable for psychiatric detention? The value of an explicit exclusion is that it provides a marker to make sure that practitioners carefully evaluate the basis for compulsory treatment in accordance with accepted parameters.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07010817000033"></a>Placed alongside that idea is the context in which these often difficult and painful decisions are to be made. Among the black and ethnic-minority communities, mental health services are regarded with intense suspicion. Why is that so? It is because, as we have heard already, a disproportionately high number of people from those communities are sectioned and detained against their will.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07010817000034"></a>If we accept the proposal in the Bill for a broad definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148;, which in principle I am perfectly prepared to do, the quid pro quo for that should be a set of riders that make it absolutely clear that the Bill is not designed as a licence to increase the numbers further. Any definition that might serve to do that, however well intentioned, should be qualified explicitly to ensure that it does not. If it is admitted that under the 1983 Act unwarranted discrimination takes place as a result of racial stereotyping, that on its own is the answer to anyone who says, as the Government have been wont to do, that cultural beliefs and behaviours are not mental disorders and therefore cannot legally be used as grounds for detention. If, in practice, that proposition is being widely ignored, then we have a positive duty to promote equality of treatment in the Bill. We can do that by means of an explicit exclusion, even at the risk of stating what to a parliamentary draftsman might seem technically otiose.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07010817000035"></a>However, there are other ways in which the breadth and generality of the new definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148; could be seen as risky. Let us take substance misuse. The Bill provides for an exception for dependence on alcohol or drugs but it does not provide an exemption for someone who is simply drunk or has misused drugs in a way that will not cause him long-term harm, if I can make that assumption. Surely we do not want the legislation to signal to clinicians that being drunk or having taken an illegal substance in itself equates to a mental disorder. Under ICD 10, both misuse and dependence are covered and therefore, in my view, we  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_74"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should have an exclusion to cover both. Once again, such an exclusion would act as a marker to prevent decisions&#151;sometimes very fraught decisions&#151;being taken on the wrong clinical basis.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07010817000036"></a>Curiously enough, the Government have accepted the argument that there should be an exclusion covering substance dependency. Presumably, in doing so, they accept that there is a point to having an exclusion of this sort and that having it does not pose any serious risk that someone might be denied compulsory treatment just because their disorder manifests itself in certain behaviour. That must be the Government&#146;s position, and, if so, I agree with them. The risk is not one that should concern us. On the contrary, we want to say to practitioners, &#147;By all means use your professional judgment and discretion about what may be right for the individual patient, but you can use the powers of compulsion granted to you in this Act only if you are certain that there is a mental disorder present that is quite separate from any of the behaviours or conditions listed in this amendment&#148;. That is surely not a complicated message or one that risks any denial of psychiatric treatment when it is genuinely needed.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07010817000037"></a>There are two other categories of exclusion listed in the amendment that I have not covered: illegal or disorderly acts and political beliefs. As regards illegal acts, the point is quite simple. When someone is behaving in a manner that is clearly illegal, whether the behaviour consists of causing an affray in public or committing acts of paedophilia, such an act should not be seen by the police, doctors or anyone else as a reason for applying powers of psychiatric compulsion. Criminal acts should be dealt with using the accepted means provided for under criminal law, and doctors need to be clear about that.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07010817000038"></a>With disorderly acts and political beliefs, we are into human rights territory. There are certain advantages to having a broad definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148;, as proposed in the Bill, but one potential downside is that it lacks certainty. All of us are old enough to remember regimes around the world in which psychiatry was misused to clamp down on behaviour that related not to a treatable mental disorder but, rather, to socially or politically unacceptable behaviour. The definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148; was deliberately twisted to encompass matters that were no concern of medicine, still less of the state. I do not say that there is a realistic prospect of the same happening in this country&#151;certainly not in a systematic way&#151;but, once again, we need to remember the importance of perceptions and public trust.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07010817000039"></a>The powers of compulsion granted in the Bill are no trivial matter. If among certain people&#151;not least black and ethnic-minority communities&#151;psychiatry is seen, however unjustifiably, as a ready means for the establishment to lock away whomever it wants on whatever pretext it chooses, then the effectiveness of psychiatric services in assessing and treating genuine mental disorders will be diminished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07010817000040"></a>I ask the Minister one thing: not to reject the amendment out of hand, as her brief probably urges her to do, but to take it away and reconsider it. All the

That is the platform on which I am standing, and I hope that the Government will be able to join me on it. I beg to move.</p>

I was walking down a street in America where a lady was behaving in a very loud fashion: she was preaching in a hectoring manner. I was very small and found it quite frightening. The adults with me said, &#147;It&#146;s okay. She&#146;s just a bit crazy and that&#146;s what she does&#148;. I had forgotten that incident until about five years ago when I was reading a biography of Hillary Clinton. Mrs Clinton is a lady who brings about quite extreme reactions but I was taken with her because, when she was a young lawyer in Arkansas, she was noted for things such as driving many hundreds of miles to defend ladies who &#147;preached a bit crazy&#148; in the street on the grounds that they were allowed to do that. I was also reminded of that early incident about two years ago when I was walking through Brixton and came across a lady preaching very loudly in the middle of the street.</p>

<a name="70108-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07010817000042"></a>All those things came back to me as I read through the briefings for this Bill, because what we and society decide is acceptable and &#147;just a bit crazy&#148; or something that should bring someone under compulsory powers may be subjective matters involving time, place and context. That is why it is important that we have this debate. There is always an element of subjectivity in any assessment or analysis of a person&#146;s behaviour. As the Minister said earlier, the 1983 Act provided a fine balance between compulsory powers and rights of representation for individuals. That was a much more balanced piece of legislation than that which we have before us now and yet we have had report after report showing that even that legislation, tuned as it was at the time, has a disproportionate effect on some communities because behaviour is interpreted in wholly different ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07010817000043"></a>Why is it important to have an amendment like this? The joint scrutiny committee concluded that the wider the definition of &#147;mental disorder&#148;, the greater the need for exclusions. I am sure that the Minister will talk about the need for clinicians to have scope to employ their judgment. I do not believe that these amendments will in any way compromise that. The Mental Health Commission, in its evidence to the joint scrutiny committee, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07010817000051"></a>&#147;For the law to be of value&#151;to patients, State administrators, mental health professionals, the police, the courts or the Tribunal&#151;its meaning cannot rest upon the discretion of those working within its framework.

</ul>
<p><a name="07010817000048"></a>Therefore, it is important, in these very difficult areas of sexual behaviour, illegal or disorderly acts or cultural, religious or political beliefs, that we, as Parliament, set boundaries within which we expect

It is beholden on us to ensure that there is a correct balance between the width of the definition of mental disorder and the extent to which compulsion can be brought to bear on patients with specific exclusions. We should support the amendment.</p>

<a name="07010823000001"></a><b><a name="70108-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010823000023"></a>Baroness Murphy:</b> A subtext runs beneath many of the Government&#146;s proposals. I say, &#147;Mind the gap&#148;. In trying to change the 1983 Act, the Government, in almost every single clause, are concerned to try to include patients who have been excluded from the 1983 Act as a result of poor psychiatric practice. That is the subtext of much of the Bill. In trying to close those gaps they have forgotten that the law has been used only as an excuse.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07010823000002"></a>Take, for example, a 20-bed unit with 110 per cent occupancy. When one considers whether to admit someone who has a mental disorder, one will consider whether he can be treated, whether he will be out again in 48 hours and whether he can be supported in the community. One could also consider admitting a rather challenging, difficult Mr Smith who is persistently drunk, never takes his medication, and about whom it is unsure whether he can be dealt with over the next two to three months, so he will be in the bed longer. When someone asks why one did not admit this or that person, the answer is that the law did not allow it. That is repeated over and over again. I cannot tell you how often it happens. That is what lies behind the very wise amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, who sees people excluded from care every day of the week.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07010823000003"></a>Is the answer to put such a matter in legislation, widening the scope of the Act to include many people who would not otherwise be considered for detention? For various reasons the answer is no. The answer is training, resources, better understanding of what is possible and better understanding of how to help people with difficult and challenging problems such as substance misuse and paedophilia, but one cannot include them all.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07010823000004"></a>The amendment is about stopping detention creep. In this country it is quite difficult to get people to take it seriously because since the 1959 Act we have had a tradition of using psychiatric hospitals and units almost exclusively, but not entirely, for the care of people with mental disorder. But that exclusiveness is a relatively recent phenomenon. Mental hospitals and asylums in the 19th century and before and after the First World War became repositories for all kinds of socially excluded people when there did not seem to be anywhere else to put them. In those days if one were in a mental hospital, one was detained by default. The destitute unmarried mother, the epileptic, the merely eccentric and the socially incompetent all tumbled into the asylums. They were a social inconvenience but everyone colluded in saying that there was nowhere else for them to go. In the 1970s, when I first worked in psychiatric hospitals outside the great fringe around London&#151;what we call the Epsom archipelago&#151;the place was full in the back wards of people whom we had enormous difficulty diagnosing with anything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07010823000005"></a>Society does not know what to do with other social misfits. One group is those who are persistently addle-headed on drink and drugs. They are very difficult to help. Of course, there are ways to help them, but it is not easy. Paedophiles form another group; the religious fanatics who belong to the Moonie loonies and the like is another. We know that those people are not as we would like them to be; they are not like us; they probably need some help, but how we should help them is rather obscure. No doubt a significant percentage of them suffer, from time to time, with mental disorder which would bring them properly under the scope of the Act, but it is a profound mistake to include all categories of people behaving badly simply because we do not have any other answers.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07010823000006"></a>The Mental Health Act is designed, as we keep saying, to provide a check on clinical discretion and to give clear boundaries to protect against improper use. The Government believe that society in general is happy to leave decisions, such as the scope of the Act, in the hands of professional experts. I find that quite astonishing. They obviously do not know as many professionals as I do. I regret that I do not find it difficult to envisage the inappropriate use, perhaps well meant, of mental health legislation for non-medical purposes, for social convenience and control&#151;&#147;Get the paedophiles off the streets&#148;. The pressure on services to find solutions to the presently insoluble problems will be massive. Exclusions ensure that practitioners carefully consider the basis for compulsory treatment. If there is an underlying mental health diagnosis, a person is covered by the Act; if there is no diagnosis, it is unhelpful and inappropriate for the mental health services to manage that person.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07010823000007"></a>The revised definition of mental disorder is deliberately simplified and free of diagnostic categories in the Bill, so it is all the more important to be clear about the exclusions, which, after all, are a feature of the legislation in all comparable jurisdictions in the common law world, including our near neighbours Ireland and Scotland.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07010823000008"></a>I turn to sexual behaviour. When I was a trainee psychiatrist, we were obliged to learn all the ways to treat homosexuality, even though at the time many of us were horrified that it came within the scope of what we were meant to learn. Until recently, it was included in ICD 10. There is still a wide range of sexual behaviours in ICD 10 and so are many other mental phenomena which by themselves would not necessarily fall into the category of mental disorder; for example, excessive gambling and grief. Just because something is in ICD 10 does not mean that it should necessarily fall within the Act. We know that people whose sexual behaviour departs from socially acceptable norms are likely to be stigmatised. They may or may not have a mental disorder. Their behaviour may or may not be contrary to criminal law. Without this exclusion, however, people with gender dysphoria or transsexualism and, indeed, your everyday rubber fetishist will be brought within the Act as well as paedophiles.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_78"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07010823000009"></a>Forensic scientists tell us that the current exclusion criteria are important in enabling them to distinguish between those who are truly amenable to help and would warrant a detention because they have an additional mental disorder, and those who do not. From a psychiatric point of view, there is no necessity to remove the exclusion of pure disorders of sexual preference from the definition of mental disorder. As I say, the Government are obsessed with folk who do not get into treatment. This is not the right way to approach that.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07010823000010"></a>On illegal or disorderly acts and political beliefs, there should be a clear distinction between people who have a mental disorder and those whose behaviours and practices are simply unacceptable to society in general. There are, after all, lots of people who say that those young British Muslim terrorists who blew themselves and others up were mad&#151;not a far step from thinking that all people who want to see an Islamic state in Britain should be locked up in a mental hospital. It has been done elsewhere in the world, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, pointed out. Psychiatry has been abused in Nazi Germany and many other countries and, in the 1960s and 1970s, in the Soviet Union.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07010823000011"></a>I spoke to many colleagues in the Soviet Union during that time, when I was a young trainee psychiatrist and the Soviet Union&#146;s psychiatrists were excluded from the World Psychiatric Association. Most of the psychiatrists working in the Soviet Union at that time believed that they were doing the right thing&#151;there were of course those brave dissidents, many of whom managed to come here and other parts of western Europe. Most of the psychiatrists did it with the best of intentions. We must remember that. That is why they were excluded from the World Psychiatric Association; it was not imposed on them by their Government.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07010823000012"></a>The effect of not having exclusions further confuses the role of psychiatry and mental health services in the public mind, moving it from its proper aim of the assessment and treatment of mental disorder into social control. It further reduces the acceptability and, therefore, effectiveness of the services. That will have a serious impact on people from black and minority-ethnic communities, as we have already heard. I have covered the third exclusion of cultural, religious or political beliefs, and the joint scrutiny committee agreed.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07010823000013"></a>The Government are concerned with the exclusion of people with mental disorders who have unusual cultural beliefs. I cannot think why they feel that there is a risk that they will not be included, since minority cultures tend to be over-represented in those compulsorily detained. If there is a misunderstanding, it is, rather, the inverse of what the Government fear. What is their evidence on this? In their response to the scrutiny committee, the Government made the extraordinary statement that,</p>
<ul><a name="07010823000021"></a>&#147;cultural, religious and political beliefs do not constitute mental disorders, but may sometimes be symptoms of a clinically recognised mental disorder&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010823000020"></a>In other words, it is possible that you could have no delusions, hallucinations, thinking disorder, speech

That strikes me as profoundly dodgy ground.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07010823000014"></a>These amendments are to protect against inappropriate detention, and to protect professionals from being used inappropriately by society. With good training and better resources to treat people with a wide variety of disorders and ancillary problems&#151;including those the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, is talking about&#151;we should certainly be able to solve this problem. Widening the definition, however, is not the answer.</p>

The Bill rightly clarifies that dependence on alcohol or drugs is not a mental disorder that justifies compulsory treatment. By making this clear, however, it could inadvertently mean that a person with a dual diagnosis of a mental disorder and dependence on alcohol or drugs might not get the help they need under the Act. Before I go on, I must once again declare an interest: Turning Point is probably the largest provider of services to people with alcohol and drug problems outside the NHS. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, for her kind words on my amendment before she had heard me speak. That is quite nice.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07010823000016"></a>My amendment is complementary to Amendment No. 4. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that half the people in drug or alcohol services also have a mental health challenge. Around one third of patients in mental health services also have a drug or alcohol problem. My organisation works with many people who have multiple needs. We estimate that at least one in five people we support&#151;at last count we provided a service to 136,000 people&#151;with mental health challenges also need help with serious substance misuse.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07010823000017"></a>All too often, the presence of a drug or alcohol problem alongside a mental disorder is used as grounds not to treat people. They are turned away, as has been pointed out, from mental health services when they are in the greatest possible need. From our experience, people with a so-called dual diagnosis of mental health and substance misuse problems have been turned away from mental health services in the past due to the current exclusions. Consequently, people are not receiving the help they urgently need. This has consequences across the social care system. Their mental health deteriorates even further and community services endeavour to help, despite being ill equipped to do so.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07010823000018"></a>I offer an example. The Bill is often given colour when we talk about its effects on human beings. Sarah is 38 and has a diagnosis of depression and borderline personality disorder. She also has long-standing drug and alcohol difficulties and self-injures on a regular basis. When admitted for in-patient treatment, she is often put on a contract stating that she will be discharged if she self-injures or uses drugs or alcohol. These are her coping strategies; the use of alcohol or  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_80"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drugs is often a form of self-medication, a way of coping with mental health issues. So she invariably resorts to drinking or self-harm, and so she is discharged. On occasions she is not admitted at all when expressing suicidal thoughts because she has been drinking.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07010823000019"></a>Simply educating mental health staff about substance misuse will not be enough to solve this problem. While I agree with the comments about resources and training, it is not enough. The reasons why people use drugs and alcohol are complex and often misunderstood. Sometimes it can be to self-medicate and treat the symptoms of mental illness but is often interpreted as resistance to treatment or to engagement with services. It is important, if we are going to have a Mental Health Act and spend time engaged in ensuring that those in need receive treatment, that we pay attention to this group, which is a growing challenge to mental health services throughout the country. That has already eloquently been pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07010826000002"></a>I want to comment on the race issue, without repeating what has been said already here or in the joint scrutiny committee. There is considerable evidence that BME groups, particularly those from Afro-Caribbean backgrounds, are more likely to be diagnosed with a severe mental disorder. Simplified definitions where exclusions are removed increase the degree to which diagnosis of mental disorder depends on the subjective judgment of clinicians, which the literature now states with ample evidence is sometimes subject to quite racist interpretation. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Patel of Bradford can give chapter and verse on this, as chair of the Mental Health Act Commission.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07010826000003"></a>Given the evidence that racial stereotypes are significant factors underpinning notions of mental disorder, that is likely to amplify the extent to which race is a factor in defining such disorder, in effect widening the pool of people to whom legislation could be applied and who will be affected by the existing skew toward black and minority-ethnic groups, a situation made worse by amendments.</p>

It is not like physical illness; it is about the very essence of people and what they are, which is a very difficult issue.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07010826000008"></a>The issues of diagnosis, management and practical reality all come to ground in this group, as the Government have recognised by introducing a specific exclusion. Nothing in the provision says that the exclusion is on a point of principle or a particular kind of difference in terms of psychology or psychiatry. It is quite clear that dependence on alcohol and drugs involves a disorder of the mind. There is no doubt about that. There is not much doubt either that it is also similar to lots of other kinds of addictive behaviour. When treating one of these folk, often you get rid of the alcohol problem and they turn to drugs; then you get rid of the drug problem and they turn to gambling, an eating disorder or whatever.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07010826000009"></a>It is not an issue of principle, and the Government know perfectly well that if they were to include all those people as likely to be detained, the services would collapse completely because of the enormous number of people involved. It is not to do with there not being a possibility of violence; in fact, there is a much greater likelihood of violence from this group of people than from people suffering with schizophrenia. However, the Government recognise that they cannot cope. The truth is that they cannot cope with lots of the other folk they are going to bring in anyway. It is hard enough to find a bed for a psychotic young suicidal patient at the moment, and it will be even worse with a lot of these other things.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07010826000010"></a>Let us take the reason for some of the exclusions being set down here. Some are about real difficulty of diagnosis. If, for example, someone comes along and speaks about being low-spirited&#151;they are not sleeping at night, they have lost interest in a lot of their affairs and are not behaving in their usual way&#151;they might well have a depressive disorder but, of course, if their wife died three weeks ago, it would be a perfectly normal reaction to one of the vagaries of life. As my professional colleague the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, pointed out, the difficulty is that if you do not look for all of the things that are around, the diagnosis can be faulty.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07010826000011"></a>Taking personality disorder as an example, there is often a circular argument: this person is breaking the law; they do it repeatedly and do not stop; there must be something very disturbed about somebody who behaves in that way; therefore, they have a personality disorder and need to be treated. More insidiously, if the psychiatrist does not have much understanding of or sympathy for the cultural or religious background of the person involved, there is another kind of circular argument: this person has some very strange ideas; they might be religious ideas. I come from a part of the world where a lot of the religious ideas that are very current among people would be regarded as quite mad on this side of the water. I refer not just to religious ideas. One colleague came across to work in Northern Ireland, and after interviewing

When I asked why, they said, &#147;They think that if they go up this particular road they will be attacked because all sorts of people will be against them because of their religion&#148;. I said, &#147;They are not paranoid; they are realistic&#148;.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07010826000012"></a>I guarantee that the reason for the undoubted fact that many more people from Afro-Caribbean backgrounds find themselves in a mental hospital is that there is less understanding of the cultural and religious beliefs and actions of many of those people by my colleagues in psychiatry. You find a difficulty in coping with and managing someone who has a very different set of understandings of what life is about. You think, &#147;It&#146;s a bit strange. How am I going to deal with it?&#148; At present, the fastest growing special interest group in the Royal College of Psychiatrists is the spirituality group. It is not so long since there was no such group. Why? Because 10 or 15 years ago, it would not have been politically correct to regard spirituality as a proper professional interest within psychiatry. Now, people have begun to change their view of it.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07010826000013"></a>This amendment tries to point out that, without a serious look at understanding issues such as culture, politics, religion, breaking the law, sexual behaviour and so on, we could end up dragging into the net all sorts of people who are not suffering from mental illness in a proper sense and it becomes a question of how we deal with people who are difficult, different or deviant in our society. That is a real problem for colleagues in psychiatry, not least because of a move to diagnosis on the basis of people&#146;s behaviour and a set of symptoms, rather then necessarily understanding something more about the depth of the disorder and its likely prognosis.</p>

<a name="70108-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07010826000014"></a>Unfortunately, over the past few years I have heard from Ministers a set of views that suggests that there is a simplicity about all of this&#151;that it is very easy to be clear about certain matters; that clearly psychiatrists are not taking their responsibilities seriously and are avoiding all sorts of issues because they are distasteful or difficult. The reality is that these are difficult questions, not susceptible to clean bits of legislation. Psychiatrists sometimes have real difficulty assessing these things, and find themselves lapsing back into making mistakes because of their own cultural, religious, or political views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07010826000015"></a>I ask that we take these things seriously, not because Amendment No. 4 necessarily solves all the problems, but it points up some of them, and I hope that Her Majesty&#146;s Government take that problem very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07010826000017"></a>We have to give society a powerful message, not that the Bill is about locking up people who may be seen to be deviant in any sense, but that it is a mental health Bill for people who have mental health issues. Social control is another parameter in society, but we should not use psychiatry as the lever for social control, particularly not when psychiatry is dramatically under-resourced. I am worried that if the message of the Bill is that if someone expresses any of those tendencies he is more likely than previously to be locked up, then those tendencies will not be expressed to a clinician or somebody who can help, they will be expressed by being acted out and somebody will be sexually harmed or killed.</p>

My noble friend Lord Hunt mentioned earlier that, as a general rule, we have sought in the Bill to remove arbitrary obstacles to the use of compulsion where it is called for by the risk posed by a person&#146;s mental disorder. The more we qualify and limit the definition of mental disorder, the greater the risk that some people will be excluded arbitrarily to their own disadvantage and potentially to the detriment of other people. It serves no one&#146;s interests if decisions end up being taken on the basis of diagnostic or legal labels rather than the needs and circumstances of individuals.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07010826000019"></a>We recognise that these are complex issues. We are not being simplistic, and I stress that we takes these issues very seriously. In relation to alcohol and drug dependence, I do not think there is any disagreement between us. Although it is clearly clinically regarded as a disorder or disability of the mind, it is excluded from the Act at present. The Bill keeps it that way, as we are persuaded that it is not appropriate to use the Act to force people to accept treatment for addiction where it is not linked with another mental disorder.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07010826000020"></a>However, we do not agree that substance misuse in general should be excluded. The term &#147;misuse&#148; is used in a variety of ways. If all it means is the use of alcohol or of drugs that have the potential for harm or which are illicit, then the exclusion is unnecessary. Merely using alcohol or drugs is not regarded clinically as a mental disorder, and our understanding is that the same applies to an episode of misuse. However, if &#147;misuse&#148; is intended to mean the consequences of such behaviour, then we profoundly disagree with the suggestion that it be excluded. Many consequences of misuse, from acute intoxication to substance-induced psychosis and withdrawal states, are recognised mental disorders. Any of them, even intoxication in its most severe forms, might, in particular circumstances, warrant compulsory intervention under the Act. It would be wrong,  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_84"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arbitrary and to the detriment of patients to exclude such consequences. They are not excluded now, yet it is not, as far as we are aware, suggested that people are commonly, if ever, detained inappropriately as a result. If the problem is that psychiatrists fear being pressurised to detain alcohol and drug misusers inappropriately, I do not believe that that is a compelling reason for excluding people who might otherwise benefit. If they do not think detention is clinically appropriate, or patients do not meet the relevant criteria, psychiatrists should have no difficulty explaining to their colleagues that using the Act is not an option.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07010826000021"></a>The amendment next seeks to exclude sexual behaviour. If we are literally concerned with sexual behaviour, then we again believe the amendment is unnecessary. An episode of sexual behaviour, however unusual or, indeed, illegal, is not, of itself, diagnosable as a mental disorder, any more than setting fire to something constitutes pyromania. However, particular sexual behaviour may well be a sign of a mental disorder. Noble Lords have been careful to draft the exclusion in terms of no one being considered mentally disordered solely on the basis of sexual behaviour, but, even so, I worry what effect the exclusion might be interpreted to have, rightly or wrongly, in cases of people who, for example, have a personality disorder that manifests itself in their sexual behaviour.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07010826000022"></a>The noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, mentioned gender dysphoria and gender identity disorders. While we acknowledge that gender dysphoria is clinically recognised as a mental disorder, the allegation that people can now be detained because of it presupposes that it could be regarded as sexual deviance. We struggle to see who, let alone which healthcare professionals, would think of gender identity disorders in those terms. Similarly, we do not see how a new exclusion for sexual behaviour would change the position. If the exclusion is meant to protect lesbian and gay people, it is again unnecessary. It is now firmly accepted that homosexuality is no more a mental disorder than heterosexuality. We do not believe any doctor would attempt to detain a patient on the basis of sexual orientation, let alone that another doctor and an approved mental health professional would agree, and, if they did, we are confident that no court would uphold their decision.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07010826000023"></a>If, however, the intention is to replicate the current exclusion for sexual deviance, we think it is wrong in principle. Although we have heard contradictory arguments, our understanding is that there are conditions that a lay person might regard as sexual deviance that are clinically recognised as disorders of the mind. They include paraphilias such as voyeurism, necrophilia and paedophilia, where they have a significant effect on the person&#146;s functioning or pose a significant risk to others. We see no reason to distinguish those disorders from any other, and that view was shared by the Joint Committee that scrutinised the admittedly very different 2004 draft Bill.</p>

It is not at all uncommon for people of any age or either gender to achieve sexual excitement and satisfaction through partial self-asphyxiation. It is not a one-off; it is regular behaviour. It is clearly a disturbance of sexual behaviour. Such people are a risk to themselves and, from what has just been said, I cannot see how they would not therefore be liable to be compulsorily detained.

The fact that that person has what we would regard as a sexual deviancy does not mean that they have a mental disorder. It is important to remember that the criteria for detention include whether it would be appropriate for them to be treated in hospital. A clinician would decide that. If that person should be treated in hospital, clearly the clinician believes that that person has a mental disorder. If they do not believe that that is the case, they will not ask for him or her to be treated in hospital.

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07010826000029"></a>I am not aware that it is suggested that the commission, or likely commission, of illegal or disorderly acts is, by itself, a clinically recognised mental disorder. Hence, the proposed exclusion is again unnecessary. It has been suggested by noble Lords, and in the evidence cited by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that the purpose of the amendment is to prevent the Act being used for social control. If that is the case, we are fully supportive of the objective. However, the Act already achieves this objective. This is a mental health Bill; it is not about social control. We are all aware of what happened in Russia, and noble Lords have quite rightly brought  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_86"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this to our attention, but this is not what this Bill is about. The most that the proposed new words in the amendment could achieve is wrongly to suggest that, in other contexts, such behaviours would be mental disorders or, worse still, that they might place uncertainty in the minds of professionals, and even the courts, about whether behaviours of this kind can be taken into account when deciding whether someone has a mental disorder.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07010826000030"></a>Redundant material should not be included in Acts both as a matter of good drafting practice and for fear that an unintended meaning will be read into any such words. The courts will assume that Parliament would not have put material in the Act if it were unnecessary. However carefully drafted is an exclusion&#151;I know that noble Lords have been most careful in their drafting&#151;there is always the risk of it being interpreted in an unexpected way or being misunderstood and misapplied in practice. If, as in this case, an exclusion is unnecessary to start with, we think it better not to take that risk, remembering that what is at risk is whether people get the treatment they need to relieve their own suffering and, where relevant, protecting other people from harm.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07010826000031"></a>Many noble Lords understandably raised the issue of people from black and ethnic minorities being disproportionately affected by the Act. We fully acknowledge that rates of admission and detention are significantly higher for some BME groups and that they are more likely to arrive in care through the criminal justice system. Once in hospital, some groups of BME patients are more likely than white British people to be subject to measures such as seclusion or restraint. This fuels a circle of fear which deters many BME patients from seeking early treatment for their illness. We have heard many examples of that cited today. The reasons for this are complicated and still not fully understood, but the problem has effectively been left unchallenged by government for decades. Last year, we published a comprehensive, five-year action plan for delivering race equality in access to services, experience of services and outcomes from services. A high level of resources has been committed to the plan and it has made a sound start. Bridging the system of equalities once and for all might not be easy, but we cannot be satisfied with anything less.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07010826000032"></a>However, excluding cultural and religious beliefs from the definition of mental disorder is unlikely to help. It is possible of course to have disordered cultural and religious beliefs in any culture or religion, and indeed in any person, regardless of whether they see themselves as belonging to a particular culture or religion. Such beliefs may well be symptoms of clinically recognised mental disorders, but in the absence of such a disorder, political or cultural beliefs, values or opinions are simply not mental disorders. It is therefore unnecessary and potentially a source of uncertainty and misunderstanding to exclude them from the definition.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07010826000033"></a>Disordered thinking and beliefs are central elements of many mental disorders. That these are expressed in cultural, political or religious terms makes them no less disordered than if they were

But it is axiomatic that in diagnosing whether thoughts are disordered, professionals must understand them from the patient&#146;s own perspective. However strange a thought or belief may appear to be to someone else, it is not a sign of mental disorder unless it is disordered within the framework of the person&#146;s own cultural, political and religious heritage, convictions and attitudes. We therefore do not think that this needs to be said in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07010826000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, asked why the Government said that cultural beliefs could be signs of mental disorders. This is not what we said and indeed it would have been extraordinary had we done so. What we meant was that sometimes disordered thinking expresses itself in religious, political or cultural terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07010826000035"></a>In summary, Amendment No. 4 seeks to exclude various behaviours and beliefs from the definition of mental disorder. On substance misuse and sexual behaviour we disagree about the objective if those terms are meant to cover the consequences of misuse and what is currently termed &#147;sexual deviance&#148;. On the rest, we differ only as to means, not ends. Noble Lords say that it should be explicit in the Bill that it cannot be used for what some have described as social control. We say that there is simply nothing in the Bill which would allow it to be used that way. Adding unnecessary words does nothing to alter that but does increase the potential for confusion and misunderstanding in practice and the risk of an unintended meaning being read into the words by the courts.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07010826000036"></a>It is for the same reason that, while agreeing entirely with what he seeks to achieve, I cannot support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, to make explicit that dependence on alcohol and drugs does not preclude a person from treatment under the Bill if they also suffer from another mental disorder. I understand that this group of people is getting bigger.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07010826000037"></a>For the reasons the noble Lord has eloquently and colourfully explained, I agree that it is essential that people using the Act in practice are clear about what the exclusion for dependence means, and perhaps more importantly what it does not mean. We have tried to spell this out in the draft code of practice for England that we have issued alongside the Bill. But if the noble Lord does not think the current draft of the code is sufficiently clear, then of course we would welcome his suggestions for improving it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07010826000038"></a>To the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, I must stress that the Bill does not exclude people who are dependent on alcohol or drugs from the Act entirely. If such a person has another mental disorder, then of course the Act applies in the normal way. That is true even if the other mental disorder is a result of the dependence or reinforces it, or if the dependence exacerbates the other disorder or makes it harder to treat. The amendment would put into words only what is anyway the case because of the absence of

Those people, I believe, would be astonished. They are citizens of this country. It is going to apply to them. Surely the Government have got to think of their point of view.

But we have to distinguish between the democratic system in which we live and the system that existed previously in the Soviet Union, East Germany and other countries under the Soviet flag. The situation in this country is very different: we have safeguards, such as the courts and the law. We are confident that the safeguards we already have and those we are putting in place are adequate to ensure that this legislation will not be used for social control. This is a Mental Health Bill&#151;it has nothing to do with social control.</p>

When those people were locked up in mental institutions&#151;Solzhenitsyn was perhaps the classic example&#151;most of the doctors knew that what was being done was wrong. The problem for them in most cases, as it was for the directors of the institutions concerned, is that irrespective of whether they agreed or not, if they did not do it they lost their job at best and ended up as an in-patient at worst.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07010826000044"></a>What stops this happening, as my noble friend just indicated, is not the definition in the Bill but two things&#151;the rule of law, which did not exist in the

That is important because in the old bins, as they were called, and of which I have considerable knowledge from the past, the police would bring someone along who was behaving atrociously and, they thought&#151;rightly or wrong&#151;madly, throw them to the nurses who would often half-strip the person and bung him into a padded cell. Sometimes the person went free a few days later, but sometimes they stayed there for a very long time and became institutionalised. There were pluses and minuses to that, mainly an awful lot of minuses, so I was pleased when that system ended.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07010826000045"></a>What was missing then&#151;never mind the Soviet Union&#151;was the application of mental health tribunals which allow people to challenge the system. The issue is not really whether such a thing could happen, because any authoritarian Government could just lock people up if they chose to do so. However, the checks in place in a western democratic society that has the rule of law are the law itself and the pretty sophisticated mental health review tribunal approach which we have developed in recent years and which I welcome greatly. That is what prevents the system returning to what it was in the Soviet Union as well as to what was considered fairly normal here in the 1950s and earlier.</p>

The Minister&#146;s reply was not unexpected but it was disappointing. I was disappointed that none of what was said so powerfully by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, or the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, made any impact.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07010826000047"></a>The Minister took a very purist line. What we have heard in evidence from the real world, described by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, was, I hoped, enough to stall her in her tracks, but that proved to be a fond hope. What she said did not appear to me to be based on the real world; indeed, her reply to the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, seemed largely circular. She talked about not excluding people who drink habitually and have withdrawal symptoms. That is exactly the group that the Government are excluding from the Bill&#151;that is what alcohol-dependence means. The Government&#146;s position on this issue is extremely confused.</p>

<a name="70108-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07010826000048"></a>The key question is whether the Bill should be used for moral control of, for example, drunkenness, fetishism, and so on, or for the treatment of people who are ill. The Bill should be used to treat people who are ill. I was very struck by the story told by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. Twenty years ago a psychiatrist of my acquaintance asked a Russian psychiatrist whether people who tried to escape were detained in Soviet mental hospitals. The psychiatrist said yes, but only if the person was mentally ill&#151;but only a mentally ill person would try to leave the Soviet Union. That was the kind of distortion of professional ethics to be found there.</p>

It is a feature of the legislation of all Commonwealth jurisdictions that I know of for there to be exclusions; it is part of the way in which legislation that deprives people of their basic rights needs to be confined. I include in that all the Australian states, New Zealand, Ireland, Scotland and at least some of the Canadian jurisdictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07010826000050"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said that this amendment was about stopping detention creep. That is a very good way of putting it; its aim is to prevent inappropriate detention.

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07010827000004"></a>West Papua may seem far away and its problems small compared with the very grave situation in the Middle East. To its people those problems are immediate and painful, and the principles at stake are fundamental to civilised life in the modern world. The issue at the heart of this question, as in the conflict in West Papua itself, is whether a people have the right to self-determination and, if so, how we ensure that they can freely choose to exercise that right. The West Papuans are a people&#151;the same people as those of Papua New Guinea on the east of the island&#151; who obtained their independence from Britain over 30 years ago. They have no desire to be ruled from Jakarta. As a Foreign and Commonwealth Office briefing in 1969, now publicly available, put it:</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_91"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07010827000017"></a>&#147;Privately, however, we recognise that the people of West Irian (West Papua) have no desire to be ruled by the Indonesians who are of an alien (Javanese) race&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010827000005"></a>It went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="07010827000018"></a>&#147;the process of consultation did not allow a genuinely free choice to be made&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010827000006"></a>That is putting it very mildly. The so-called Act of Free Choice consisted of 1,026 people being forced at gunpoint to vote for integration with Suharto&#146;s Indonesia, and this being taken as the voice of the people.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07010827000007"></a>That this is the case is now publicly recognised by the British Government. In a historic statement to this House in answer to a Starred Question in my name, the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, who was then the Minister, acknowledged that,</p>
<ul><a name="07010827000019"></a>&#147;there were 1,000 handpicked representatives and that they were largely coerced into declaring for inclusion in Indonesia&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/04; col. 1084.]</ul>
<a name="70108-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07010827000008"></a>The question now is: what can be done to rectify this historical wrong and what is the next step? In particular, what steps are the Government taking? The policy of the Indonesian Government is to divide the country into three provinces, two of which have come into being with, in theory, a limited degree of local autonomy in each one. It has to be said plainly that this policy is not working and will not work. It is leading to increasing unrest, human rights abuses and the build-up of military forces in each of the three areas. I am afraid that it is the age-old policy of divide and rule&#151;a policy that has a particular economic dimension in West Papua, when one province has the liquid gas. It will not satisfy the West Papuan people who wish for self-determination as a people, not rule from Java through a well-funded elite and a strong military presence. Where do we go from here? I have three questions for the Government. I leave the important question of arms sales, particularly arms that can be used for internal repression, to others.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07010827000009"></a>First, will the Government take the lead in bringing this issue to the United Nations? I do not underestimate the difficulties. A number of powerful countries have strong economic ties to Indonesia, not least in the arms trade, and will be only too anxious not to make a fuss about this matter, as they were anxious not to make a fuss about it at the time of the so-called &#147;Act of Free Choice&#148; in 1969. We are, of course, one of those countries. But this Government, through the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, had the honesty to admit that what happened in 1969 was a total travesty. The Government can only enhance their reputation by carrying this issue forwards with&#151;and these are the key words&#151;a steady and consistent policy.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07010827000010"></a>The public recognition in this House in December 2004 was only a first step. To mean anything, it must be pursued. In particular, will the Government make a public commitment to support a UN-sponsored rerun of the flawed in 1969 &#147;Act of Free Choice&#148;, this time as a genuine, one-person-one-vote referendum, internationally monitored and giving the tribal peoples of West Papua the chance to choose freely between independence, free association or continued integration with Indonesia.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_92"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70108-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07010827000011"></a>Secondly, will the Government make more specific representations about the human rights abuses taking place, documented by Amnesty International? It has been estimated that, since 1969, more than 100,000 West Papuans have been killed and there are now some 9,000 refugees in Papua New Guinea. The Catholic Church's Papuan Peace and Justice Secretariat reported in June last year that students who had been arrested after a peaceful demonstration and been interviewed by their investigators had been denied access to legal representation and had suffered physical and mental torture. At present, there are more than 100 political prisoners in West Papua of whom I mention only two this evening, Filep Karma and Yusak Pakage, who were jailed for 15 and 10 years respectively for raising the West Papuan national flag&#151;the morning star&#151;on 1 December 2004, and who have been recognised by Amnesty International as political prisoners. The date of 1 December is significant because that was the day in 1961 that the Dutch granted West Papua independence, an independence which was quickly and sadly lost when Indonesia invaded the island in 1962, claiming it for themselves.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07010827000012"></a>I understand that the Government are generally monitoring the situation of political prisoners through their embassy in Jakarta, but will they specifically raise the issue of these two prisoners of conscience, Filep Karma and Yusak Pakage, with the Indonesian Government and make it clear to them that not only must they be treated humanely, but that the basis of their charge and imprisonment is totally unacceptable in any society that claims to be democratic?</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07010827000013"></a>Then, thirdly, arising from this there is the whole question of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to form political parties, freedom of access for journalists and NGOs and the importance of achieving a genuine dialogue between the Indonesian Government and the people in West Papua who wish to raise the issue of self-determination.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07010827000014"></a>At the moment the Indonesian Government lay down a pre-condition that this subject cannot even be raised in discussions. Yet that is the issue at the heart of this conflict. The West Papuans are a peace-loving people and they want to talk about what matters to them. At the moment, this is prevented by the heavy military presence and the refusal of the Indonesian authorities even to allow certain questions to be raised. Linked to this is their refusal to allow access to outsiders who raise these questions. In May of last year the UNHCR&#146;s regional representative said in evidence to an Australian Senate inquiry,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07010827000020"></a>&#147;I can confirm that, despite repeated requests, the UNHCR has not been given permission by the Government in Jakarta to have access to West Papua&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010827000015"></a>Other aid agencies and nearly all foreign journalists, as well as Amnesty International&#146;s fact-finding mission, have also been refused permission to visit.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07010827000016"></a>After its historic recognition in December 2004, I hope that the Government will pursue this matter with a steady and consistent policy in three ways: first, with a view to achieving a genuinely free vote about self-determination; secondly, by raising the

He has long championed the human rights of the people of West Papua, keeping their plight before the House and the British public for a number of years. He is to be thanked for doing so again this evening, and the least that we can do for him in this short debate is to press my noble friend the Minister to inject some urgency into efforts to address the flagrant denial of justice to the people of West Papua. The noble Lord has put forward an admirable programme and some practical suggestions. If every speaker simply does that, it might give the weight of the whole House this evening to some practical outcomes.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07010830000003"></a>As the noble Lord said, when my noble friend Lady Symons of Vernham Dean admitted in an answer to a previous debate that the 1969 Act of Free Choice was a flawed exercise, she went on to ask a simple question: &#147;What should happen now?&#148;. She gave the beginnings of an answer to her own question by suggesting that, as 35 years had passed since the flawed referendum of 1969, it would be better to look to new proposals then being put forward than to continue to harp on about ancient events. Special autonomy legislation only recently passed by the Indonesian Government would, she said, grant,</p>
<ul><a name="07010830000073"></a>&#147;70 per cent of oil and gas royalties originating in Papua&#151;as well as 80 per cent of forestry, fishery and mining royalties&#151;to the people of Papua&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/04; cols. 1084-85.]</ul>
<p><a name="07010830000004"></a>A truth and reconciliation committee had been set up to look into a number of the offences that people were complaining about. It would be best, said the noble Baroness, to see how the measures were embedding before we mapped a way forward.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07010830000005"></a>What she did not say was that, between 1969 and 2004, the same 35 years that were considered to have consigned the referendum to ancient history, there had been a massive transmigration programme that brought 1.2 million people into West Papua of Javanese and Sumatran origin, nearly all of them Muslims. That changed the nature of Papuan society and culture radically. The Indonesian Government implemented the same policies at roughly the same time in East Timor and with the same objective&#151;to change the nature and allegiances of a people who were being obstreperous and seeking their rights of self-determination. Incidentally, in Eritrea, Ethiopia attempted the same business of changing the nature of the population to achieve its ultimate goals.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07010830000006"></a>The benefits of the new legislation&#151;the special autonomy legislation&#151;would accrue not to a Papuan population at all but to one so radically different that fewer than 50 per cent of the population were the original indigenous Papuans in the first place. The

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07010830000007"></a>We have seen in the way in which Eritrea was abandoned by its United Nations overseers in the post-war period to the whims of Ethiopia a similar case of injustice. It was a United Nations set-up body that in New York allowed Indonesia to annex West Papua to itself. The Eritrean People&#146;s Liberation Army fought a long war of attrition to attain its rightful status, and I was present on the day of the referendum in 1993 when, with great jubilation, at last the Eritrean people felt that they had gained their objective despite the opposition of the international community; so, too, the Free Papua Movement may be counted on to maintain its opposition to the present arrangements and to seek the support of the world community in achieving its legitimate objectives.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07010830000008"></a>The 1969 Act of Free Choice was both cynical and wrong. It involved about 1,000 hand-picked people; a significant number of them were tribal leaders who were rounded up a month before the referendum and indoctrinated so that they would vote as they were obliged to, at gunpoint, on the day of the referendum. The voting exercise was overseen by, of all people, the Indonesian army, mainly. There were a couple of objective overseas observers, but they left before the vote was completed. All responsible commentators agree with that analysis. No amount of truth and reconciliation will hide or play down that basic fact.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07010830000009"></a>Indonesia has been seen by all the major players in the West as an important bastion against communism. The United States has played a significant part in seeing the outcomes that we are discussing this evening come to pass, but our own country is associated with it and so is Australia. Even the Vatican, because of the significant number of powerful Roman Catholics in the Indonesian republic, has preferred to turn a blind eye to some of these questions on the margin of its consideration.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07010830000010"></a>In view of that, we must ask ourselves how we implement an ethical foreign policy towards this small region. The question will not go away; it did not do so in Eritrea or East Timor, nor will it in West Papua. I hope that my noble friend will help her colleagues in government to show a preferential option to those suffering injustice, as this is a case clamouring for appropriate attention.</p>

Any unlawful usurpation should evoke condemnation if international law is not to be brought into disrepute, but here there has been persecution, murder, evictions and burning of the villages of innocent human beings, while the world has looked on. Surely that will reflect opprobrium on our generation from those who come after us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07010830000012"></a>We could debate at length the precise criteria for the right of a people to self-determination. Those debates go back to the League of Nations, but today we are spared legal hair splitting. Here, there is a population of 800,000 people, racially differentiated from the population of Indonesia, with its own history, culture, and inhabiting a clearly defined territory, yet ruled by an alien administration which by a persistent policy of repression and terror has made itself hated and feared.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07010830000063"></a>We have every criterion for the right to self-determination. The principle is declared in Article 1.2 of the United Nations charter and further enshrined in the two human rights covenants of 1966. There is clear consensus that two principles follow. First, the right includes the right of a people to decide how to exercise its choice. It is for the people to decide who their delegates are to be and what the decision-making process is to be. They are entitled to do that free from any pressures, internal or external, after such free discussions as their choice may require. Secondly, the right is continuing and not exhausted once it has been exercised, validly or otherwise. A right to choose entails a right to make continuing choices as circumstances change or simply if there is a change of mind. A third principle, while we are passing, is that the right includes a right to enjoy the natural resources of the area and to decide how they are to be developed and exploited. Article 1.2 of the international economic covenant reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07010830000069"></a>&#147;All peoples may, for their own end, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010830000064"></a>subject, of course, to existing obligations.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07010830000013"></a>The situation has a shamefully long drawn-out history of which the international community has no reason to be proud. In 1949, the Netherlands Government conceded independence to Indonesia, but vast areas had been included in the territory purely for the purposes of administration and not by any stretch of the imagination because they were a natural part of Indonesia. The Indonesian Government said that the newly acquired statehood should extend throughout that territory. The Netherlands Government said that the peoples of West Irian were entitled to decide whether they should be included in the new state or whether they should have some other status.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07010830000014"></a>Up to that point, the Papuan people had not been invited to participate in the discussions. The Netherlands said that the issue should be decided by the United Nations. Indonesia said that it was an internal matter, not the concern of the international community, and that it should be resolved by negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands, which clearly would never eventuate in an agreement. Nevertheless, the General Assembly discussed the question in 1954 and again in 1961 but was unable to agree on a resolution. It is worth pointing out that in those debates West Papua had no representation&#151;it had no seat in the General Assembly.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07010830000015"></a>On 31 December 1961, West Papua achieved a very short-lived independence. The Indonesian Government terminated it unilaterally by military  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_96"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>force. In 1962, Indonesia and the Netherlands reached the New York agreement, which was designed to resolve the issue. The Netherlands would transfer administration of West Papua to a United Nations Temporary Executive Authority established by and answerable to the Secretary-General. It was said that arrangements would be put in place for the people of West Irian to choose in accordance with international practice and with the participation of all adults, male and female. That agreement was approved by the General Assembly, so it was accepted by all concerned that the population of West Papua was a separate and identifiable people entitled to self-determination. I hope that, in replying, my noble friend will clarify whether the Government accept that conclusion or, if not, why not.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07010830000016"></a>The outcome of such a choice was predictable. We now know that John Kennedy&#146;s ambassador reported 85 to 90 per cent of the population as being in sympathy with the Free Papua Movement. That outcome would have left Indonesia, as my noble friend Lord Griffiths said, blaming the West. The United States was concerned that if Indonesia turned to the communist bloc there would be an outpost of communism in east Asia. The Temporary Executive Authority proved to be very temporary. It was persuaded by the United States to acquiesce in the assumption of control by the Indonesian Government. That was fatal to any hope of a fair entitlement. It led to the infamous Act of Free Choice about which both noble Lords have already spoken, and I will not repeat that. It has been condemned by international lawyers and by other authorities again and again.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07010830000017"></a>There the situation rests. The Indonesian Government introduced the special autonomy law in 2001, as my noble friend Lord Griffiths pointed out, but there has been no autonomy, and the atrocities go on. As all too often, the persecution, the murders and the incarcerations will continue for as long as the protest continues, and that will continue as long as the situation remains as it is. Any form of international action can take place only if it is initiated by a national Government. The United Kingdom Government still carry respect and influence in these matters. The question is whether they retain their dedication to an ethical foreign policy. I am sure that I know the answer that my noble friend would like to give; many of us are looking forward to hearing the answer that she is authorised to give.</p>

There were many reasons for wanting to intervene; perhaps the whole issue of human rights, to which the noble Lord referred, would be sufficient in itself. We have a Government who claim that they want to see a world based on human rights, accountable government and democracy. They want to play a full part in working towards that world. It logically follows, therefore, that we have an interest in the injustice of the situation in West Papua.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07010830000019"></a>I am afraid that I see in the situation too many sinister and ominous parallels with East Timor. I have visited Indonesia on a number of occasions, and I visited East Timor in the final stage, just before the terrible conflict that led to independence. The people of that part of the world are wonderful; they deserve more than they are enjoying.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07010830000020"></a>Sometimes in debates of this kind we become a bit theoretical and remote in our analysis, and I therefore am not ashamed to bring to the attention of the House a letter that was brought to my attention fairly recently. It is an open letter written by Benny Wenda, the chairman of the Koteka Tribal Assembly and the leader of the West Papua Independence Movement, to the Indonesian ambassador in Britain, who had apparently expressed surprise that West Papua was seeking independence. This letter, written with some passion, was to tell him why. In the letter, Benny Wenda referred first to what we have already heard about the invasion of their land. He then referred to the referendum that was offered as a so-called act of free choice, which in fact was in the context of the ruthless intimidation of those who were likely to vote for independence. Then there was the removal of people to make way for the exploitation of gold, copper, oil and timber reserves. Again, ruthless techniques were employed, such as bombing from helicopters. People were rendered homeless, raped and murdered; all this was part of what happened.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07010830000021"></a>Perhaps I can quote directly from the letter, which is passionate and written with real feeling:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07010830000070"></a>&#147;Then you started to rip open and destroy our Land. We call our Land our Mother because she gives us everything we need to live. You sold our Mother to British, American &amp; Australian companies like Rio Tinto &amp; BP. You got rich whilst we West Papuans got poorer, not because we want your kind of riches, but because without our Mother we die&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010830000065"></a>He concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="07010830000071"></a>&#147;Now you say that we are &#145;free and equal citizens of the new Indonesian democracy&#146;. But when we tell you we want to use this &#145;new free democracy&#146; to campaign democratically and peacefully for independence and when we just want to see our own flag flying in our own Sky, you cover our Land with soldiers, you put us in prison, you torture us and you kill us&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010830000022"></a>I have no first-hand experience by which I can assess these accusations, but I have the experience of visits to Indonesia and to East Timor and I am afraid that the accusations ring all too true to me.</p>

<a name="70108-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07010830000023"></a>Obviously, it is not convincing to contemplate a world in which every ethnic group has a national identity of its own. That would make neither political nor economic sense. But consent is essential if countries are to stand together in meaningful democracy and freedom, and consent depends on trust. Where trust is absent&#151;and it seems to be totally absent in this case&#151;consent can hardly be expected. The genie is out of the bottle.</p>

Of course there are also more tangible reasons for our responsibility, including the importance of the economic relationship between Britain and Indonesia, not least through arms sales, which indirectly compound the situation that we are describing. I hope that the Government will take the noble Lord&#146;s entreaties seriously and can come to a candid relationship with Indonesia in which realistic talk takes place about the way forward.</p>

The right of self-determination, while undoubtedly a legal right, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, pointed out, is a matter of state practice in the absence of any rules for determining how it should be enforced. Therefore, is there any point now in reviewing the events that led up to the so-called act of free choice?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07010830000027"></a>In the cases of Srebrenica and Rwanda, there were formal inquiries into how those appalling tragedies were allowed to happen. The Secretary-General himself took responsibility for investigating the Srebrenica massacre, in which an estimated 20,000 people were slaughtered by the Serbian militias. However, as two noble Lords have pointed out, in West Papua something like 100,000 people have been killed since the Indonesian occupation&#151;five times as many as in Srebrenica&#151;yet the UN has failed to review the conduct of the bogus operation carried out under its auspices that led to this enormous tragedy.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07010830000028"></a>When I asked the Government six years ago whether they considered that an independent audit of the UN&#146;s role should be commissioned, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said that she was satisfied that the study being conducted by the Institute of Netherlands History would serve that purpose. That report, by Professor Pieter Drooglever, was published in November 2005 and, as has already been said, it confirms that the outcome had been pre-determined by Suharto, who had issued instructions that nothing but a ruling in favour of Indonesia would be acceptable. The UN observers were allowed to see as little as possible and were ejected from the territory immediately after the so-called vote.</p>

<ul><a name="07010830000074"></a>&#147;advise, assist and participate in&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010830000066"></a>the arrangements for the act of free choice, which was to be carried out,</p>
<ul><a name="07010830000075"></a>&#147;in accordance with international practice&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07010830000067"></a>That was immediately violated by the UN itself, which failed to organise a plebiscite and, instead, agreed that the decision would be made by an assembly, whose members would be indirectly elected by an undefined electorate. As we have heard, the Indonesians chose the 1,000-odd candidates, all of whom were elected unopposed in batches, with the so-called &#147;voters&#148; browbeaten or bribed into approving them by acclamation. UN observers saw the elections of 195 of these stooges but, significantly, their report to the General Assembly was silent on the conduct of the operation.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07010830000030"></a>By that time, the UN team had been whittled down to a mere 16 members at the insistence of the Indonesians, and it would have been impossible for it to fulfil its remit, even with full co-operation, in a territory the size of California with only the most primitive transport and communication systems. However, members of the team did not complain when no interpreters were provided or when they had to ask permission every time they wanted to move outside the capital. They failed to blow the whistle when they saw Indonesian soldiers and officials pouring into the territory in far larger numbers than planned and exerting heavy pressure on the Papuans to choose integration and give up the dream of self-determination.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07010830000031"></a>That fraudulent process was endorsed by the General Assembly with the approval of the UK. The Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office had recommended not entering into correspondence about self-determination, and in the UN we firmly supported the betrayal of the West Papuans, not on grounds of principle but out of solidarity with the Dutch and as a means of improving our relations with the military dictator General Suharto, who had done a splendid job exterminating half a million communists and was therefore a man to be encouraged.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07010830000032"></a>The Government may not seek to persuade the UN that there should be a rerun, as the noble Lord, Lord Harries, called it, of what happened in 1969, but they should at least seek an opportunity to get the Drooglever report upheld and endorsed by the General Assembly, and that is what I ask the Minister to agree to. In other cases where the UN has failed to uphold the rights of peoples, it has recorded and acknowledged its appalling mistakes and their tragic consequences. Will the Minister agree that the act of free choice cries out for the same treatment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07010830000034"></a>Unfortunately, although President Megawati made offers of special autonomy to Aceh and West Papua in 2001, there has been a complete divergence between the fortunes of the two provinces since then. In Aceh, a peace agreement was concluded in 2005 and successful elections have now been held there. Could not the lessons of that peaceful outcome be transferred to West Papua in principle&#151;not in detail but, as has been suggested, at least by starting negotiations towards an outcome similar to that in Aceh? The present deployment of extra troops and paramilitary police is not the answer, any more than it was in Aceh. We should be saying respectfully to Indonesia that a framework is needed for negotiating a political settlement, building on the experience of Aceh, although perhaps involving not just the OPM but representatives of all the diverse communities in West Papuan society, including civil society, traditional tribal leaders, the church and the MRP. If we can ask for that, we shall be getting somewhere.</p>

I hope that the Minister will be able to comment on these very concerning claims in her response. No doubt she recognises, as did the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that some nationalist groups fear that Papua could become the next East Timor. That has a significant bearing on today's debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="07010830000037"></a>Papua, a name adopted in 2002, is currently a province of Indonesia. It refers to what some of your Lordships might remember from days at school as the region known as Dutch, New Guinea during the colonial era. Papua&#151;nee Irian Jaya&#151;became a province of Indonesia following a UN Supervised Act of Free Choice in 1969, the legitimacy of which, as the noble Lords, Lord Harries and Lord Griffiths, have already highlighted, remains disputed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07010830000038"></a>As your Lordships are aware, West Papua was the major beneficiary of a nation-wide decentralisation process started in 1999 and the special autonomy status introduced in early 2002. Measures included the formation of the Papuan People's Council and redistribution of resource revenues. Those measures were welcomed but we are frustrated and disappointed, along with many Members of your Lordships' House, by the continuing failure regarding the implementation of the special autonomy law. We on these Benches believe that the full implementation will lay the groundwork for a long-term resolution to the growing crisis in West Papua and will offer

What recent steps have Her Majesty&#146;s Government taken to encourage the Indonesian Government to proceed with the special autonomy law? Can the Minister inform the House whether the Prime Minister raised the issue during his visit to the country last year?</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07010830000039"></a>We could not have had a debate today without mentioning the human rights situation in Indonesia. There can be no doubt that it has dramatically improved, for which the administration should be commended. However, there is still a very long way to go. Significant concerns continue to surround violations by the Indonesian armed forces, restrictions on access to Papua for journalists and NGOs and a number of cases where prisoners have been convicted for treason for displaying the Papuan flag. Many of your Lordships will find it very difficult to consider that Filep Karma and Yusak Pakage have been jailed now for 15 and 10 years respectively for peacefully raising the independence flag, and yet army officers convicted of involvement in the murder of the Theys Eluay, the independence leader, in 2001, received only three years. What steps are Her Majesty&#146;s Government taking to ensure that there will be a public debate regarding the human rights issues in Indonesia and in particular guaranteed open access for NGOs and journalists? What consideration has the Minister given to the calls for the Papuan People&#146;s Council to be fully involved with the central Government of Indonesia in working towards an acceptable solution?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07010830000040"></a>This has been a most interesting and detailed, if specialised, debate. As my right honourable friend William Hague said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07010830000072"></a>&#147;We have the privilege of living in freedom. But with that privilege comes the responsibility to use our liberty to speak up for those who are denied it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010830000068"></a>It is important to consider West Papua within both its historical and current context, as much as we have great sympathy with many of the concerns raised today&#151;indeed, we share some. However, we do not believe that meaningful dialogue with the Government of Indonesia can take place on the basis of calls for Papuan independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07010830000041"></a>We support the UK Government in respecting the territorial integrity of Indonesia. We are not calling for the independence of Papua, but for an open, inclusive and frank discussion and the full implementation of the special autonomy law. We value our good relationship with Indonesia but we believe that it is dragging its feet on this issue. The Government could and should press harder to find, through dialogue, a peaceful, just and dignified resolution.</p>

Like the vast majority of other international players, we respect Indonesia&#146;s territorial integrity and have never supported Papuan independence. I note the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Harries, that the people of West Irian have no desire to be part of Indonesia. I respectfully point out that voter turnout of over 70 per cent in the elections last March perhaps suggests that they are becoming a little more content with the situation.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07010830000044"></a>The best way to resolve the complex issues in Papua is through promoting peaceful dialogue between Papuan groups and the Indonesian Government. Meaningful dialogue with the Government of Indonesia cannot take place on the basis of preconditions of Papuan independence. President Yudhoyono has said that he is committed to a just, comprehensive and dignified solution, including through consistent implementation of special autonomy. We welcome this important objective, and encourage him to press ahead with it. The special autonomy legislation is enshrined in Indonesian law, and was supported by Papuan groups and the international community. Full implementation of the legislation will lay the groundwork for a sustainable resolution to the internal differences and the long-term stability of the province. The UK is of course also committed to improving the well-being and political participation of Papuan people, as well as encouraging freedom of expression throughout Indonesia.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="07010830000045"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell cited the economic covenant, and many others have referred to the special autonomy legislation on oil and forestry revenue. The special autonomy legislation grants Papua 70 to 80 per cent of the royalties from natural resources rather than the tax revenue. Papua is receiving this and, to make up for the fact that it receives none of the tax revenue, the central Government pay 2 per cent more than to other provinces in Indonesia under devolution. In 2006, it received $438 million, higher than every other province in Indonesia bar one.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07010830000046"></a>My noble friend Lord Griffiths of Burry Port referred to special autonomy issues. Many such issues still need to be implemented in the legislation, but progress is being made; for example, the establishment of the Papuan People&#146;s Council and the election of a provincial governor. Legislation has been, or is in the process of being, approved on the use of Papuan symbols&#151;essentially the flag and certain anthems&#151;the special autonomy budget, forestry issues, protection of customary rights, health and education. Of course, there is much more to be done and we will keep pressing them to do so.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07010830000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Harries, asked if the Government would support a review of the Act of Free Choice. If your Lordships will forgive me, I have lost that section of my papers, so I will come back to it shortly because I have something to say on that.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07010830000048"></a>We are working with the Indonesian Government to support the most pressing economic and social needs of the Papuan people. Under Indonesia&#146;s decentralisation laws, Papua&#146;s directly elected  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_103"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>governors and district heads have significant political and fiscal authority. The central Government have devolved control over every area but five to Papua: foreign affairs, defence and security, fiscal and monetary policy, religious affairs and justice. The UK, through the multi-donor decentralisation support facility and other projects, is working to build administrative capacity and ensure that these local Papuan governments are accountable to the people that they serve.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07010830000049"></a>I return to the Act of Free Choice. Although we recognise that it was extremely flawed, the UK has no plans to support a review of that Act. We believe that is a matter for the Netherlands and the UN. As the 1962 New York agreement was between the Dutch and Indonesian Governments, and the UN oversaw the 1969 Act, we have little locus to question the legality of either. The 2001 special autonomy law allows the establishment of a truth and reconciliation committee to look at the incorporation of Papua into Indonesia in the 1960s, which we believe indicates that the Indonesian Government recognise the need to address the long-standing problems in Papua.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="07010830000050"></a>I think that my noble friend Lord Judd mentioned transmigration. Non-Papuan migrants make up about 35 per cent of the total population. However, in 2000 the Indonesian Government ended the transmigration programme in response to concerns about the ethnic mix. Spontaneous migrants continue to arrive in relatively large numbers, but there is no government programme to increase the number of non-ethnic Papuans in the region. I suggest that the special autonomy programme is therefore relevant to the lives of most West Papuans.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="07010830000051"></a>DfID is closely involved in formulating the governor&#146;s development strategy, which will focus on the millennium development goals. DfID is looking to align its own funding for Papua with the governor&#146;s vision. The DfID-funded multi-stakeholder forestry programme has been working to improve land use in Papua, by supporting detailed mapping and informed policy change. Papua is also a key area of focus for DfID&#146;s HIV/AIDS programme, working through the Indonesian partnership fund for HIV/AIDS. Other donors are also engaged in Papua to improve conditions on the ground.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="07010830000052"></a>The UK is also working in a number of areas to promote dialogue and improve political participation in Papua. UK-funded human rights projects in Papua include funding for the Indonesian human rights commission&#151;to travel to remote areas of Papua to investigate alleged human rights violations&#151;public education about rights regarding treatment by the police, human rights training for the police and providing a police complaints post.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="07010830000053"></a>In respect of human rights, we do indeed have an interest, and I hear what your Lordships, including my noble friend Lord Judd, have said about the human rights situation in Papua. We believe that the human rights situation in Papua too is improving. There is little credible information to suggest that major systematic abuses of human rights are currently taking place, although I hear what the noble  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_104"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column 104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Baroness, Lady Rawlings, said. The major concerns are chronic low-level harassment, freedom of expression and association, and social and economic rights&#151;as in other areas of eastern Indonesia. Of course, we will continue to take reports of human rights violations seriously; we raise these with the Indonesian Government, together with our European partners and as part of our bilateral dialogue. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, we will certainly make representations to the German presidency to resume the troika idea.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07010830000054"></a>Several Jakarta-based correspondents, including representatives of the BBC and the <I>Washington Post</I>, received permission to visit Papua in 2006, including sensitive areas in the central highlands. We welcome this increased access for journalists. We regularly encourage the Indonesian Government to permit journalists to visit Papua to promote better international understanding of conditions within the provinces.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07010830000055"></a>The noble Lord rightly raised the case of Filep Karma and Yusak Pakage who were shamefully imprisoned in 2005 for flying a flag identified with the separatist struggle. The Indonesian Government have obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and their own constitution to guarantee freedom of expression throughout Indonesia. We encourage the Indonesian Government to implement those obligations. As the noble Lord suggested, our embassy in Jakarta is monitoring the case; it will look into it further and make representations, if appropriate.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07010830000056"></a>Several noble Lords mentioned that 100,000 people were killed. There were certainly brutal operations in Papua in the 1970s, which we deeply regret and condemn, but we believe that there is nothing to substantiate the figure of 100,000 people, but even if it were &#147;only&#148; 10,000, that is 10,000 too many. We continue to take reports of human rights violations seriously.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="07010830000057"></a>Papua is one of the wealthiest provinces in Indonesia in fiscal terms. However, most Papuans do not see the benefits of that wealth. Papua is the province with the highest level of poverty&#151;40 per cent of Papuans live below the poverty line&#151;and health, education and infrastructure are consistently below the national average. Much of that discrepancy can be put down to corruption, which is serious and endemic at the local government level. The UK&#146;s projects to build local government capacity, which I described earlier, aim to improve that. We welcome the fact that, at the urging of the new governor, Papua&#146;s provincial budget is now being scrutinised by the national anti-corruption commission.</p>

<a name="70108-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="07010830000058"></a>I heard noble Lords&#146; graphic descriptions. Papua is in many ways the last blot on Indonesia&#146;s global reputation. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, the situation in Aceh has improved, and perhaps that can be built on. The UK Government believe that the best way forward for Papua and its people is through peaceful dialogue between representatives of the Papuan people and the Indonesian Government and the implementation of the special autonomy law of 2001. We will do all we can to support that process,

Participation in an election does not imply acceptance of the constitutional position.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000008"></a>Clause 1 [<I>The national concession</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="07010813000009"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010813000274"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> We seek not to oppose the Bill but to improve it and to make it more useful without adding inordinately to the expense to the Government of the new legislation. This very long list of amendments deals with smartcards. The Bill talks about permits as the means by which people obtain access to bus services at no charge. We believe that permits are very outdated technology, and the opportunity should be taken to convert the permit currently in use in most places to a smartcard. This is worth doing for several reasons. It would reduce the opportunities for fraudulent use by passengers, by bus operators or by bus drivers.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000010"></a>More importantly, there is a need to obtain the maximum amount of useful and accurate information about bus journeys so that the subsidy available is accurately targeted. By subsidy, I mean all the public funding of bus services, and particularly the bus service operators&#146; grant, which was formerly known as the fuel-duty rebate. The question of how the fuel-duty rebate might be replaced has been investigated at least twice&#151;I think it has been investigated more often&#151;on the assumption that the fuel-duty rebate, or the bus service operators&#146; grant, is paid for the mileage operated, when we are in fact trying to subsidise people for carrying passengers. All attempts at reform have failed because of the considerable obstacle of very little reliable information about passenger mileage, and because any other way of making the information available would be bureaucratic and expensive to administer.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000011"></a>The introduction of smartcards, which are held by the passenger, and the necessary smartcard readers on buses would provide the opportunity to target the subsidy very accurately on the passenger carried. The smartcard is intelligent and, if necessary, would enable the facility of free travel to be available at particular times. Governments of whatever colour would find themselves paying for useful outputs rather than generalised inputs. That is a practical consideration in the targeting of a subsidy, whatever you are subsidising. You want to subsidise the benefit rather than the input.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000012"></a>That is why I have moved this series of amendments. They provide for the use of smartcards and the provision on buses of smartcard readers. I should also make it clear that it may be necessary to pay for the equipment needed by bus operators. But,  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>having put all this in place, a plethora of information would become available to government. Further, smartcards should be ITSO-compliant to a national standard that should apply throughout Britain and probably elsewhere in due course.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000013"></a>What is the Government&#146;s attitude towards smartcards? I am not proposing that we would all have smartcards by April 2008 because I realise that that is impossible, but is it the Government&#146;s wish or even their intention&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07010813000014"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07010813000275"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b> I apologise for interrupting the noble Lord. Could we have quiet in the Room, please?</p>

<p><a name="07010813000015"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010813000276"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b>&#151;to move towards a smartcard system once the technical problems have been ironed out? I have been told today&#151;I did not know this before&#151;that a good time to do this would be 2010 because that is when the present London Freedom Passes, of which I have two examples with me, expire. At that point it will be necessary to replace all the current London smartcards, which constitute a high proportion of the passes issued in England as a whole.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000016"></a>Without the introduction of this new technology, not only will it prove difficult to abolish the bus service operators&#146; grant, it will also be difficult to reimburse local transport authorities fairly and accurately what they spend on subsidising bus travel. Although she is currently detained because her mother is unwell, that is a subject to which my noble friend Lady Scott of Needham Market will return because there is a problem with the present system in that money is distributed through the block grant to local transport authorities in a rather crude fashion. Some have enough money; some have too much, but we do not hear from them; some have too little, and from them we hear a lot. That is the way with any form of grant distribution, but I am moving this series of amendments because I really want to hear about the Government&#146;s intentions and we can return to this subject once I have heard from the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000017"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07010813000277"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> In general I support the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. However, first I want to wish the Minister a happy new year. We are going to be talking a lot in the coming months so we should start on a good note. Although I know I should not do it too much, I shall draw on my position as leader of Essex County Council when speaking to these amendments.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000018"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has said, much of this concerns capturing accurate data in order actually to deliver a smartcard. While we all support the aims of this legislation, the timescale for the Government to deliver it is tight and I want to offer them some help by explaining what is already happening in Essex. I do so because I agree totally with the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, that smartcards are the long-term answer and we need to develop this system. It is the obvious way to stop misuse of this legislation, and to have effective administration and control of public expenditure.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000019"></a>I would like to say what happens in Essex. Essex County Council co-ordinates a very effective concessionary fares scheme. It involves 12 district councils and a unitary authority&#151;1.6 million people. We are developing considerable relationships with some of the leading experts in intelligent transport systems around the world; so we have already done a lot of work on it. We have established a forward programme of work that will easily be adapted to smartcard technology. We are demonstrating a project in Essex that could be rolled out nationwide. We are adjacent to London and are likely to work with London on it.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000020"></a>We were going to come on to this later, but there was a suggestion that the Secretary of State might need to operate the scheme nationally. I suggest that local authorities could develop&#151;and I am happy to volunteer Essex to pilot the scheme&#151;a smartcard regime that could be operated by local authorities nationally. You could have an identical card with different logos. The south-west, the north-west, Manchester or London could have different logos on the same sort of card. We have already made progress on this. We are developing it. We have all sorts of contacts around the world regarding what is happening and contacts with companies developing this. This is probably not the appropriate time, but we could pass on our developments and volunteer our help in turning it into a national scheme. That is my contribution to this part of the discussion. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say to that.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000021"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010813000278"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I begin by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, for his best wishes for the new year, which I reciprocate. I am glad to see that he is starting off in a most constructive vein. He has partly made my case on the amendments by indicating that there is much work still to be done on the development of the eventual smartcard ticketing that is required, but I am very grateful to him for his constructive suggestion. It may well be that the department takes it up. Certainly, we have a considerable amount to do.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, was generous enough to say that 2010 would be an appropriate time by which to have a fully operational smartcard. I cannot give him that assurance, but I recognise the significance of the date. I am only too eager to facilitate any help he needs with his particular cards.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000023"></a>I want to emphasise that I understand that on the whole these are probing amendments. I reassure the Committee that the Government regard the aim of the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, as entirely laudable. We are entirely supportive of these proposals, but do not think that the amendments are necessary or desirable.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000024"></a>The Bill makes provision for the specification of the permit in regulations; so we will be able, entirely properly, to use secondary legislation to implement the nature of the fully fledged national scheme on smartcard principles&#151;possibly after the help of Essex local authority and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, if that proves to be an illustration of how this can be done, or possibly through other routes.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, did not want to pre-empt future debates, but he made reference to the fact that the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to take responsibility for all this if necessary. I want to reassure the Committee that we have this objective in mind. Equally clearly, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, was perceptive enough to recognise that if we made this a requirement of the legislation our target date of 2008 would be unrealisable.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000026"></a>No one in this Committee, no one who spoke at Second Reading and no one in the country would want to see a delay in implementing this wholly beneficial measure because of substantial technical problems in introducing the most desirable form of permit, which is a smartcard. Nevertheless, in the Bill we indicate that one of the bases is the permit, because that is the concept with which we have to work at present. It is an all-embracing concept, and one that is readily transformable into the smartcard. I assure the Committee that we will work towards those objectives as rapidly as we can, and that we are at one with the spirit behind them. I think it will be recognised, however, that if we accepted the amendments, which are numerous but follow the same theme, that could lead to difficulties with regard to early implementation of this legislation. We are not prepared to do that.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000027"></a>I emphasise that we are not fixed in our views on how to arrive at the desired state. We are mindful of the fact that there are many players in this situation, not least, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has reminded us, the local authorities, who play a significant role. Although we will discuss later whether the Secretary of State might be empowered to implement the scheme, we also recognise that there is much merit in working through existing schemes and existing local authorities and establishing best practice as the basis for the nation. By &#147;the nation&#148;, in this case, I am referring to England, as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland already have their schemes.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000028"></a>I could go into a great deal of technical detail in explaining to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, why I could not accept each of the amendments at present, but that would be otiose when we are discussing the desirable principle upon which these permits should be implemented. I give the obvious rider that we could not possibly introduce the scheme in 2008 on the basis of smartcard principles, but we intend to work towards those objectives as early as possible. The Bill provides the permissive framework, subject to the will of Parliament, whereby we will be able to implement the most desirable form of smartcards at the earliest possible time. I hope the noble Lord will accept, in the spirit of that response, that he can safely withdraw his amendments today.</p>

We have all been involved in technology, and we know we cannot always deliver quite as quickly as we might like; schemes do not always get off the ground quickly. But as we take the Bill through different processes, it would be helpful if, before Report, the Minister could say that the Government will work with local authorities to see what is going on. We have come back to this question about the Secretary of State. That might have an effect on how the noble Lord and I react at a later stage. That work could be utilised and capitalised on to develop a national scheme, which we all support, rather than saying that we will start all over again. I am sure the Minister&#146;s civil servants are talking to local authorities, and it would be useful to co-ordinate and pull all that work together.</p>

I understand that we will be discussing the Bill at subsequent stages as well, but in so far as it is within my power to allay anxieties on this front, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that the department is of course fully aware of the sophisticated nature of some local authority schemes, which have cracked some of these problems in certain areas. He will also recognise that we are talking about a multiplicity of different authorities with very different perspectives on how this all works. Consequently, we have to carry out substantial consultation, but I assure the noble Lord that the department regards this exercise as one for which local authority consultation is essential, particularly given the successful work that they have carried out on this.</p>

I suggest that one way in which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and I could be assured that matters would progress would be an early move to advertising in the European journal. That would be necessary in the provision of a smartcard system and would indicate to us that the Government were moving forward with the issue. This is a long process, but there are, as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, many suppliers out there which would be keen to be involved. It would reassure us to hear that the first small step had been taken.</p>

<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000037"></a>The noble Lord said: This important set of amendments would, first, extend the current scheme to other forms of transport, including buses, the underground, tramways and ferries, both inside and outside London. Secondly, it would abolish the time restrictions that are currently in place. In short, we are probing why the Bill has been drafted to include only buses and time restrictions, which we may discuss at some length.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000038"></a>It is clear that certain groups of disabled and elderly people would benefit greatly from the application of concessions to a wider range of transport modes. For example, people with autism prefer to use door-to-door services because they often have difficulty in judging road safety and can experience anxiety on scheduled bus transport services, especially when routes and timetables are frequently changed. The difficulty in accessing the higher mobility rate of disability living allowance for some disabled people means that door-to-door transport is currently not an option for them, because of the additional costs associated with its use. In some areas, concessionary fare passes can already be used in taxis, community transport and other door-to-door transport. That is particularly important in rural areas.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000039"></a>In Scotland, many ferry journeys are also covered by the concessionary fares scheme in recognition of the local transport services that ferries provide between the Scottish islands and the mainland. We heard much about that at Second Reading. We would encourage the same approach for similar services throughout the UK. In urban areas, concessions are often available to be used on local rail and light railway services. This is important when train and tram services are used for local journeys as an alternative to buses.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000040"></a>The second set of amendments in this group would allow travel at any time, both inside and outside London. Restriction of concessionary travel during morning peak periods has a severely detrimental effect on disabled people travelling to or looking for work. That is the strongest issue raised by these amendments. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Low, will follow me, but his organisation, the Royal National Institute of the Blind, has suggested that only 27 per cent of blind and partially sighted people of working age are in employment&#151;and that where people are employed, they are more likely to be in lower-paid jobs. I do not like to keep citing the situation in my own county but, in Chelmsford, where we now have only about 1 per cent unemployment, we would like to get many more disabled people back into work. Allowing them to use transport at peak times would be very helpful in enabling that to happen.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000041"></a>Access to Work is often incorrectly thought to be an alternative to concessionary fares but this support is only available to disabled people who are unable to use existing transport. That is why I feel very strongly about this matter. In addition, disabled people often need to travel early for medical appointments, education and leisure and, indeed, because it is easier for them to access less crowded places. That is another reason for reconsidering the timings.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000042"></a>It is pleasing to note that the Bill would not prevent local authorities from continuing to offer concessions which are more generous than the statutory minimum. However, as the Government have improved the minimum concessionary fare scheme for older and disabled people, some local authorities have reduced their existing schemes to the statutory minimum. For example, pressure has been put on a number of schemes which provided free morning peak travel for blind people but not for older and disabled people. There needs to be some  clear statement from the Government as to their philosophy and policy on this matter.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000043"></a>When this issue arose in London, the Association of London Government, as it was then, extended free travel to all disabled people in the morning peak. There have been no time restrictions on using the Freedom Pass in the morning peak in London on buses, the Underground and the DLR since April 2003. This has not caused many difficulties despite the huge pressure on public transport in London at that time. The Scottish and Welsh schemes also provide free travel in the morning peak.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000044"></a>I hope the Minister will rethink on this matter. It  is a big issue which I am sure will be discussed  during the passage of the legislation. I beg to  move.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000045"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07010813000283"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> It gives me pleasure to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I have not so far received notice of the grouping of amendments in an accessible form. I intend no criticism but I wish the Committee to be aware of this in case I trip up over the grouping of amendments. We are working with the authorities of the House to find ways of ensuring that I get papers of this kind in time before debates. I am sure that any problems that remain will be resolved shortly but I wish the Committee to be aware of that circumstance before we go any further.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000046"></a>I do not wish to speak at great length because the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has covered many of the points I want to make. I wish to stress that bus travel should not be seen as separate from the rest of the transport network but as part of an integrated system which is always going to be as weak as its weakest link. Thus, if part of a journey involves a mode of transport on which no concession is available, the purpose in granting the concession substantially fails or, at least, is substantially undermined. This group of amendments, particularly Amendments Nos. 3, 28 and 30 in relation to London, therefore provides that concessions should be available on trains, Underground trains, trams and ferries, all of which can play a part in meeting the transport needs of an area.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000047"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, in Scotland many ferry journeys are covered by the concessionary fares scheme in recognition of the local transport services that ferries provide between the Scottish islands and the mainland. We would want to encourage the same approach for similar services throughout the UK.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000048"></a>Similarly, as regards London, Amendments Nos. 3, 28 and 30 seek to substitute &#147;London Transport Network&#148; for &#147;London bus network&#148; to cover all modes of transport which exist to meet the transport needs of Londoners. We all know that the Tube is just as important as the buses in meeting the transport needs of the capital, and rail and light railway services also play an important part.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000049"></a>On Amendment No. 4 and corresponding amendments in relation to London, at Second Reading the Minister stressed the role of the Bill in combating social exclusion. He said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010813000244"></a>&#147;The Government recognise that buses are particularly important for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. They often provide a vital lifeline to services such as shops, leisure facilities and hospitals and are an important connection to the community&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010813000240"></a>He went on,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010813000245"></a>&#147;We recognise that the places to which people need to travel are no respecters of sometimes arbitrary local authority boundaries&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/12/06; col. 1453.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07010813000241"></a>I suggest that they are also no respecters of arbitrary time zones.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000050"></a>If social inclusion of those who are most disadvantaged in our community is the goal, we have to enable them to travel at the same times as others want to travel to work, to shop or to the hospital. Hospitals do not have regard to concessionary travel schemes when making appointments. The restriction of concessionary travel during the morning peak period has a number of untoward consequences. As the Government have improved the minimum concessionary fare scheme for older and disabled people, some local authorities have curtailed schemes that previously offered more than the statutory minimum; for example, some schemes which provided free morning peak travel for blind people and other old and disabled people have come under pressure. As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, when the matter arose in London, following representations by disabled people the scheme was levelled up and free travel was extended to all disabled people in the morning peak as well as at other times.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000051"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister laid great stress on the fact that there are acute pinch points in transport usage at peak hours in many parts of the country. I can say only that there have been no time restrictions on using the Freedom Pass during the morning peak in London since April 2003. That has not caused difficulties, despite the huge pressure on public transport at that time in the capital. We would probably all find it difficult to envisage any part of the country with more acute pinch points than London, yet this does not seem to have presented any particular problem.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has covered most of the points I wanted to make, but in conclusion I want to underline a point which he stressed; namely, the importance of concessionary travel schemes in helping disabled people to get to work. If they are to be effective, they need to be available at peak times no less than at off-peak times. The importance of that in the Bill is the way in which it underlines the Government&#146;s  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>welfare-to-work agenda. It could be of material assistance in helping disabled people off welfare and into work if concessionary travel were available to them at peak times no less than at off-peak times. I support this group of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000053"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010813000284"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the two noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate on important amendments. I recognise the case that has been put. The Committee has great sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Low, on how we provide for him adequate documentation when the documentation becomes available only late in the day, shortly before the Committee meets. We will do all in our power to ensure that the problem is overcome. As he addressed himself to this group of amendments with accuracy, he does not have to worry unduly today.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, emphasised that local authorities might find a reduction in their enhancements in certain of their schemes. That happens from time to time, but he will recognise that local authorities have a discretion to offer travel concessions on other forms of public transport and at other times. Indeed, some of them offer enhancements to the statutory minimum scheme and we would want to do nothing that does not encourage that. The Bill preserves the flexibility of local authorities to offer concessions on other forms of public transport or at other, and earlier, times on a discretionary basis if they choose to do so. The Bill is about statutory provision and the reason we have no plans to extend the statutory concessions to other forms of public transport or to travel at other times is straightforward.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000055"></a>First, this is about legislation. Nothing in the Bill inhibits the Government in being able to do that in future: we have powers in the Bill for extending these opportunities when resources become available. But Members of the Committee will recognise that extension involves substantial sums of money. They will be aware of the substantial commitment of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to funding the principles behind the Bill in order to implement it in 2008. If we accepted Amendments Nos. 3, 28 and 30 to include travel on trains, the Underground, trams and ferries, it would cost an extra &#163;300 million a year. He says that it is done in Scotland and they may do so in Wales. They have to meet the bill and from what one learns it is not decreasing: it is increasing substantially. That is a choice that they must make and it is the principle of devolution. We are talking about extending the provisions right across England, which will have a larger impact and will be more expensive. I emphasise that in our estimate Amendments Nos. 3, 28 and 30 alone will cost an extra &#163;300 million a year and that Amendments Nos. 4 and 29 will cost an extra &#163;100 million a year. That is almost double the amount made available by the Chancellor for the principle of the scheme.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000056"></a>I am not saying that these things are not desirable; I say merely that we cannot readily accept such extensions, with their significant resource implications, without due consideration. We have to work hard in order to create the resources available for the implementation of the scheme in 2008 implicit in the Bill. For us to be subjected to amendments which more than double the cost would be regarded as somewhat unreasonable.</p>




<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000057"></a>I want to emphasise that the Bill does not inhibit these developments in due course as resources allow. However, I am resisting adding amendments to the Bill which would place immediate additional costs on the Government. We have to be realistic about these matters. Of course I understand the case that can be made for any enhancement of opportunities for people to travel. The noble Lord, Lord Low, mentioned the point I made at Second Reading that we regard it as crucial that social inclusion must involve transport and the opportunities of transport for the disabled. But he will recognise, as will the Committee, that this Government have been very concerned to develop this policy over the years. They introduced the first statutory concession for older and disabled people in 2000. In 2002, eligibility for both men and women was equalised at 60 years of age. In April 2006, the statutory scheme was again improved to offer free local concessionary travel; and under this Bill, from 2008 the statutory scheme will be improved further.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000058"></a>All I am saying is that we could not by additional amendments to this Bill readily accept that we could make such a significant leap forward in the allocation of resources in this area, however desirable they are. I want to assure the Committee that&#151;in so far as what is at stake here is the nature of the Bill and the powers it gives in order to ensure the development of this policy&#151;the Bill contains the necessary powers for additional enhancement and improvement of the scheme as years go by. What I am not prepared to accept in this year of grace, having seen the successful allocation of a substantial sum of money for the implementation of the scheme implicit in the Bill, is additions which more than double those costs in circumstances where I cannot guarantee that resources are available.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000059"></a>Therefore, I hope the noble Lord will recognise that we are at one with him in desiring these objectives; that this legislation creates a framework in which those objectives can be realised in due course; but that his amendments are hugely costly&#151;and I do not think they would be likely to find entire favour with his side if in fact his Treasury team were in government rather than where it is at present.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000060"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010813000285"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply. I totally accept that the overall cost is very extensive. There are parts to this&#151;for example, extending the scheme to the use of buses at peak times and using the Tube rather than buses. There is no doubt that for some journeys the Tube or a short train journey might be more suitable for disabled people than buses. They would not be using the provision twice; it would be an alternative use. I can think of various places where a short train journey from one town to another might be better or more accessible than a bus journey, which does not actually cover those two small towns. So sometimes it would be an alternative use. Certainly the use of the provision at peak times in the morning is my main plank, as I said in my introduction of this, that I would like the Government to consider.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000061"></a>I know that my own party would consider some of these things because they might be a priority. Before we next discuss them, perhaps the Minister could give

I wonder if, for example, he could estimate how much it would cost to extend the provision. Obviously it is extended in London to peak times, and London is an enormous conurbation with a lot of use at peak times. That does not seem to have bankrupted London. Therefore, that is one part I would particularly like to look at more than others. Perhaps they could give me a break down of how that &#163;300 million comes about, so that I might consider before further stages what areas we might look at in more detail.</p>

I, too, am grateful to the Minister for his reply. He displayed a great deal of sympathy with the thrust of the amendment&#151;its principle&#151;and his reluctance to accept it was principally on the ground of available resources. Of course one completely understands that, but if the desirability of the amendment is recognised, perhaps the best way forward would be to try to break down the additional costs of additional modes of transport for different categories of user, so that if the whole sum cannot be afforded, smaller parts could be.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000063"></a>The arguments that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and I advanced apply to both disabled and elderly people, but for disabled people, there are particular reasons for disregarding the distinction between peak and off-peak travel times. First, it is often necessary even for short journeys for disabled people to use public transport rather than walk either because of restricted mobility or because they cannot find the way. Also, for persons with restricted mobility, the pedestrian environment is often either inaccessible or unsafe. For all those reasons, free bus travel at peak times can be especially important to enable disabled people to integrate into the community. It would be very helpful if the Minister could consider how much of the total sum to which he referred is made up of expenditure on disabled people.</p>

I must say that I do not think that we can meet the objective of the noble Lord, Lord Low, of costings for particular categories of the disabled. We will look at how we can help. I am eager to be helpful because the noble Lord will recognise that we appreciate his point, but it may be difficult for us to achieve and I do not hold out too much hope to him in that respect.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000065"></a>In broader terms, I think that I can do a bit more for the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. If it is not enough, we will do more work for him before we reach Report. Our initial analysis is that the estimated annual cost of extending the statutory minimum to trams would be in the order of &#163;15 million, to local rail&#151;trains&#151;about &#163;250 million, and to community transport, at least &#163;25 million. I think that the Committee will recognise that we have all sorts of difficulties with the definition of community transport and therefore the implicit cost. That is as far as I can go in being helpful at this stage.</p>

The specific means that we are looking at are getting people to work, to hospital appointments and around. Perhaps we could do a bit more analysis before the next round. I accept that providing concessionary free train travel for everyone would cost multimillions of pounds. That is where his big amount of &#163;250 million came from.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000071"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendments Nos. 10 and 16 would put in the Bill the definitions for the eligibility of concessionary fares that are in the Transport Act 2000, and would add to them an additional section covering those with mental health difficulties. The additional Amendment No. 16 would make it mandatory for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on those definitions. A number of organisations that represent those with some form of disability are concerned that Clause 1(4) requires the issuing of concessionary fares to those who &#147;appear&#148; to be disabled. We believe that  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is not clear enough, and that a definition should be included in the Bill along the lines of that in the Transport Act 2000.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000072"></a>Furthermore, Clause 1(6) says that the Secretary of State &#147;may issue guidance&#148; to which local authorities &#147;must have regard&#148;. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 introduces similar provisions for Wales. We have this debate on a great number of Bills; we toy with the &#147;mays&#148; and the &#147;musts&#148; on most occasions. We want the word &#147;may&#148; in Clause 1(6) to be changed to &#147;shall&#148;, to ensure that similar guidance is issued to the very clear guidance issued following the introduction of the minimum concessionary fare for disabled people under the Transport Act 2000.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000073"></a>Paragraphs (f) and (g), which would be added by the amendment, relate to people with mental health issues. It is clear that eligibility for concessionary fares is one of the major factors in determining an individual&#146;s chance of recovery and reintegration into society. Access to community centre, drop-in therapeutic communities, counselling or self-help groups and medical appointments can be essential to their recovery. Many service users rely on public transport. Even when they still hold a driving licence, poverty and a fluctuating health condition may make driving impossible.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000074"></a>Most of those with mental health issues who currently qualify for concessionary fares do so by virtue of the fact that they would, if they applied, be refused a driving licence under Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Section 92 of the 1988 Act refers to five categories of people who would be refused a driving licence. The second of these are people with a severe mental disorder. It is under that category that people with mental health problems may become entitled to concessionary fares. The definition is medical, not social, and our view is that it is not appropriate in the field of disability, and is one key reason why those with mental health problems have difficulty in obtaining concessionary fares.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000075"></a>Should the issue of definition prove intractable, we would welcome an assurance by the Government that they will consult with mental health service users in voluntary bodies working in mental health, and organisations of mental health professionals, with a view to establishing a less exclusive medical definition of serious mental health problems, and one that would target real need without being too broad, to enable these people to access the concessionary fare system. I beg to move.</p>

I was grateful at Second Reading for the Minister&#146;s reassurance that the definition of &#147;disabled&#148; in the Bill will not change. He said that in this legislation the Government will use the same definition as the one which governs entitlement. That is very welcome as far as it goes but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has explained, there is a need for the definition to change a little to incorporate those with mental health difficulties. The Minister may feel that such people are adequately covered already, in the way indicated by the noble Baroness, under the Road Traffic Act, but it would be clearer if the definition were consolidated. One could then see on the face of

On that basis, I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000077"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07010813000293"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords who have spoken. I agree about the importance of access to transport in reducing social exclusion and the Government are committed strongly to these objectives. That is why we are spending &#163;1 billion a year on statutory concessionary travel to improve the mobility and well-being of older and disabled people. The Committee will recognise that we have already delivered significant improvements in this respect, but we are not in a position to commit further funding to concessionary travel beyond that which is established as the basis of the Bill. In any case, until the extension of the national bus concession has been evaluated, both in its effectiveness for the categories we are discussing and the efficiency of the scheme, we do not think we should at this stage take the scheme further. We can only intelligently do that once the impact of the national scheme has been fully considered and evaluated.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000078"></a>The Transport Act 2000 sets out the groups of people to whom travel concessions must be provided by law. In addition, under the Transport Act 1985, local authorities have the discretion to offer travel concessions to other groups. As I emphasised earlier in our discussions, the Bill preserves the flexibility of local authorities to offer concessions to any group or individual, at their discretion, based on the assessment of the benefits of doing so. There is also a corresponding power to include new categories of people to benefit from the new national scheme. We believe the ability to extend the concession on the basis of local and national need is the most appropriate way to proceed, not by an amendment to the Bill as proposed in Amendment No. 10.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000079"></a>I am also obliged to ask the noble Baroness to withdraw Amendment No. 16 which would require the Secretary of State to issue guidance to local authorities as to the definition of whether a person is a disabled person. Given that the Government are not presently in a position to extend the eligibility for the national concession, it is not necessary to require the Secretary of State to issue such guidance. He would of course continue to issue guidance as required. Guidance exists at the present time and we retain that capacity. Such an extension would increase the scope of the scheme in ways which, for obvious reasons, as I have indicated, we are not prepared to contemplate at the present time.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000080"></a>Of course, as resources become available, we recognise that we must have in place legislation which enables us to enhance what already exists. The Bill preserves that in its entirety. It creates a scope for the Secretary of State to act if necessary, and preserves the right of local authorities to enhance and extend definitions of beneficiaries as they see fit. On that basis, I believe the Bill meets the broad objectives of the amendments. The Government are not in a position at this stage to accept the specific requirements of the amendments.</p>

Interestingly, he has been very adaptable on the last two amendments but we do not seem to be getting quite the same response on this matter. That is unfortunate because mental health disability, as everyone now recognises, is of significant importance in people&#146;s lives. We should probably encompass mental health whenever we talk about disability. My amendment would extend the definition of disability in the Transport Act 2000. It would probably not be a very expensive concession either, given the number of people who might be involved in it, but I have not costed it.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000082"></a>I am also slightly surprised that the Minister does not accept that it would be helpful to reproduce in the Bill the definitions in the Transport Act 2000. That is what my first amendment was about, although it was extended to include mental health. It is quite important that people understand and know the intention behind legislation. Far too often, we put forward legislation that is a bit wobbly and does not really help people when they see it. As the noble Lord, Lord Low, said, you have to go fumbling around other legislation to find out what is intended. We will consider whether we want to press the matter further but the amendment does have merit.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000083"></a>I am not in a position to withdraw Amendment No. 16 at the moment. The wording of subsection (6) is interesting. It seeks to change,</p>
<ul><a name="07010813000263"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may issue guidance to travel concession authorities&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07010813000242"></a>to &#147;the Secretary of State shall issue guidance to travel concession authorities&#148;. If when determining whether a person is a disabled person for the purposes of subsection (4) you have to have regard to any guidance that may be issued, it is sensible that the Secretary of State should have to issue guidance to which you have to have regard. It is a question of the conditional against the positive and it would be of benefit if the Secretary of State were to issue that guidance to which people must have regard, otherwise we might have to turn the conditionals around within the terms of the sentence.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000089"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 11 and the other amendments in the group are probing. I acknowledge immediately that they would have the financial implications that we have been talking about and I am sure the Minister will be able to enlighten us on how much they would be. However, I shall put on record the principle behind the amendments. They would allow for the provision of door-to-door transport for those unable to access mainstream public transport and would also allow a companion to accompany them who, under this scheme, would be exempt from cost.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000090"></a>Even where more accessible vehicles have been introduced on public transport routes, they will never be a viable option for some disabled people, even with assistance. Concessionary fares should therefore also be available on community transport and door-to-door services.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000091"></a>Other disabled people may need door-to-door transport because of the inaccessibility of the pedestrian environment already referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Low, or because it is a rural area and too far to go on foot. For example, there may be a lack of dropped kerbs or barriers on the footway&#151;all the things that impact on making it difficult for people with disabilities to walk.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000092"></a>The amendments would also allow for a companion to travel free with a disabled person, both inside and outside London, where it is necessary for the disabled person to be able to make the journey because of their impairment. Not all disabled people are able to access mainstream public transport on their own and it is not only people with physical or sentient disabilities who are so affected. There are also particular issues for people with phobias or who experience high levels of anxiety or disorientation in busy or unfamiliar places. Those people may also need someone with them for support.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000093"></a>Concessions should be available to allow a companion to travel free of charge where it is necessary to access mainstream public transport. That is already provided for under both the Welsh scheme, on which the amendment is based, and the scheme in Dorset. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>free cross-border transport in England in 2008 and, in due course, across the UK, but remain concerned that people living in areas without bus services or those unable to use buses will continue to be disadvantaged.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000095"></a>The Minister laid considerable stress at Second Reading on the role of concessionary travel in promoting social inclusion. It seems inequitable that the concession continues to exclude older people who are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion because they are dependent on forms of transport other than the bus, whether because they cannot use public transport for mobility reasons or because they live in a rural area with no access to a car. It is currently estimated that 27 per cent of people over 65 living in rural areas have no access to a car. We also know that rural areas are those where a proportion of the older population is growing the fastest.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000096"></a>In a recent survey which asked what alternative transport arrangements people would have to make to access similar services if their local post office closed, Age Concern found that only 46 per cent of respondents said that they would use the bus; 36 per cent said that they would use their car or that of a relative or friend; but 33 per cent said that they would need to use a taxi, with smaller numbers ticking the box labelled dial-a-ride or community transport schemes. Obviously, if we add up those percentages, we see that some people were ticking more than one box.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000097"></a>There is thus a powerful case for extending the scheme to modes of transport other than the bus. The Bill continues to provide powers for local authorities to offer more generous provisions than the statutory minimum but we know from past experience that local discretion simply results in a postcode lottery. Funding pressure on local authorities to meet the requirements of improved statutory concessions has also resulted in the withdrawal of more generous schemes.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000098"></a>Thus there is a case for extending the Bill to provide access to transport for all people over 60. Age Concern has estimated that a concession for community transport would cost in the region of &#163;25 million, and that has been confirmed by the figures referred to earlier by the Minister when we were discussing Amendment No. 3. At the moment we do not know how to estimate the cost of those who are able to access buses but whose problem is the frequency or availability of the service.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000099"></a>Age Concern would like to see a provision in the Bill for people to have the choice of applying either for a bus concession or for tokens to an annual maximum that would enable them to access alternative forms of transport, such as taxis or, more probably, community transport schemes. Some local authorities, such as Portsmouth, already offer such a scheme. If such provision is not seen as possible at this stage, perhaps the Government could produce a report within the next year or so on a concessionary solution for people who do not have bus services in their area or who, for various reasons, are unable to use buses.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000101"></a>It may seem odd that I, who live and work in Wales, would take part in a Bill that affected England but I was asked by Help the Aged to table the amendment in my name. I agreed to do so because of the patient population that I know of only too well who cannot access bus travel. We should not underestimate such people, particularly those who are older, who have bone disease, whose balance is perhaps not always what it could be and who cannot travel on buses. Some of these patients have tried to do so but have fallen and sustained fractures. I know of such cases personally.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000102"></a>As my noble friend Lord Low has said, in areas where there are flexible concessions, they are well taken up, are extremely popular and are certainly not abused. In many areas there are flexible concessions but the individual also has to top them up in order to travel a further distance. Those are also very popular because they allow people to get out of the isolation of lonely living, where they see nothing but the four walls in which they live&#151;day in, day out. It is incredibly important for the health and welfare of our population that they remain as mobile as possible. In some parts of the country there are no reasonable bus services for such people to access.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000103"></a>The principle of the amendment in my name is not to make the Government do anything at this stage but simply to give the Secretary of State powers that he can use in future, if he so wishes. I hope that the Minister will not turn his back on putting such increased powers on the face of the Bill. They would allow the Secretary of State to put pressure on local authorities to look at flexible concessions and to introduce imaginative schemes in their locality. For those that do not, the Secretary of State would ultimately be able to wield a stick, rather than simply a carrot, in trying to persuade them.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000104"></a>It is vital that in a Bill as important as this for maintaining mobility in the population we do not ignore the very people whose mobility and mental health are under greatest threat by allowing them to remain isolated because they are too old or too disabled to fall within the provisions of the Bill and able to use it in a practical way.</p>

I want to emphasise to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that if I have been less constructive in my response to her amendments, there is nothing personal intended&#151;it is the nature of the amendments that dictate the quality of our exchanges.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000106"></a>I am not sure that I will be much more helpful with regard to this group than I was with regard to the last. I emphasise to the noble Baroness that local authorities have the discretion to offer travel concessions on other forms of public transport, such as dial-a-ride services  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and taxis, and for accompanying companions for disabled persons. A national scheme, however, raises profound issues of cost. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendments do not constrain the extent of these provisions. It is one thing to talk of concessions on buses, which we can define in terms of the services being provided, it is another to talk of offering the same support to taxi services. It is not indicated here that there would necessarily be any mileage constraint on that, nor is it clear who the accompanying person might be, by any definition.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000107"></a>Not that the noble Baroness&#146;s intention is anything but entirely proper and to be supported in terms of objectives of enhancing opportunities for these categories of people, but one can see the open-ended nature of these amendments and the implications for costs. She has sufficient local government experience to recognise&#151;but I am sure a word with her local friend, who also plays such a prominent part in local government, would confirm&#151;that it is unlikely that local government would accept such an open-ended commitment without some idea of the potential costs and how it would guarantee that they were adequately reimbursed.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000108"></a>Local authorities that exercise their role in this area are doing so responsibly and with care. The trouble with these amendments, if they were to be introduced into the Bill in national terms, is that local authorities would lose the discretion and would be obliged to meet the requirement. The Committee will recognise just how extensive those commitments might be. I assure the Committee, however, as I have done on the previous amendments, that the Bill preserves the flexibility for local authorities to offer concessions on other forms of public transport and to offer alternative travel token schemes, if they wish to do so, under the discretionary schemes set up under the Transport Act 1985. There is also a power, under the Transport Act 2000, for the Secretary of State to extend a national concession to other modes of public passenger transport, including accessible community transport services.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000109"></a>We have the legislative powers, therefore, to make progress in these areas. I am obviously hesitant&#151;rather more than hesitant; reluctant&#151;about accepting amendments that appear to impose upon local authorities not areas of discretion, but obligations, some of which look very open-ended indeed. We are not in a position to accept amendments that extend the principles of the scheme that far.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000110"></a>I also recognise the strength of the representations made again by the noble Lord, Lord Low, on the question of the problems of disabled people with regard to the infrequency or inadequacy of local buses, particularly in rural areas. I emphasise to the Committee that there are many users of rural buses and we are concerned to improve the quality of those services. We are providing over &#163;50 million a year to local authorities to help them support rural bus services. The grant has risen from &#163;32 million a year when it was introduced in 1998 and will provide more than &#163;55 million in 2007-08. So we are committed to increasing support for rural buses. I recognise the valid point of the noble Lord, Lord Low, about the availability and accessibility of these services, but I

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000111"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, spoke to her amendment and emphasised the progress that has been made in Wales. I am well aware of her extensive experience of that. Even before she bobbed out from the Committee, the noble Baroness might have already detected that I was a little reluctant to accept examples from Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in relation to the Bill. This is not because I am discriminating against the Welsh, being Welsh myself, the Scots or the Northern Irish, but simply because their circumstances, the provisions they make, the extent and costs of their schemes, are very different from the provision in England. It is entirely for the Welsh Assembly to make its decisions in these matters&#151;I would be the last to intrude upon such deliberations&#151;but that does not mean that its experience is automatically translatable into the English experience.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000112"></a>I do not see why we should oblige local authorities to offer any particular concession. If we oblige them to do so, by definition we take away the discretionary nature of the schemes they employ. They have the power to make concessions if they wish to do so. Some English local authorities are very large indeed. They have populations which, although not as great as the whole of Wales, are certainly as great as a substantial part of it, and it is only right that they should have elements of discretion too.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000113"></a>As I indicated earlier, we have no plans to extend the statutory concession to other forms of transport or to accompanying companions. Any such extensions are possible in the future. I have no doubt that noble Lords on the Committee and elsewhere and others of like mind&#151;there are many in government who will join with them on this&#151;will look in the future towards the enhancement of the present schemes. Any extensions can be effected under this legislation; we have the provisions in place. It will therefore be recognised that while the amendments may look valuable in extending the scheme, they would not actually increase the powers to achieve their objectives in the future. They would present a hefty bill immediately the legislation became law rather than when a more mature reflection had been made and resources were available.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000114"></a>The noble Baroness will recognise that I am not against the principle she is putting forward&#151;far from it. I am saying that we have the legislative framework within which such a principle could be implemented in due course. To avoid unintended consequences, any decision to extend the national statutory entitlement would have to be fully funded and the impact fully considered. The problems with regard to certain forms of transport and companions will need definition lest the opportunity for abuse completely overwhelms the scheme and the confidence of those who implement it is lost.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000115"></a>This is true also in regard to Amendments Nos. 11 and 31. There is no limit on when services can be used, on whether or not the travel must be local, on the use of taxis and on the other services to be provided for free. Travel is a valuable and important resource and we recognise that categories of our fellow citizens

The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, put the case very forcefully indeed for people whose health might otherwise suffer because they are confined within a limited framework; but, in tackling that problem&#151;I agree it is an issue which has to be assessed and tackled&#151;we cannot create in legislation a framework that offers the potential for such widespread availability and access as to render the situation quite unmanageable from the Government&#146;s point of view.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000116"></a>With our proposed new national concession, the Government&#146;s spending on concessionary travel will be approximately &#163;1 billion a year. We are committed to accessible public transport for disabled people. Regulations requiring buses and other forms of public transport to be accessible have been introduced, but we must be realistic. It would not serve the interests of the disabled or the wider interests of the country to accept amendments that would open the door to such a wide entitlement to travel that would be ill defined and hugely costly.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000117"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010813000301"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply. I am not indulging in a burst of paranoia; I have seen the Minister often enough to know that he will not accept all my amendments. I am, however, simply feeling a bit tweaked in the early new year that I am not getting anywhere. I can see that I will get nowhere again. I shall say only two things. I did say that the outset that this was a probing amendment and I acknowledged that there were financial implications to it. It was tabled to hear the Minister&#146;s reply to a very important point.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000118"></a>The Minister has said that this can be done in future. I presume that these schemes can be extended only by order of the Secretary of State. They would therefore have to be extended by secondary legislation and across the board. Now that this is a national scheme, it would have to be accepted that people wanted it to be applied nationally, rather than by each local authority. The Minister may know the answer. If he does not, I would be grateful if he could ensure that I received an answer before we reach the next stage. This is what we are really looking for.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000119"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, put it when speaking to her amendment, this is about the acceptance of the principle that people who are not in a position to manage public transport are therefore in effect being denied access to a reasonable life and a reasonable existence. They might be able to have that access with a companion to help them. That is what I was alluding to when I talked about a companion travelling for free as a concession on public transport.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000120"></a>I heard what the Minister said in reply. We need to look a little further at the permissiveness of other legislation, but the extent of the permissiveness of the current legislation without secondary legislation is also important. I expect that is what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000121"></a>For today, I will withdraw the amendment. Perhaps we will return to this when we have looked at the matter in more detail, but I put on record the fact that I accept that there could be financial implications, so that people understand that I am not simply off on a flight of fancy. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000128"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 19 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 40, all of which are tabled in my name and those of my noble friends. These amendments each concern in a different way the issue of how the scheme will be funded, and it is this aspect of the Bill which is giving local authorities most concern. We therefore see this as an opportunity to explore some of the issues they have raised.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000129"></a>There are two broad aspects to the question of funding, the first of which asks whether enough money will be available; that is, is the quantum sum to be made available for the scheme large enough? This is vital because there is evidence to show that when you alter the concessionary fares scheme, as happened last year in England and before that in Wales and Scotland, demand increases. In fact it would be ridiculous if demand did not increase. One of the reasons for providing this sort of scheme is in order to facilitate bus travel by pensioners and the disabled. Clearly there will be higher costs and one can only estimate how they are going to work out. We know that more people are now taking up passes than was the case previously and that those who hold passes make more journeys. Further, bus fares are rising above the level of the retail prices index, partly because of industry costs which are rising above the inflation rate. However, we must also recognise that in bringing in a group of people who will not be paying their bus fares, it will alter the way in which bus operators look at fare increases. No longer will they feel so worried about increasing fares because they will not have to deal with irate passengers. That has an inflationary effect. Given this, can the Minister explain how the Government will keep under review the actual costs being met by local government generally, which relates closely to what is happening in the bus industry?</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000130"></a>Secondly, and probably more important, is the impact of the scheme in specific locations and on specific local authorities. The proposed system for reimbursement is to be via local authority block grant to district and unitary councils. There are two problems with this. First, district and unitary authorities are not usually the transport authorities. In metropolitan councils passenger transport authorities provide bus services, while in two-tier areas they are provided by county councils. There is therefore no requirement for district councils to pass on the sums they receive to the authority providing the service.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000131"></a>Secondly, I think it is accepted that the block grant is a fairly crude instrument based on variable inputs such as population and demographics. What it does  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC23"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not measure is the main output; that is, the number of bus journeys made. For the reasons I have given, it is likely that they will increase. The danger is that in areas where high and improving quality bus services are well promoted and provided, demand will increase still further and in a sense those authorities are going to be financially penalised for increasing demand for bus journeys. We know that this happened in the past when the scheme was introduced on a local authority basis. I gave some examples at Second Reading such as in Tyne and Wear, and in Bath and North East Somerset, which is currently facing a shortfall of around &#163;680,000&#151;a lot of money for a relatively small local authority. Devon County Council faced a shortfall of around &#163;2 million. We have to recognise that the impact of the scheme in certain areas will be greater and cannot be dealt with in the average way. So while we welcome the fact that the scheme is to be extended into a national one, something we have called for, there will be difficulties in some areas which can only be described as honey pots, those in which extra journeys will be created. I know that authorities such as Blackpool are rather worried about this issue.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70108-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000132"></a>Local authorities have only two ways in which they can deal with a shortfall in their funding. Either they can raise council tax&#151;which is clearly not entirely desirable, and of course they face capping to prevent them from raising it too much&#151;or they can make cuts in services. What usually happens is that a local authority will not cut other areas of service provision in order to pay for concessionary bus fares. They are more likely to make cuts in spending on public transport. That means cutting highly subsidised services in rural areas, Sunday services or evening provision. Ironically, concessionary fares are provided for a higher number of people but they will have fewer bus services on which to use them, while of course those without concessions are heavily penalised because there are fewer services available.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000133"></a>Broadly these are the financial concerns which local authorities are raising, and one way or another they are all covered in the amendments in this group. While technically the amendments may not be perfect, I am sure the noble Lord understands that they are a mechanism to use in Grand Committee to air these concerns. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000134"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07010813000303"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I rise to support these amendments and to speak to Amendment No. 22 in the group, which is similar in intent. Indeed, many of the arguments I shall put forward have already been made by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, and therefore I shall keep my remarks to the minimum.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000135"></a>It would not be incorrect to say that this entire scheme is dependent for its success on effective co-operation and administration by local authorities. I fully support that objective and it is a welcome move on the part of a Government who for too long have been unable or unwilling to trust local government to do this. I shall speak on that issue in more detail later. I feel strongly that this scheme should be administered by local authorities and it is therefore vital that we all  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recognise the important role they have to play in delivering it. However, there must be national funding to ensure its success.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000136"></a>The mechanism for the actual delivery of the scheme has not been determined. As the noble Baroness has just made clear, if it is to be made through the block grant, that might not be as satisfactory as it should be. Whatever arrangement is settled on, the key principle must be that local councils are fully funded and suffer no financial risk. We have talked about the concessionary and other elements that local authorities might take on, which is up to them. As everyone is aware, local government is under severe cost pressures in the form of adult social care provision, waste and so forth. Local authorities want to support this scheme and the Government have said they want them to do that, and therefore we must find the funding nationally to support the provisions that come out of this legislation.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000137"></a>I am not normally in favour of specific grants. Generally I prefer local authorities to be able to decide on their spending, but this might be an exception. I think the Government recognise that there may also be capital costs in setting up the scheme initially. Given that, will the Minister explain how he sees this being provided for? That is why we have tabled subsection (2) of the proposed new clause. Effectively it would allow local authorities to claim back any expenses they incur in setting up the scheme during its first year of operation. I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response explaining the work being done in this area. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000138"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07010813000304"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> I intervene to offer an explanation of why I have not supported the amendments concerning disabled people moved by noble Lords. We are very unhappy about the funding of the scheme as it is and we want that put right before we talk about extensions to it. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I am very uneasy about whether there is enough money, or whether such money as there is is properly targeted to those who need it. That is why I emphasise the need to move as quickly as possible to a better scheme based on smartcards, which would enable us to direct the funding to where it is needed and to pay it directly.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000139"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and my noble friend Lady Scott, I am extremely anxious to hear what the Minister has to say about investigation of a scheme which is showing huge promise in its first few months in terms of the number of people using it. In my locality, an increase in bus use of 43 per cent has been far more dramatic than that of any other initiative taken by the Government. The cost implications of such a scheme merit further careful consideration.</p>

I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, for his contribution. When I was struggling with the issue of how far we should extend the scheme, I automatically assumed that his preserved silence was one of assent for the government position,  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because I always assume silence on the part of opposition parties as assent to what the Government are doing. I know that we have got it just about right if they are quiet. I am now grateful that he has reinforced that impression. We must tread with care on the question of how extensive the scheme is to be, because it must be properly funded. That is why I resisted earlier amendments; I was anxious to guarantee that we are working within the means available.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000141"></a>We are confident in broad terms that the &#163;1 billion that we will be spending in total on concessionary fares will be sufficient to meet all demands in the system. The extra &#163;250 million related to the Bill includes provision for increased pass take-up&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made the point that there are early indications of the enthusiasm with which people who are qualified will take advantage of the new opportunities&#151;and assumptions about costs and fares. I heard what the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, had to say about the increased cost of bus fares, but we think that we have taken those adequately into account.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000142"></a>I respect her point that the impact of free or concessionary travel may be disproportionate for some authorities, which will take much more of the strain than others because of the nature of what they provide and the advantages that concessionary travellers will see of going to those &#147;honey pots&#148;&#151;I think that that was her term. I have heard Blackpool described in many terms&#151;generally favourable but sometimes unfavourable&#151;but never have I heard it called a honey pot before. On behalf of the good folk of Blackpool, I shall take that as a compliment. We are working very hard to ensure proper collaboration between local government and the Treasury so that when we allocate the &#163;250 million, it takes into account the disproportionate effects. There is no doubt that a national scheme has disproportionate effects on local authorities.</p>
<h5><a name="07010813000270"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000143"></a>I should like to put the issue of local authority funding to bed. Amendments Nos. 20 to 22 seek to ensure that local authorities are adequately funded by central government to provide reimbursement for the national concession. I am aware that issue of local authority funding goes far wider than the scope of the Bill. I bore in mind the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that he was beginning to think in terms of hypothecation on this issue in relation to local authorities. We are aware that powerful voices will still argue against that for all sorts of reasons, but local authorities will certainly want to be assured that they will be adequately refunded for the costs of operating the scheme, which was the burden of the noble Lord&#146;s remarks. Concessionary fares reimbursement is only one of many obligations that authorities must face, and we know their skill in managing matters in this area.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000144"></a>We have made provision for the principles of the Bill to be adequately funded. There is the issue of how the funding should be distributed, but that will involve extensive discussion and collaboration with local authorities and I cannot come forward with a blueprint at this stage. No noble Lord in the Committee would  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expect me to do that. However, the Committee does expect reassurance over the proportions and difficult funding allocations and that funding should follow the needs. We fully take that argument on board and recognise its importance. Speaking on behalf of the Government, it is in our interests to ensure that local authorities are adequately funded for providing these statutory concessions.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000145"></a>Amendment No. 40 drifts into the general issue of how passenger transport authorities are funded by their metropolitan districts. I see no reason why concessionary fares should be different from other aspects of transport policy that a PTA, through its executive, delivers on behalf of the districts of which it consists. The proposed change interferes with a well established and adequate system for funding the PTAs. It is also worth pointing out that under our proposals in the Bill, no PTA would be obliged to agree a joint scheme with a metropolitan district council. If the PTA felt that funding was not forthcoming, it might reasonably refuse to agree to the joint scheme. I can therefore see no reason for changing that mechanism, which has worked in the past. I recognise the challenges posed by the Bill, but they should not create difficulties in this area.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000146"></a>On the issue of operator reimbursement, at the moment local authorities are required to reimburse bus operators only for concessionary journeys made wholly within their area. From April 2008, elderly and disabled people resident in England will be able to travel for free on off-peak local bus services anywhere in England. Therefore, the basis on which operators are reimbursed also needs to change. Amendment No. 19 is not the right way in which to go about that, and the concern that may have prompted it has already been addressed in the Bill. Section 149 of the Transport Act 2000, as it would be amended by the Bill, will require travel concession authorities to reimburse operators for providing the national concession on journeys beginning in their area. The national concession must, under Section 145, be provided to those holding passes issued by any travel concession authority in England, as well as those issued under the London schemes. Hence, travel concession authorities will already be obliged to reimburse operators for trips begun in their area and made by concessionaires resident outside their area.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000147"></a>This approach renders the authority in which the eligible person resides totally irrelevant. This must be right under a national scheme. It also negates the need for unworkable billing arrangements whereby 300 local authorities could be billing each other for trips made by each other&#146;s eligible residents. The whole Committee would react in horror to any such concept. We reacted in horror in advance of the concept being adumbrated in the Committee, which is why we are putting forward these proposals.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000148"></a>Amendment No. 20 also calls for a standard scheme for reimbursing the bus operators for all the costs incurred in carrying concessionaires. Current legislation already requires that operators should be no better or worse off as a result of carrying concessionaires. As such, operators are entitled to be fully reimbursed for any additional costs incurred. There are acknowledged

A more standard approach to reimbursement can also be achieved through existing regulation-making powers, which the Bill preserves. I can give the Committee that reassurance.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000149"></a>We are working with operators and local authorities to put in place revised and more efficient arrangements for the new 2008 concession. It is important that we secure the best deal for the taxpayer and reduce the burden placed on the industry. Any decision to make a change via an order will, of course, be after proper consultation and a regulatory impact assessment.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000150"></a>It is clearly premature to adopt the amendment at this stage. It is best to conclude this work by passing the Bill and making any changes through regulations rather than by seeking to pre-empt them, which the amendment would do. The amendments identify with total accuracy the problems of the national scheme that we have to confront and the impact of the scheme on local finances. I seek not to minimise those problems but to reassure the Committee that they have been anticipated effectively and that the Bill provides a framework in which the necessary regulations can work.</p>

I appreciate, as I am sure local authorities will, what he said about ensuring that the scheme is fully funded. Ultimately, we need a scheme that works for the passengers, that local authorities can afford to provide and that provides bus operators with a commercial opportunity. We need to recognise that, because this new scheme is being built on a scheme that was amended only a few months ago, and we are to a certain extent working on assumptions that may need to be reviewed if the scheme is to remain sustainable.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000152"></a>I am very keen to avoid the results of this scheme being added to the long list of matters on which local authorities are taking issue with central government, so that it does not become part of the annual ritual of local authorities saying, &#147;This is where we are short of money&#148;, and the Government saying, &#147;No, you are fine. Look, we have given you X amount of money&#148;. Although that may be quite good for scoring debating points, it would not achieve very many bus journeys if local authorities ended up cutting services, which is usually what happens when they are short of money.</p>

Nevertheless, the local authority there is as concerned as others are about this element of the Bill. I fear that there are a lot of problems with that concept.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000154"></a>Finally, like the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I am normally against ring-fencing, but there are occasions on which we must at least consider it. The noble Lord and I feel that this is different because we are now moving to a national scheme. If we were starting from a blank piece of paper, I imagine that the Government would introduce and run the scheme nationally. It would probably not be administered by local authorities in any event. Where local government is in effect acting as an agent for a central government scheme, as it is here, that makes us feel less sensitive about the notion of ring-fencing, because it does not restrict the scope of what a local authority can do. It is simply a mechanism to ensure that the funding is adequate.</p>

I said that the deliberately flexible regulation powers of the Bill appeared in Clause 3. They actually appear in Clause 9. I apologise for that slip and hope that the Committee will accept my apology.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000156"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07010813000308"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply and concur totally with what the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, said. I know that we are having a Comprehensive Spending Review next year and that there could be different systems of funding beyond the winter of 2008, but the basis of local government funding now was sorted out two or three years ago.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000157"></a>Essex, like all the southern counties, has a fixed-floor grant, so that, whatever happens, we get only 2.7 per cent. It therefore frustrates us enormously when the Government say that we have extra money, because we cannot have extra money. The Government say that they have included &#163;250 million for rail fares. Essex gets none of that because we get only 2.7 per cent regardless, and the same will be true next year. I do not think that many people understand that, but it frustrates me enormously when Ministers say that there is &#163;500 million here and &#163;400 million there when most of the counties get none of it. We get 2.7 per cent regardless. Although everyone else gets more than that, we get none of that money. When the Government impose new duties&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, said, this is a national scheme&#151;there must be some way of giving those who spend more money more money. All we will get next year is 2.7 per cent again. We know that now. There must be some new way of funding those new things. Otherwise, that builds up enormous problems. We cannot continue to absorb the extra cost of extra legislation at the level of 2.7 per cent. I do not think that many Ministers understand that. They think that they have given us money when they have not. We do not get any of it.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000158"></a>We all want this scheme to succeed, so money somehow needs to get directly to where things will happen. I am sure that we will come back to this matter. I cannot agree with the Minister, although I often do, that we must wait for regulation. We need to know where the Government are going on the funding of the scheme before we complete the legislation. We need to understand that the money

The free reserve scheme applies only to London and, in negotiating travel concessions, London Councils has to reach agreement with Transport for London for a scheme on its services by 31 December before the financial year of the scheme comes into effect.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000169"></a>If agreement is not reached, the statutory reserve scheme comes into effect at a cost determined by Transport for London. This puts London Councils at a disadvantage when negotiating with Transport for London, because Transport for London can determine the costs of the reserve scheme. Uniquely in London, the costs of the concessionary fares scheme are in effect determined by the operators who benefit, whereas elsewhere they are determined subject to appeal to the Secretary of State by the local authorities.

This, I grant, is an extremely complicated amendment which the Minister and officials may need to consider carefully, but it does appear that the free reserve scheme in London is redundant. It needs removing, and perhaps the Minister might like to consider this before we return to the Bill at a later stage. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000171"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07010813000310"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> As I was completing a 12,000-mile air trip yesterday, I had a nightmare that there might be at least one amendment that I would not understand at all. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has kindly provided that amendment. As he said, this is an extremely difficult issue, but he will rest assured that the all-seeing, all-knowing Government have talents at their disposal besides my own humble ones. Therefore, people have been working on this issue and can do rather better than he foresaw; namely, that we can give him some kind of answer, although not one that he will wholly approve of because we do not agree that his amendments, which seek to remove bus travel from the reserve free travel scheme that guarantees concessionary travel in London, are in the interests of either Londoners or the rest of the country.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000172"></a>The Committee will be well aware, because the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has already informed us, that the purpose of the reserve scheme is to ensure that, should there be no agreement between the London boroughs or between the boroughs and TfL on arrangements for concessionary travel in the capital, a fallback scheme guaranteeing certain minimum concessions applies. This arrangement has been in place since the Greater London Authority Act 1999. What the noble Lord suggests will not help. The amendments do not serve the interests of Londoners or, indeed, the interests of others from outside London who want to enjoy concessionary travel in the capital when the Bill becomes law.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000173"></a>The amendments would be to remove the fallback arrangements that guarantee the delivery of the national concession in the capital. I understand the argument the noble Lord puts on behalf of the local authorities. He said that it weakens the bargaining position of the local authorities vis-Ã -vis TfL because of the fallback position, but the proposed replacement for this guarantee would be the rolling-over of existing arrangements for another year.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000174"></a>If there are no arrangements offering the free concession on buses in London under Section 240(1) at the end of a year, then rolling the same arrangement on for a further year will make no difference: there will still be no arrangements for free bus travel. Amendments Nos. 24, 52 and 62 remove the obligation for free bus travel for eligible people at off-peak times on local bus services. Therefore, arrangements might offer a half discount with no consequences.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000175"></a>Under the legislation, there is no obligation to make arrangements under Section 240(1). They are voluntary. While at the moment the reserve travel scheme guarantees the national concession, if it were disapplied as envisaged, there would be no such guarantee. If no arrangements existed at the end of a

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000176"></a>Even if there were existing arrangements to roll over, this will still not guarantee free travel. The agreement specifying these arrangements is voluntary. There is nothing in the legislation which would prevent a party to the arrangements from terminating its agreement if it wanted to for whatever reason. It is also possible that the parties can vary the terms of the arrangements by agreement. They could, for example, agree only to offer half-price travel rather than free travel.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000177"></a>In summary, complex though the issue is, it comes down to a straightforward question of whether the amendments proposed by the noble Lord would be workable and in the interests of Londoners. I do not think that it would be right for us to rely on a voluntary agreement that could disappear at any time, and which includes terms that were not consistent with the national concession, which is the underlying principle of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000178"></a>I recognise where the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, is coming from. I see the force of his representation, but I fear that his amendments might have the most deleterious consequences for free travel in London just when we are seeking, under the Bill, to guarantee free travel across the nation. Therefore, I think that the Committee will recognise that I must oppose his amendments.</p>

Whereas it was the case that in London one or more boroughs could disagree and sabotage the scheme, there is now a system in place whereby there needs to be only a two-thirds majority of boroughs to agree the scheme. Usually that agreement is forthcoming. In the past, odd maverick boroughs objected. That system has now been supplanted in subsequent legislation. The legislation now is such that I believe&#151;I stand to be corrected&#151;that only two-thirds of the boroughs have to agree for a new arrangement to take place. Therefore, the reserve scheme is not necessary.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000180"></a>However, I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said. If indeed he is right, we will withdraw the amendment. If, indeed, I am right, then we would seek to return to the matter later.</p>

I just want to point out the obvious fact. The noble Lord is absolutely right that only a two-thirds majority is required. But I am absolutely right to say that if agreement was reached by those two-thirds, we would be in exactly the position I described. Whether it is unanimous, one holding a veto or two-thirds, if, as a consequence of the amendments, we end up with no concession scheme in London, I think that I am right to resist them.</p>

I have tabled the amendment as I am keen to probe the reason why the Government feel the need to keep such a power, albeit in reserve, in the Bill. I would also be grateful if the Minister could explain in what circumstances the Secretary of State would consider using such a power to take over the running of a national concessionary scheme. This will be a national scheme, but the Government&#146;s White Paper and all three national parties have said that we need to do things more locally rather than centrally. To nationalise this sort of thing at the moment would go totally against the grain of our attempts to make things happen more locally. We have talked about the problems of finance and I am sure that those might be resolved, so I see no need at all for the Secretary of State to take these powers, which are totally contrary to all the things that all three parties across both Houses of Parliament are trying to do at the moment. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain why we need this reserve power. I beg to move.</p>

I want at least to hear what the Minister has to say, but this power probably ought to remain in the Bill because it may be the best way in which to implement the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000202"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07010813000317"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, does not have to wait for the Minister to say something because he has expressed the argument more cogently than I could have done. I agree with him entirely.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000203"></a>I recognise the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that any powers accruing to a Secretary of State are to be investigated, examined and challenged in order to see whether they are in the national interest. We have no intention of implementing a national scheme on the basis of the Secretary of State taking responsibility for it but we are conscious of the fact, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, eloquently described, that these are complex operations. There are 291 authorities outside London and potentially each one could have to negotiate schemes with all operators in its area.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000204"></a>There is no doubt that the new national scheme will put a greater burden on administering authorities and involve more complex reimbursement arrangements. We are aware that many operators are reluctant to undertake so many negotiations; that they would prefer a single negotiation with government. Full centralisation would provide greater consistency in the level of reimbursement made to operators, which is why they are interested in it. But we have not accepted the argument that we need to implement the scheme on a centralised basis and do not intend to work that way if and when the Bill becomes law. We think it is right to preserve the power because to remove it would remove flexibility from the Bill against a background where we are not, and cannot be, entirely sure that the national scheme can be implemented on the basis of such a large number of potential negotiations being carried out.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000205"></a>Local government and bus operators have been working together for a number of years now, with a great deal of success in many areas, and there may well prove to be a satisfactory implementation of the scheme. No one will be happier than this Administration if that proves to be the case. We do not intend to implement the power unless we are forced to do so but, for ourselves and any future Administration, we cannot see the scheme fail through a breakdown of negotiations. We think it is right to have in the Bill a power for the Secretary of State to act if this important concept proves to be unrealisable through the other methods I have described. That is why I have spoken at great length, but with somewhat less conviction than the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, on why the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, should withdraw his amendment.</p>

I hope the Minister will forgive me if the answer is buried in the Bill. I am not sure about the negotiations over these concessionary schemes. I can see that each local authority can deal with its own local bus services but innumerable bus services criss-cross the country. These are national services which are nationally organised and nationally run. Is it the intention that each of the concessionary authorities will deal with these national companies&#151;for example, National Express&#151;on its own, or will there be some kind of central negotiation which will enable them all to come to the same arrangements in national travel schemes?</p>

<p><a name="07010813000207"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07010813000319"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> As I have indicated, the department does not see the Secretary of State playing that role. The way in which the structure evolves is for others to determine. I have not the slightest doubt that local authorities will see that it is in their interest, when they are dealing with a body like National Express, for some negotiations to take place on a broader basis than just each individual authority. In the first instance we are looking for the arrangements to be derived on that basis rather than a national scheme implemented by the Secretary of State. While I cannot quite call it a reserve power in the Bill, the Committee will recognise that we have here the potential for the Secretary of State to take responsibility for the scheme if we are not successful with our other arrangements. National Express is not a particularly good example because it largely runs coach rather than bus services, but I recognise what the noble Baroness says. Bus companies can be very big operators and a lot of complex negotiations will take place.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000208"></a>We start off on the premise that local authorities have developed their discretionary schemes over a period of time. They have a great deal of expertise at their disposal and they know the contours within which they are working. They will know the framework for reimbursement and the Bill provides for that. We will see how it goes. We merely think it wise to have a power for the Secretary of State within the framework of the Bill in case such arrangements do not work out.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000209"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07010813000320"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> I am not questioning the power particularly, which was raised by my noble friend Lord Hanningfield. It was just something that jumped up into my mind as we were going along, as the scheme is clearly being extended from local authorities out to those seeking to travel further afield. As I understand it, the noble Lord&#146;s expectation is that local authorities will come together where necessary to negotiate outside and beyond their current boundaries. This is something we may need to bottom out.</p>

It would be lovely for people to take advantage of the scheme and go to Aberdeen or wherever, and hopefully many will do so, but most of these journeys&#151;millions of

This is something that should be administered locally rather than nationally. Governments&#151;I am not talking about any particular government&#151;do not have a good record in delivering local services; local government has a much better record than when those services are nationalised. This scheme will work much better if it is delivered locally.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000211"></a>I do not know where the figure of 291 comes in, but it seems to be a lot. At Second Reading we looked at reducing the numbers in the counties, for example, by using the county as the transport agency rather than all the districts as well. There could be a way of simplifying that number. I spend my life doing this all the time. Local government can deliver this scheme rather better than setting up some national administration to do it, but I agree that we need reserve powers. Will the Minister slightly expand on the figure of 291 because it sounds like a lot of authorities? I am not certain how that works out. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, talked about the problems of money going to districts and counties having to get it back again. That mechanism probably needs to be simplified. Sorry to expand this topic, but as we are in Committee it is good idea to try and get some of these answers for further debate later on.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000212"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07010813000322"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Two hundred and ninety-one is the number of travel concession authorities outside London. They will not all be negotiating units.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000213"></a>The Government take pride in local authorities and we recognise the value of their work in this aspect of transport policy. However, a national scheme introduces a much more challenging dimension than that which has obtained in the past, but as the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has said, local authorities make sure that in all sorts of ways they come together and authorise someone to do the work on their behalf when it comes to negotiations with big providers.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000214"></a>We know also that the moment the scheme comes in, someone will travel from Brighton to Berwick for free by using their bus concession. They will get into the Guinness book of records as the first person to do it. Someone else will then do it faster and earn their own place in the record book. But a bus is not a coach, which does not stop as frequently as a bus, and in essence this is a scheme for local services. So of course it is right for us to say that local services ought to be negotiated by the local authority concerned. All we are doing with regard to this provision in the Bill is not abrogating that position; far from it&#151;that is not the basis on which we are doing this. However, it is a power we require in case things go wrong. There would be no point in introducing the Bill if it were not for the fact that the scheme itself is universally considered an asset to the nation.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010813000262"></a> Clause 9, page 7, line 13, at end insert &#147;, by allowing such appeals to be submitted at any time rather than 28 days after the commencement of a scheme as provided for by the 2000 Act&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000219"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the last amendment and I rise to move it in the fond hope that having given us no concessions at all this afternoon, the Minister may feel that I have hit upon something here which is an anomaly. At the moment, appeals have to be submitted within 28 days of the commencement of a scheme. That is a perilously short time during which neither the local authority nor the operator will have any idea of whether the scheme is a good or a bad one. The present rules on this state that unless an appeal is lodged within the first 28 days, it cannot be made. Earlier I gave figures for the use of bus services in Oxfordshire and I know very well that appeals were made. In the event, those appeals were withdrawn because the volume of business was much greater than had been anticipated either by the local authority or by the operator. But that will not always be the case. Other operators which have been badly affected have in fact been ruled out by the 28-day time limit. It is a very short period in which to judge the development of a bus business, one that depends on seasonal fluctuations and many other things.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000220"></a>The amendment provides that appeals can be &#147;submitted at any time&#148;. The Minister may decide that an appeal should be submitted with a certain period and I would accept that, but my main submission is that 28 days is far too short a time in which to make a sound judgment as to the efficacy of a scheme and the price at which it has been purchased. I ask the Minister at least to say that this is something that, in the light of our brief experience we have had of the operation of the scheme, he is prepared to look at again. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07010813000221"></a><b><a name="70108-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07010813000325"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, because he has identified an important issue. It is right that bus operators have the capacity to appeal the amount they are being reimbursed if they think it is unfair. There have been a number of appeals to the Secretary of State by bus operators against the level of reimbursement provided by local authorities for carrying concessionaires during this financial year, and a number have already been determined. The process has worked reasonably well, and it is fair, but I have no doubt that we could improve upon it, and I shall listen to those who present a case for changes to the appeal process.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000222"></a>I cannot support the principle of appeals being submitted at any time&#151;although the noble Lord may have kept the amendment open and wide in order for it to be probing. It is important that appeals are a last resort. We want the negotiations to succeed, and appeals to take place only when negotiations have effectively broken down. Allowing appeals at any time could risk undermining local negotiations, and the noble Lord will recognise the problems there. Any appeal creates some uncertainty for the local authority. Under the current arrangements, they know the magnitude of  


<notus-date day="8" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC37"></a><b>8 Jan 2007 : Column GC37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any claim at the end of the 28-day period, and can put appropriate contingency measures in place. The possibility of an appeal being submitted at any stage of the year would make it mighty difficult for local authorities. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, will recognise that point. Also, it is common legislative practice to set a deadline by which time appeals must be lodged. After all, there is a similar deadline in respect of appeals against reimbursement of discretionary schemes made by local authorities under the Transport Act 1985.</p>

<a name="70108-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07010813000223"></a>I do not think that the noble Lord&#146;s concept of open-ended appeals in Amendment No. 37 is acceptable, but I hear what he says: that he is just testing the Government at this stage. We are open-minded about this question. We have not been working the system for long, and there is no doubt that improvements can be effected. However, we would certainly continuously resist the concept of the open-ended appeal, which has profound implications for local authorities. No doubt the noble Lord will pursue this issue further.</p>

<a name="70108-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07010821000009"></a>The British Government will provide a further &#163;15 million to support the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) this financial year.</p>

<a name="70108-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07010821000010"></a>The AMIS force of 7,000 carries out vital operations in Darfur, and in very difficult circumstances. It relies upon the support of the international community to fund its operations, and the UK has been a leading contributor since its deployment.</p>

<a name="70108-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07010821000011"></a>A high-level consultation on Darfur was held in Addis Ababa on 16 November 2006. It concluded that the UN needs to provide increased support to AMIS, to enhance its effectiveness and ability to protect the civilians of Darfur and implement the Darfur peace agreement (DPA) signed on 5 May. This UN support will come in three phases, culminating in a joint AU/UN peacekeeping force of 17,000 with 3,000 police. This will require sustainable funding, and the UN Secretary-General will request that this comes from the UN. In the mean time, the AU Peace and Security Council met on 30 November: it endorsed the Addis Ababa conclusions and extended the mandate of AMIS for a further six months from 1 January. But this extension is conditional upon sufficient funding from the international community.</p>

<a name="70108-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07010821000012"></a>The African Union estimates the cost of extending AMIS's mandate to continue its current operations and to implement expansions under the DPA as $343 million (&#163; 175 million). Finding these funds will require a concerted international effort, and the UK is fully committed to playing its part. As an important donor to AMIS and in recognition of the urgent need to sustain its work, the UK will give a further &#163;15 million to support the force for its extended mandate.</p>

<a name="70108-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07010821000013"></a>This contribution puts the total British assistance to AMIS for this financial year to &#163;35 million. The previously committed &#163;20 million has been funding ground fuel contracts, airlift for Nigerian and Rwandan battalions and military observers. It also includes a cash contribution of &#163;13.5 million to cover personnel and catering costs for the period October to December. These are vital running costs for AMIS to continue its operations.</p>

<a name="70108-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07010821000014"></a>As well as taking a lead in committing UK funds, we are also encouraging other donors to make new pledges to sustain the mission.</p>

Symptoms are similar despite very different exposures to vaccination, nerve agent pre-treatment, smoke from oil fires and other possible hazards.

The Statement went on to explain that the previous HSMP rules were being suspended and why: we took these steps to avoid a rush of speculative applications by people who would wish their applications to be considered under the old rules, which is what happened after the publication of the Command Paper on the points-based system. The suspension was to enable us to make the transition effectively to the new rules and to ensure that current levels of customer service were maintained when the new arrangements were introduced. In the interests of good customer service, we made sure that this would not disadvantage applicants substantively. The changes came into effect on 5 December 2006.</p>

We believe that the NHS overall remains broadly on track to deliver net financial balance by the end of 2006-07 and continues to perform well against key service targets.</p>

<a name="70108w0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_141"></a><a name="07010824000381"></a>The contingency in 2006-07 has not been created from new funding provided by the department. As part of their management of the &#163;5.5 billion central budget bundle distributed to them for the NHS, SHAs have established a level of contingency which currently stands at &#163;350 million. This contingency is a prudent approach by SHAs to manage financial risk in the NHS while ensuring that services to patients are delivered.</p>

<a name="70108w0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_142"></a><a name="07010824000382"></a>There are a number of factors, not yet included in the NHS forecasts, which may have beneficial impact on the forecast outturn position. The most significant is the potential benefit arising from the lower reimbursement cost of generic medicines.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_143"></a><a name="07010824000383"></a>There will be redundancies resulting from the strategic health authority and primary care trust reorganisation which will release &#163;250 million to front line services.

In addition to current building programmes, 8,000 places were announced in the CJS review in July 2006. These places will be completed over the next six years through a mixture of expansions at existing prisons and building a number of new prisons.</p>

This is because Ministers decided that it would be more effective to include a clause in the body of the funding agreement stipulating that the Secretary of State must be notified of any meeting at which the appointment of an academy principal will be considered, that a representative of the Secretary of State will be entitled to attend that meeting and that their views will be taken into account. This clause was introduced when we updated the model funding agreement earlier this year; where individual funding agreements do not include it we are currently seeking to re-negotiate this with academy trusts.</p>

<a name="07010824000771"></a><b><a name="70108w0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07010824001934"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The composition and operation of governing bodies of local education authority maintained schools are set out under Chapter 1 of Part 3 of the Education Act 2002. In many respects the model funding agreement includes provisions equivalent to these and governing bodies of academies would be expected to carry out the same accountability, challenge, support and monitoring functions as governing bodies of maintained schools.</p>

<a name="70108w0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_843"></a><a name="07010824000772"></a>However, the requirements and duties of academy governors do differ from maintained school governors because academies are conducted by charitable companies limited by guarantee (the academy trust) and the governors are the directors of those companies. Their powers and duties are therefore governed by the memorandum of association and articles of association of the academy trust and are subject to the general law relating to limited companies and the law relating to charities.</p>

<a name="70108w0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_844"></a><a name="07010824000773"></a>Within these constraints academy governing bodies do have a number of additional freedoms beyond those available to maintained schools, including voluntary aided schools. For instance, they are not obliged to adhere to the school teachers pay and conditions document or the national curriculum.</p>

The Compensation Act 2006 provides a robust statutory framework for the regulation of claims management services, including claims made for personal injury handled by previously unregulated third-party claims companies. Such companies will now need to be authorised and required to follow strict rules of conduct including how claims are obtained and referred to solicitors.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010824001596"></a>&#147;The Government strongly supports the principle enshrined in the WHO constitution that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being. However, there are difficulties over Taiwan's involvement in a United Nations forum where statehood is a prerequisite for full membership. Additionally, observer status, of and by itself does not automatically confer any rights or benefits on the holder.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07010824001597"></a>Consequently, the Government's approach has been to press for practical solutions. The Government, both bilaterally and through the EU, has sought to strengthen and deepen the relationship between the WHO and Taiwan. The EU has urged the WHO Secretariat to find mechanisms to allow medical and public health officials from Taiwan to participate in relevant activities of the WHO. Through the Secretariat's efforts, Taiwan is more involved now than before. We continue to monitor the situation closely&#148;.</p>
