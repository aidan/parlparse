The question of public confidence in the privacy of proceedings has certainly been discussed and embraced in the consultation papers that the Government have put out in the past two years. Clearly, protecting children&#146;s privacy is a paramount consideration here, but of course the court has to strike a balance between protecting children and young persons, the general interest in open administration and individuals&#146; claims to be present. That is why the consultation paper concluded that we should see whether more written information could be made available, but in all these matters the paramount interest of the child must come to the fore.</p>

As noble Lords will be aware, the 2006 consultation paper contained a proposal to allow more open access to the media. However, in the ensuing months, in discussions with children&#146;s organisations and at various meetings and events arranged with children who have been through care proceedings, a very strong view came back from the children that privacy was indeed paramount.

Our key target is that 100 per cent of patients shall be offered an appointment to be seen in one of those clinics within 48 hours, if the need arises.

At the moment, there is no age limit from a pharmacy perspective, but we envisage that it will be compatible with supplying the morning-after pill, which is 16.

Perhaps I may ask him yet another question. How many other legal actions are in prospect because of substandard living conditions and how many more prison wings face closure because of those actions?</p>

I answer for the DWP because I have ministerial responsibility for the Health and Safety Executive generally and for the broad issues we are discussing. I have a note of the censures that have been levied in respect of the Prison Service in recent years. There is nothing beyond 2004 on the list that I have before me, but, again, I shall get a detailed answer to the point raised by the noble Lord.</p>

It commits to enabling people to live independently within their communities, maintaining as much choice and control as possible. It will empower citizens to shape their own lives and the services they receive. It does not seek to establish a uniform system across the country.

The Statement is as follows:</p>
 &#147;With the support, I know, of the whole House, I start by paying tribute to our Armed Forces, both in Afghanistan and elsewhere. They are doing vital work, giving so much every day in dangerous places in the service of our country. Let me particularly pay tribute to the 86 British servicemen and women who have lost their lives in Afghanistan, 42 of them this year alone. I know the whole House will join me in honouring the memory of the fallen and saluting the courage of our military and our civilian personnel.&#147;Let me, on the morning of the capture of Musa Qaleh, praise the professionalism and resolve of our forces in recent days. They have helped defeat the insurgents and, in a vital district of Afghanistan, restored peace. Let me make it clear at the outset that as part of a coalition we are winning the battle against the Taliban insurgency. We are isolating and eliminating the leadership of the Taliban. We are not negotiating with them.&#147;For six years, 38 countries have come together with the people and Government of Afghanistan to rebuild the failed state, to prevent the return of the Taliban and to root out al-Qaeda. I can tell the House that Britain will continue to meet our obligations and honour our commitments, discharging our duties to this task and to the people of Afghanistan. &#147;Having been reviewing our strategy since July, I now want to announce the next stage. It is a long-term and comprehensive framework for security, political, social and economic development for Afghanistan. This long-term comprehensive framework entails, first, more Afghan ownership: the Afghan army, police and Government building on NATO military achievements and taking over more responsibility for their own security. Secondly, we support localisation and then reconciliation: Afghans building on the creation of a democratic constitution by developing and strengthening their institutions, not just at national but at provincial and local level, as we support their search for political reconciliation. &#147;The third aspect is reconstruction. In what is still one of the poorest countries on earth, where only one in three has clean drinking water, where life expectancy is just 43, and where 80 per cent of  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_234"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>women cannot yet read, we will help to ensure, through reconstruction and development, that more Afghan people have an economic stake in their future. &#147;Fourthly, and to underpin this great burden-sharing by all partners and allies, each of us playing our part, as hard-headed realists not idealists, in the long haul to help the Afghans themselves govern and secure their own land&#151;together, shifting our emphasis from short-term stabilisation to long-term development. &#147;The foundation, now and in the future for our comprehensive framework of support for Afghanistan, is military support for the Afghan Government and denying al-Qaeda a base from which to launch attacks on the world. Throughout last winter, Taliban propagandists repeatedly promised a spring offensive. Instead, it is the British and other NATO forces, together with the Afghan army, who have taken the initiative. We have been driving the insurgents and extremists out of their hiding places, preventing them regrouping and attacking the areas around the provincial capitals where stability is now taking hold. &#147;It is this military success that has preserved Afghanistan&#146;s emerging democracy. It is a constitution fragile but still intact, a free media and a changing society where unlike six years ago, when women were banned from education, work and virtually all of public life, now there is a higher proportion of women MPs than in many western countries; and 5 million children are at school&#151;2 million of them girls once denied an education.&#147;We need to hold and to reinforce what together we have achieved. So Britain will maintain a strong military force in Afghanistan, of around today&#146;s figure of 7,800. It is a contribution, second in size only to America. We will increase support for our forces. I can announce today, fully funded from the reserve, 150 new protected patrol vehicles specially procured for Afghanistan, bringing to 400 the total of new protected vehicles bought in the past 18 months for Iraq and Afghanistan together. We will combine this with an increasing number of Sea King helicopters in Afghanistan and through NATO negotiating new contracts for hiring commercial helicopters to move routine freight, freeing up military helicopters for military tasks.&#147;However, because we know that military success is only one part of the framework&#151;a necessary but not sufficient condition for progress&#151;we will train Afghan forces to take ownership of their own security. Next year, we will aim for 70,000 trained Afghan soldiers, 20,000 more than now, supported by a rising number of British trainers and mentors&#151;340&#151;part of an overall NATO training force of more than 6,000. Already the Afghan army is proving itself in Musa Qaleh.&#147;But the challenge of supporting an Afghan lead on security goes wider than the armed forces. It includes the police, courts and prisons. Here we are dealing with decades of failure and corruption. Progress has been slow. By March 2008, there will be more than 800 international police trainers,  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_235"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 235</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including 65 police from Britain. This must be matched with a wider effort across civil society, which we will continue to support, on judges, courts and prisons&#151;working with the grain of Afghan traditions but within international norms. One way forward is to increase our support for community defence initiatives, where local volunteers are recruited to defend homes and families modeled on traditional Afghan arbakai.&#147;To ensure that longer term political and economic objectives are the guiding force behind the security campaign, we have brought the British civilian and military personnel together into a co-located headquarters. We will continue to strengthen their integration and at the same time we will recruit and deploy more specialists who speak the local languages and understand the tribal dynamics. &#147;But again the Afghans themselves must be persuaded to take the lead in improving local and national government. On my recent visit, I saw the scale of the challenge but also the opportunity and the importance of our support. I can announce today that, from our Afghan aid programme, which has already spent &#163;490 million in six years, Britain will fund two additional programmes for local government. The first will help the Afghans to create stronger provincial and local governance, including building the capacity of the Directorate of Local Governance and supporting civil society groups to hold local government to account. The second will offer more support for the national solidarity programme, which builds the capacity of local communities to run their own development projects. As a measure of the importance that we attach to stability in building local capacity, we will immediately move infrastructure projects forward in Musa Qaleh, which we have recaptured and on which we wish to build from firmer foundations. They will include a cash-for-work programme for up to 10,000 people and plans to rebuild and refurbish the district centre, the main high school and four mosques.&#147;Our objective is to defeat the insurgency by isolating and eliminating its leadership. I make it clear that we will not enter any negotiations with those people. I have also made it clear on countless occasions, most recently in Afghanistan, that our objective is to root out those who preach and practise violence and murder in support of men and women of peace. President Karzai&#146;s message to former insurgents is that if they are prepared to renounce violence, abide by the constitution and respect human rights, there is a place for them in the legitimate society and economy of Afghanistan. He and his Ministers told me this week that some 5,000 fighters have already laid down their arms. We will support President Karzai and his Government in their efforts to reconcile all parties to Afghanistan&#146;s democratic constitution. &#147;We know also that Afghanistan will never be stable without the constructive engagement of its neighbours. During my visit, President Karzai agreed on the need for greater regional co-operation. We continue to work with the Afghan and Pakistan

I urged President Karzai to turn the current ad hoc meetings and structures that he has with Pakistan and other countries into more substantive mechanisms to bring stability and security to the region. &#147;The third priority is reconstruction and development, always at its most challenging where poverty is combined with insecurity and insurgency, but a strong long-term commitment to which is vital for the Afghan Government if they are to take responsibility successfully for the future of their country. I can announce to the House today that, in total, Britain will make available &#163;450 million in development and stabilisation assistance for Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012. This money will cover both short-term priorities and long-term objectives. &#147;When I was in Afghanistan and met local business leaders, President Karzai and I agreed a comprehensive plan, to be taken forward jointly by the Afghan and British Governments and the Aga Khan Development Network, to attract private sector investment into the country and stimulate new businesses. A new growth fund, starting with an initial &#163;30 million, will kick-start the development of basic legal and regulatory frameworks, build government capacity to involve the private sector in providing public services, and pilot business training programmes. This will be led by a council of Ministers, business representatives and other experts, who will build contacts with the private sector inside and outside Afghanistan. They will advise the Government on how to increase investment and economic growth, and monitor the progress being made. We will also provide an additional &#163;10 million for small loans that will be of special help particularly to women to start up or expand businesses. Seventy per cent of the initial applicants have been women.&#147;Our long-term objective is to support Afghanistan&#146;s own national development strategy by channelling our aid through the Afghan Government and what we believe is the best route to achieving sustainable progress as well as the best value for money. We shall do so on a long-term basis, helping the Afghans plan ahead and, with good governance, focus on their own priorities: economic growth, health and education, and rural livelihoods.&#147;However, we also recognise the need for short-term and high-impact stabilisation projects&#151;better roads, more reliable power supplies, clean water and sanitation&#151;which make an immediate difference to the lives of ordinary Afghan citizens and show them the benefits of improved security and governance. So part of the &#163;450 million I announce today will help to fund Britain&#146;s new cross-government unit, which has Afghanistan as its first priority. A global budget of &#163;260 million will drive forward reconstruction projects over the next three years, and provide expert civilian support to rebuild basic services. &#147;Afghans cannot hope for stability while the poison of the narcotics trade continues to flourish, so Britain, Afghanistan&#146;s lead partner-nation in

While the situation with the poppy crop in Helmand is difficult, it must be our aim to match the progress achieved in the rest of Afghanistan, where the number of poppy-free provinces has increased from six to 13 through a combination of stronger governance, targeted eradication, which I urged President Karzai to move forward, disruption of traffickers, strengthening the justice system and promoting legitimate agriculture.&#147;We will continue to work with our partners who have proved steadfast in Afghanistan. I welcome the recent announcements from Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Germany and Estonia that they will maintain or increase their troop numbers. This progress must now be matched by contributions from other countries in NATO, the European Union and beyond. We are talking to all our partners to address the immediate need for more training teams for the Afghan security forces, especially the police. We are having detailed talks with a number of countries on more support helicopters, which are needed. Where countries are unable to deploy their own troops or equipment, we are urging them to look at innovative ways to burden share and help fund those countries which can provide troops and equipment. &#147;Having described the challenges we face in Afghanistan, I have set out our long-term commitment. It is to build on the military progress made so far by helping the Afghans take greater leadership across security, governance and economic development. Because this priority and the need for a more consistent, integrated and co-ordinated international approach are now recognised across our partners, Britain continues to push for the next step in this process: the appointment of a strong UN envoy to bring greater coherence across the international effort in security, governance and development&#151;and to relationships with the Afghan government. &#147;Britain will continue to fulfil its obligations to the Afghan people and the international community. We will support the Afghan army, police and Government as they progressively take over greater responsibility for their own security. We will work with our international partners and help the Afghans themselves strengthen stability, foster democracy and build prosperity. At all times we will support the hard work, dedication, professionalism and courage of our Armed Forces who are doing everything in their power to defeat terrorism and to lay the foundations of a stable and secure future for Afghanistan. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07121264000097"></a>One of the great differences between this House and another place is that many noble Lords have served in the Armed Forces. A significant number have seen active service. This House has little illusion about the ugliness of war. These are very taxing operations against a determined and astute enemy. Can the noble Baroness convey to the forces involved the support of the whole House, our admiration for their efforts in Musa Qala and our prayers for their safe and honoured return? When the noble Baroness replies, perhaps she could set out the full cost of the Afghan operation, not only in the 86 lives so far lost, but in other casualties and in money spent and committed.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07121264000098"></a>We welcome the latest successes against the Taliban. We note that the Prime Minister says that we are winning the war, so can the noble Baroness set out, in the plainest possible terms, the strategic purpose of our long-term presence in Afghanistan? When will we have succeeded and how will we measure that success? The country and our forces need to understand that very clearly.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07121264000099"></a>The Statement talks of this being a long-term commitment. How long-term will that be? Are we ready to stay there for years, perhaps decades, if need be? As I recall, before the Iraq imbroglio, we joined a coalition attack on Afghanistan as the first phase of a war on terror after the shocking atrocity at the World Trade Centre. Our declared objectives then were to root out al-Qaeda, capture bin Laden and remove the Taliban from power. I will first ask about al-Qaeda. Are we still involved in a war on terror? Will that phrase pass the noble Baroness's lips as it used to pass Mr Blair&#146;s? If this is a war on terror&#151;and given the plans for diminishing civil liberties here at home coming from this Government, one assumes that it is&#151;what further deployments beyond the Afghan theatre are we prepared to consider in fighting al-Qaeda? What have our Armed Forces the capacity to consider?</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07121264000100"></a>Yesterday, al-Qaeda boasted of a new murderous outrage in Algiers. Our sincere sympathies go to the Algerian people and to the United Nations. Where, in the Government&#146;s assessment, is al-Qaeda now training? Is all training in Afghanistan now eliminated? What about the impact of Pakistan on Afghan operations? Is there not still evidence of heavy al-Qaeda activity there? Is Pakistan still serving as a base for equipping, recruiting and supporting terrorists against Her Majesty's Armed Forces? If so, how can the Government ensure that the Afghan arm of the war will be won given the current instability in Pakistan?</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07121264000101"></a>Will the noble Baroness tell the House if there is evidence of Iran supporting terrorist activities in Afghanistan? Where in Africa is it thought that al-Qaeda is now training? Are the Government prepared to join in action against training bases in that continent&#151;after all, if in Afghanistan then why not there? Where is the benefit of winning the battle in Afghanistan only to renounce the challenge elsewhere?</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07121264000102"></a>Turning to bin Laden and the al-Qaeda leadership, is there any prospect that they will be apprehended? On the final original objective in Afghanistan, the removal of the Taliban, how far are we succeeding in that? The House will have noted and welcomed the

How does that compare with the situation after the initial securing of the Karzai Government? How many provinces, particularly in Pashtun areas, are under the effective control of the Karzai Government? How many are not? Is our aim to help the Afghan Government to secure total control of the country? If not, how will we judge success?</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07121264000103"></a>In Helmand province, our troops have been doing a miraculous job; sometimes with a scandalous lack of helicopters and other equipment. The announcements of extra equipment in the Statement today are of course extremely welcome, but are they not years too late?</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07121264000104"></a>Is it the intention to garrison Musa Qala after the battles of recent days? We welcome the role of United States and Estonian forces alongside our troops, but how many other NATO countries are in war-fighting operations? Although I agree entirely with the Prime Minister that others need to do more, what prospect realistically is there of securing any help from the unwilling? Perhaps we can expect some good news out of the EU summit this weekend and the Prime Minister will no doubt be able to report back on that on Monday afternoon.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07121264000105"></a>We welcome some of the proposals for reconstruction announced today, but how can we be assured that this generous support from the British people will not be wasted in corruption? The Statement mentioned opium production, but what proportion of the world&#146;s opium still comes from Afghanistan, and how much is produced in Helmand province? It was staggering to read in the press this morning that we were now going to talk to the Taliban. That has now been categorically denied by the Prime Minister, but what was the origin of that report? Will there be a searching inquiry? Such confusing messages and foolish spin in wartime can literally be deadly to our troops.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07121264000106"></a>There is much that is welcome in the Statement&#151;some that is, frankly, too late and some perhaps quite optimistic&#151;but we wish the programme well. The House and the world must know what is our long-term strategic objective and how that fits into the worldwide battle against terrorism. Without that unremitting focus, all the heroism and sacrifice of our troops could end in failure and that would be the greatest betrayal of all.</p>

It is sobering to think that Gladstone would probably have recognised most of the analysis and problems, for the history of Afghanistan has been one of sucking in, involving and frustrating great empires. Nevertheless, I thank the noble Baroness the Lord President for the Statement. I associate myself with the tributes paid by noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, both to the dead and to those returning from war zones with injuries that they will carry for the rest of their lives. The Prime Minister&#146;s frontline visit is also extremely welcome. We all pay tribute to the professionalism, courage and bravery of British service personnel.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_240"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71212-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07121264000108"></a>The strategy and the length of time are worrying. It is very brave to say that we are isolating and eliminating, and not negotiating, but how much has changed since the Defence Select Committee&#146;s scathing analysis of the military situation in Afghanistan? I echo the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde: one of the problems in winning the hearts and minds of the British people to this venture is the puzzlement that if we are fighting a just cause against a monstrous enemy&#151;and anybody who looks at the Taliban&#146;s record as is spelt out in the Statement would share that analysis&#151;then why are so few of our allies willing to come to the sharp end with us and fight the battle? It is damaging to the whole cause. The Prime Minister&#146;s statement in the other place that he will raise the question at the NATO meeting in Romania at Easter lacks urgency. I welcome the suggestion from the Conservative Benches and hope that the Prime Minister raises the prospect of greater EU co-operation at the EU summit. More enthusiasm from him about defence co-operation might help.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07121264000109"></a>Have we really got a hearts-and-minds strategy that is fully co-ordinated and targeted? That will be important, if we are going to stick with this for any length of time. We are told that the problem of the poppy crop is difficult. There is some element of being dammed if we do and damned if we don&#146;t deal with it ruthlessly. The Statement does not offer any direct solutions, other than Helmand is particularly difficult. It is not just the overall level of defence spending that has been raised, but also the question of whether we are concentrating that spending in the right areas to guarantee the equipment for fighting this type of war.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07121264000110"></a>Finally, the Statement underlines the need to involve neighbours. We know of the problems in Pakistan. This also raises the issue of Iran. Is Iran part of the problem, as the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, seemed to suggest, or is it part of the solution? We certainly need to explore what can be done with Iran. I am not optimistic. When such Statements are made, there is always a temptation for the House to rally around the flag and the troops. However, when we in Parliament send troops into such a dangerous and bleak land with such a dangerous and bleak history, we have a duty to be absolutely sure that we know how long we are sending them for and what we are asking them to do. As my noble friend Lord Ashdown has repeatedly pointed out, there is the need for a policy directed towards hearts and minds that matches the military effort, because the military effort alone cannot solve this problem.</p>

I agree with everything that they have said in paying tribute not only to those who have lost their lives and to their families but also to those who have been wounded in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07121269000003"></a>I do not believe that the objectives that we set out with in 2001 have changed. We are trying to ensure that the Taliban cannot be returned to power and that we deny al-Qaeda a physical base in Afghanistan. The  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_241"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>good news is that the people of Afghanistan have voted in their democratic elections and that there will be more national and provincial elections in the future. We see a fledgling democracy at work in that country, which is very important.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07121269000004"></a>We are realistic about what we are seeking to do. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, is right to ensure that we have a calm perspective on what we are seeking to achieve in Afghanistan. I pay tribute to all 38 countries that are working with us and undertaking a variety of different tasks. Some, like Canada, have troops on the ground and others have provided expertise and back-up support in a headquarters focus. We are working as a team but that does not mean, as both noble Lords have indicated, that we should not do more to try to ensure that other partners play their part in the work in Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07121269000005"></a>I also agree with what has been said about Pakistan where we hope that the situation is improving. There are 2,600 miles of border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which raises huge issues about the practicalities of policing the border. There are perhaps even more important issues about the way in which neighbours have to work together on the border issues, directly for the national governments and directly for the localities near the borders. It is true that Iran needs to play its part. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence is optimistic&#151;that has been made clear to me in my discussions with him&#151;about how far the Afghan national army has come since his last visit and certainly since his very first visit some 18 months ago. He described it to me as being rather like night and day, but that does not mean that there is not a lot more to do. The development of the Afghan national army is extremely important to the future.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07121269000006"></a>I agree with much of what has been said about ensuring that we are working effectively in that country. I hope we will all agree that it is important to continue with that project. Over time, we must evaluate how long we will need to be there.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07121269000007"></a>On a very specific area, the model that we are following for the eradication of the narcotics trade is based on experience, particularly in countries such as Thailand, where noble Lords will be aware that it took 15 years to ensure that that trade was eradicated. That feels like a long time in some ways but in other ways it seems like a very short time. There is the eight-pronged approach by the Afghan Government to try to tackle the narcotics trade, which ranges from high-profile moves towards bringing to justice those who take part in the trade through to the programme of eradication on the ground and the opportunities for alternatives.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07121269000008"></a>In Helmand province, for example, which is an incredibly fertile area, it is very important to try to ensure that farmers grow other crops. That needs to be done in a diverse way rather than simply thinking about one alternative. It is also very important to provide the security for the future that will enable people to make real choices about their lives.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07121269000009"></a>As for the money being spent, the overall defence budget is 2.3 per cent of GDP by 2010. That does not include the spending on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Treasury reserve has provided &#163;6.6 billion since 2001. I do not have with me the breakdown  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_242"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between the two countries. I am more than happy to supply that to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and to put a copy in the Library but it is being funded from the reserve.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07121269000010"></a>It is important, too, that we look at the moves that have been made forward since 2001 in a country that had 30 years of Soviet occupation and Taliban rule, both in terms of democratic elections and the importance of the military presence, and also in terms of trying to work with civil society to develop health, education and economic growth. The successes outlined in the Statement, not least for the women and children of Afghanistan, point to that. Some of the practical points in the Statement about the loans and grants that can be made available to support fledgling enterprise in all of the provinces of Afghanistan will be very important too.</p>

<a name="71212-0003.htm_para21"></a>

We must provide the underpinning to enable economic growth to take place. Those are the factors that will lead to success in Afghanistan but we must realise that this is difficult and that we have a longer term commitment. We cannot put a timescale on it for obvious reasons but we must provide the support for the people that noble Lords would wish to see.</p>

Earlier this week I, together with other Members of your Lordships&#146; House, met a team of officials from the Ministry of Counternarcotics in Afghanistan. They spoke very frankly. I was completely astonished with what they said about the degree, the depth and the spread of corruption in that country. They apparently have extremely hard evidence, including video evidence, of certain warlords who are now drug lords and who are dealing in drugs and are involved in corruption. However, they cannot be brought to court simply because they are so close to the Government. There is also evidence that those who were in the pay of various donors during the Cold War&#151;the mujaheddin, the warlords&#151;are themselves becoming drug lords and are still being paid by donors. So the corruption is not merely within the country; it also stretches outside the country and may well involve the donors. I have heard from several sources of a particular individual who has bought up a large amount of land in the south and will allow only poppies to be cultivated on that land when he gives it out to various villagers. I have also heard that if the leader of a village&#151;or &#147;khan&#148;&#151;is prepared to forbid poppy cultivation, then poppy cultivation will cease. Can the Minister say something about any new ideas the Government may have about dealing with the disease of corruption rather than the symptom of poppy cultivation and what kind of collaboration are they pursuing with Europe and America?</p>

She will know from meeting those involved in counternarcotics that 13 provinces are poppy-free&#151;an increase from six in 2006, so some progress is being made. The noble Baroness&#146;s points about corruption in Afghanistan are well made. There are serious difficulties. One piece of work within the EU, initially led by the Italians, looked at how one can deal with issues of corruption. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in his Statement, we need to look carefully at the role of the courts and seek to bring to justice high-profile drug dealers. We need to send the kind of messages that we have spurred on our colleagues in other parts of the world to send, not only to make the point but to ensure that people can see that those who deserve it are brought to justice. The noble Baroness is absolutely right to say that this area of work will take some time and we are working closely with European Union colleagues and the United States to ensure that we can achieve our aims. We are also giving support in this area to the police forces and the courts system.</p>

<p><a name="07121269000091"></a>Can the noble Baroness tell us whether, in light of the scope of the Statement, the Government will publish a paper setting out in greater detail the strategy that they envisage under the four headings, or, at least, provide a debate in the House on some of those issues? Many people have said that some of those are optimistic, while some are certainly controversial and relatively untested. My concern is with the increase in support for community defence initiatives. Will the noble Baroness reassure the House that, while community initiatives are very much to be welcomed, community defence initiatives are what in a feudal, male-dominated, authoritarian society led to the rise of the Taliban in the first place? I am sure the noble Baroness is aware that the Taliban first arose as students, pupils and teachers of the &#147;righteous path&#148; to civic organisation. This kind of initiative would just give that back in the absence of the entrenchment of the rule of law.</p>

On community defence initiatives, it is, indeed, important to remember from whence the Taliban came and to be aware of the kind of justice that they offer&#151;albeit quick and not always appropriate. It is also important, in thinking through how we work with the Afghan people, to bear in mind the cultural and religious framework in which the society of Afghanistan operates, to make sure that we mesh with that very appropriately and to be aware of what people are seeking and how they look for it. As for publishing a paper, it is beyond my pay grade to answer that properly, but I will seek to get an answer. As for a debate, it is more than my life is worth with my Chief Whip to offer anything, but the noble Baroness makes her point and I am sure that the usual channels will be willing to consider that.</p>

I want to ask my noble friend about a quite different issue&#151;women in Afghanistan. Under the Taliban women particularly suffered from a lack of education and from being denied access to jobs. I was pleased to hear in the Statement about the opportunities for microfinancing for women and other parts of the community. Can my noble friend tell us any more about what is being done to help women to re-enter the workforce in Afghanistan and to help them become doctors and teachers? Women were denied access and suffered under the Taliban in those spheres. What provision is being made for widows or those who live without the protection of a male member of the family, who have also had an extraordinarily rough time under the Taliban?</p>

A number of initiatives are taking place. I described the microfinance one, but we are also providing interpreters where possible to support women in the local communities. In addition, are seeking to involve women in their communities through the NGO framework and to provide support with education and training. I do not have to hand the specific information on doctors but I shall ensure that my noble friend gets an answer and that it is placed in the Library of the House, together with information on teachers. I understand that initiatives are taking place but I do not have the details with me. In relation to widows, one important factor in supporting women is recognising the circumstances that apply, particularly in the rural communities in Afghanistan. I am happy to report to the House the details of the work that is going on in that regard.</p>

It is a comfort to see on the Front Bench noble Lords from all three of the departments concerned. It shows that there is true commitment in this House. A metaphor comes to mind: if Tony Blair had Iraq on his back as an albatross, perhaps we should hope that the new Prime Minister is being guided by a swan into the calmer waters of Afghanistan. I shall not give him all the credit because our new ambassador has shown a remarkable enthusiasm for hearts and minds, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said. This is a new direction. Given that the Statement was 15 minutes long, I hope that we will have the opportunity of a full debate. This is an exceptionally important subject for the whole country and we want to explore all the aspects beyond defence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07121269000019"></a>Perhaps I may take up one point by way of a question and by way of a warning. There is a new enthusiasm for administrative reform in strengthening institutions in Afghanistan, but we should beware of a new level of bureaucracy. There are many effective channels of development at the moment, in which, naturally, because of my own background, I include

My colleagues on the Front Bench are here specifically to demonstrate to the House that the Government are working across the different departments to ensure that we deliver appropriately in the way that I described. There is a need to build military capacity and to support the Afghan army, civil society, economic development and growth, and democracy. All those things need to fit together and that requires the Government to think strategically with regard to themselves as well as in their approach to the country. I agree with what the noble Earl said about bureaucracy. It is important to get this right. In our aid programmes, we work directly through the Afghan Government, who work directly with local communities. One facet of that is to ensure that the NGO civic society on the ground is able to hold its own Government to account. That is a very important check and balance on the way that governments operate. I make no apologies for the Statement lasting for 15 minutes because, as the noble Earl said, this is an important matter.</p>

The town that was mentioned was freed some months ago. The Taliban ran back across the border to their hideout in Pakistan and then they came back, and they will do the same again. It appears to me that, until we get military co-operation with Pakistan&#146;s forces, any battles that are won will be negative as long as the Taliban have a safe place to go and come back from.</p>

There have been recent meetings between Pakistan and Afghanistan to discuss a number of issues. The border between the countries is huge and one must bear in mind the difficulties that that in itself creates. It is a question of trying to build confidence on both sides so as to deal effectively with the broader issues. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary would be the first to say that we continue to make efforts to ensure that Pakistan is able to support the work going on in Afghanistan. When thinking of Afghanistan, it is important to think of the neighbourhood and to ensure that we are working with partners in it.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07121269000092"></a> Clause 25, page 26, line 22, leave out from &#147;is&#148; to &#147;made&#148; in line 23</p>
</ul>
<a name="71212-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07121269000035"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment relates to aspects of the clause which relate to confidentiality. Restrictions on patient confidentiality significantly over and above expected medical confidentiality currently apply to couples seeking infertility treatment through IVF-related procedures even when donated gametes&#151;sperm or eggs&#151;are not required. Not only are those restrictions excessive but the penalties for breaching them are draconian. Under Section 41(5) of the 1990 Act, breach of this confidentiality is a criminal offence punishable by prison, a fine or both.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07121269000036"></a>There is inequity in how the clause treats patients, set out in Section 33(1) and 33(5) of the 1990 Act, because it does not apply to patients seeking infertility investigations or treatment in their local hospitals but only to HFEA-licensed premises and HFEA clinicians who work or have worked in licensed centres and to IVF-related procedures. It does not apply to treatments that are not licensable by the HFEA, such as drug treatments or surgery on either male or female patients. Confidentiality restrictions may thus change as a patient moves between the treatments offered.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07121269000037"></a>In 1990, IVF treatment may have been viewed as something artificial and novel, with babies created in test tubes. Therefore, Parliament concluded that most patients would not want it known that their child had been born by that process. Clearly, since it did not apply to patients having other forms of fertility treatment such as surgery, it was not the fact of needing such treatment that was of concern, and needed to be kept ring-fenced, but simply the fact that they were using IVF.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07121269000038"></a>Today, every newspaper and women&#146;s magazine seems to have an article about infertility and treatment using IVF technology, with an increasing number of women declaring that that is how they conceived. Why IVF should be seen in law as something to be ashamed of, and hence kept ultra secret to a level punishable by prison, is not clear. The only other branches of medical practice that have such unreasonable restrictions and penalties applied relate to the Gender Recognition Act or, for public safety purposes, in cases of infectious diseases. Indeed, the initial and even more severe restrictions placed in 1990 were all so unreasonable and unworkable that the law had to be modified in 1992 to make it remotely practicable. As it stands, the current law still imposes an unreasonable burden on both patient and practitioner.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07121269000039"></a>It seems to be assumed that patients seeking fertility treatment always go to independent specialist fertility centres where all forms of treatment are offered under the same roof with the same set of notes. Although that may be true of private units, many of the best fertility services are offered as part of routine care being delivered by expert gynaecologists who have sub-specialised in reproductive medicine and are accredited as such by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The initial investigations may be undertaken in NHS clinics, using NHS notes which are not covered under this law, and treatment with surgery or drugs offered, completed and recorded as  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_248"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such. However, once the patient requires IVF, separate notes have to be set up and kept under lock and key&#151;for 50 years, as my noble friend has said&#151;away from other members of medical staff who are not licensed to see them.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07121269000040"></a>Any recording of information between those special notes and the routine notes where the remainder of the patient&#146;s initial assessment was recorded is forbidden without express consent. That is difficult to police effectively without significant additional bureaucracy. In reality, practitioners are in breach of those clauses every day. For example, if a gynaecologist receives a referral letter from a GP or a tertiary referral from a district general hospital clinician about a patient who has had unsuccessful IVF on two or three occasions at some centre in the UK or elsewhere with a request to perform a hysteroscopy to look into the uterus or a laparoscopy to look into the abdomen in order to see whether there is an obvious reason for failure, the gynaecologist would naturally record IVF procedures and any other relevant reproductive issues in the routine hospital notes in preparation for the intended surgery. However, if that gynaecologist works in an HFEA-licensed centre as a clinician, he or she would be in breach of the Act&#151;and liable to criminal prosecution for revealing the IVF information&#151;unless they had specifically requested written permission from a patient to record that information there. Should the gynaecologist not be a licensed individual, no such sanction applies. It cannot be right that the obligations specifically relate to the licensable status of the doctor, and it seems inappropriate that for one there is the usual restriction on confidentiality whereas for the other the threat of criminal sanction unique to this Act.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07121269000041"></a>Similarly, a male patient could be referred to an assisted conception centre because he has been found to have no sperm in his semen. In the licensed assisted conception unit, a biopsy of his testes is performed and indeed no sperm are found suitable for an IVF procedure. If that individual then went to see another gynaecologist or a urologist to discuss the options available, he and his partner&#146;s story would be recorded in the hospital notes during the consultation. This would be entirely legitimate, provided that that gynaecologist was not regarded as licensed under the Act, for which action he or she would be criminally liable unless they had sought specific permission to do so.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07121269000042"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to bring the HFE legislation more in line with standard rules on medical confidentiality. It will greatly streamline the way clinicians can deal with patients between hospital notes and restricted assisted conception unit notes and substantially reduce the regulatory burden applied by the HFEA. For years in my department my colleagues who are specialists in infertility and look after couples who require IVF had to whisper to me in the corridors, when they were successful in the woman conceiving, the name of the person who would then be attending my antenatal clinic. As I was not allowed to put that information on her notes, when she went into the labour ward no one knew that it was an IVF pregnancy; but we all knew because

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07121269000043"></a>On the effect of the amendments, new Section 33A(2)(i) provides an exception to the restriction on disclosure under the HFEA of information where the individuals to whom the information relates consent. The first amendment extends that exception so that individuals may consent to the disclosure of any information held about them under the HFEA. The second amendment introduces a further exception to the restriction on disclosure under the Act of information relating to individuals, permitting such disclosure for various medical purposes other than medical research, which is addressed by new Section 33C, where this is necessary or expedient in the interests of improving patient care or otherwise in the public interest.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07121269000044"></a>I am not seeking to widen anything; I am merely seeking that the confidentiality rules that apply to other aspects of medical care apply to couples who seek IVF&#151;not beyond that. As I have not mentioned embryo, SCNT or interspecies embryo, even my noble friend Lord Alton may be moved to support the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

However, one might wish to look at the wording in due course because it raises an issue of considerable practical clinical importance. I do not intend to speak for long. The current situation is hardly workable and can produce quite dangerous, if not bad, medicine.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07121269000046"></a>The other day, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, raised an important issue about in vitro fertilisation&#151;ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome, OHSS. When this occurs, women get very large, painful ovaries. If it is left untreated it can result in a quite serious condition and often requires hospital admission. Under the present legislation, if someone has had in vitro fertilisation in one hospital and then goes to another hospital with abdominal pain and ends up in casualty requiring admission, technically we are not allowed to tell that hospital about her treatment unless they have been registered with the HFEA. That, obviously, is a nonsense. At present, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said, in my unit at Hammersmith there are two totally separate sets of notes. Clinicians working in the hospital have no knowledge of a patient having in vitro fertilisation, which must be seen now as a routine treatment.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07121269000047"></a>There is one other issue that concerns me as a research worker. There is growing evidence that in the next decade we are going to understand much more about the complications of genetics. There is a growing focus on an area of genetics called epigenetics, which is where the DNA does not change but the way that the DNA function is capable of changing because of its environment. The environment at the beginning of development is extremely important. For example, we now know that very early environmental influences in the first few days of a mammal&#146;s life can radically alter its phenotype&#151;that is, how it becomes later on in life. The classic example was originally the low birth-weight  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_250"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 250</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>baby which, when it became 50 or 60, sometimes had a much higher risk of hypertension, heart disease, stroke and so on. But there almost certainly are much more subtle epigenetic effects than this in the human, though at the moment there are very few conditions that one can identify. There are one or two.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07121269000048"></a>There are specific things which are done to human embryos in culture which might produce unpredictable epigenetic effects. Those include embryo freezing. We have evidence in my own laboratory that when human embryos are frozen under certain routine circumstances, gene expression changes; that is, the genes change the protein that they produce, at least only temporarily. One of the genes that we have looked at protects against cancer. I am not suggesting an alarmist reaction to this work, but it was published in a very important peer review journal and was obviously acceptable to that journal. We have to say that there is a need for continuous follow-up for the sorts of thing that we do in in vitro fertilisation over a long period.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07121269000049"></a>Embryo freezing is by no means the only procedure that should be under surveillance. Prolonged culture&#151;where embryos are kept in culture for more than three days, up to five or six days&#151;is a growing trend in in vitro fertilisation at the moment. We know from work in mice that that also may produce anomalies of gene expression under certain circumstances. The third area I can think of immediately, though there are many others, is changes in the culture in which the embryo is produced.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07121269000050"></a>None of those should prevent us continuing to offer in vitro fertilisation. There is clearly no evidence of major abnormalities as a result of in vitro fertilisation &#151;at least in this country&#151;compared with people who had babies by the other method. When I say &#147;the other method&#148;, I remember my six year-old sitting at the breakfast table once saying to me, &#147;Dad, tell me, are more babies born by the test tube or by the other method?&#148;. In a family like mine it becomes a routine thing. I hope the Committee will forgive the digression.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07121269000051"></a>It is important that we recognise that it should be easier to survey children long-term, keeping proper records of those children if we can, in order to promote research rather than hinder or prevent it. One way of doing that is to avoid the unnecessary restrictions on confidentiality which do no good for the patient and which are now obsolete in terms of treatment. The routine issues of informed consent and the normal confidentiality that exist with virtually every other medical procedure should suffice for in vitro fertilisation as well.</p>

He is also right to tell us that there is no need for scaremongering or alarmism about this, but it is something about which we should take a long-term view. My noble friend will be pleased to know that I agree with him that the routine collection of this kind of data is crucially important as we understand what happens as a result of the use of in vitro fertilisation.

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07121269000053"></a>I have another question for him in this brief intervention concerning the issue of commercial exploitation. We all want to strike the right balance between providing information for the kind of creditable research that is needed and ensuring that there is no commercial exploitation of that kind of information in the future. If the noble Lord can give that assurance, many of us in the Committee will find the arguments that he has advanced very compelling.</p>

He and I have discussed this matter at some length over the past couple of days. I support him for two reasons. The one that I think is the most important was put to us by the British Fertility Society. Parents who have donor-assisted children and are going through the process of IVF do not object to the proposals the noble Lord is putting forward. They are somewhat surprised when they discover that all the treatment they would expect to go through in the course of a pregnancy will be hindered at various stages by the prevention of transmission of information, not for commercial purposes, not to outsiders, but to other practitioners, usually within the NHS.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07121269000055"></a>The most compelling argument is that the fact that a pregnancy has resulted from IVF makes a distinct difference to the tests that are carried out throughout a pregnancy. Adjustments have to be made to such things as amniocentesis tests and even the analysis of scans, because that is a relevant factor. Those are fairly compelling reasons for your Lordships to accept the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

New Clause 33C will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring or regulating the disclosure for research purposes of certain information held by the HFEA. Information could be disclosed for research where the Secretary of State considered it necessary or expedient in the public interest or in the interests of improving patient care. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill say that there is an expectation that the power will be used only in such circumstances where it would not be possible to obtain consent to the disclosure. This provision raises a number of questions and it would be helpful if the Minister could explain more fully what is intended.</p>

<a name="71212-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07121269000057"></a>My concern rests chiefly on the disclosure of personal information provided by patients in good faith, and which they have a right to expect will be kept confidential. As a normal rule, medical confidentiality should be sacrosanct unless there are overriding public health reasons to break that confidentiality. I am not sure that I see data held by the HFEA as a compelling candidate for disclosure. The words &#147;necessary or expedient&#148; ring alarm bells with me. The bells, I confess, ring all the louder if the provision is intended to apply retrospectively. People who have received IVF treatment

Unless retrospective consent is obtained from those individuals, I seriously question whether such disclosure can be justified. Is retrospective and non-consensual disclosure of the HFEA database being considered? I have no problem, of course, with anonymised data being released for research. It would be helpful to hear whether there is thought to be scope to do that or whether, in the nature of the research that is being contemplated, only named data will be of any real utility.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07121269000058"></a>My second main concern relates to the kinds of reason that Ministers may regard as strong enough for them to exercise the power given to them by the new clause. I can well see that there may be some public benefit in establishing, for example, the long-term health outcomes of children conceived by IVF. However, if the database is to be released to researchers, their reason for accessing it has to be because the findings that might be expected to emerge from an analysis of it are of major public importance. Merely to conduct a fishing expedition would not, I think, constitute a sufficiently good reason.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07121269000059"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me that, if consent is given, data would be released to researchers on a restricted, need-to-know basis. The HFEA is a widely respected organisation, but I hope it is not unfair to say that, for some, it is a little faceless and impersonal. At times, it can give the impression of behaving like a Star Chamber in its decision-making. It is important that, if these provisions are agreed to, the HFEA takes account of the need to explain to the public why it is releasing data, why doing so does not represent an unacceptable breach of trust, and what they see as the likely benefits of disclosure.</p>

Let me first address the two amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel. The first, Amendment No. 64A, relates to disclosure of identifiable information held on the HFEA register with consent. The second, Amendment No. 64B, relates to disclosure of information without consent.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07121269000066"></a>During the public consultation on the Bill, the view was expressed that the additional level of protection applied to identifying information about treatments and other activities regulated by the 1990 Act was unnecessary, that it hindered the legitimate exchange of information and that the protection provided by the Data Protection Act 1998 and the common law on confidentiality, which regulate disclosure of information from most other health records, would provide sufficient safeguards for patients, gamete and embryo donors, and offspring.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07121269000067"></a>In my clinical practice, I am well used to working within these controls, so I can appreciate why that view is held. It is certainly shared by the noble Lord, whose amendments would relax the prohibition on disclosure of identifying information with, in the case of Amendment No. 64B, the practical effect of leaving identifying information essentially subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act and the common law. However, in setting the level of protection for identifying information covered by the 1990 Act and this Bill, the Government are obliged to have regard to the requirements of a European Union directive that sets standards of quality and safety in relation to human tissues, including gametes and embryos, intended for human application.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07121269000068"></a>The Government are of the view that Article 14 of the directive, which sets the requirements on data protection and confidentiality for health records, requires statutory protection that goes further than that which the Data Protection Act and the common law provide. This is due to the fact that it involves the use of a person&#146;s tissue for someone else. We consider that this level of protection is achieved by the prohibition on disclosure in new Section 33A.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_254"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71212-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07121269000069"></a>We have, however, added some new exceptions in new Section 33A that will ensure that disclosure for legitimate purposes, such as patient care or the investigation of a potential offence, is not inappropriately impeded. Moreover, the power in the 1990 Act to make regulations adding further exceptions to the prohibition is still included in the Bill, in new Section 33B. Therefore, if it becomes evident that there are further circumstances in which disclosure legitimately needs to be made, it will be possible to make regulations to allow for this.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07121269000070"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s Amendment No. 64A would allow disclosure of identifying information with the consent of the persons to whom the information relates. However, it could also permit disclosure of information to those who were conceived using donated gametes or a donated embryo. The exceptions relating to donors and those born as a consequence of donation apply in a different way from those that relate to people who have received treatment services. In particular, identifying information about donors cannot be released to those conceived using their donation until the donor-conceived person reaches 18 and chooses to find out the donor&#146;s identity. Separate provisions for donor information are necessary to prevent information being disclosed to a donor-conceived person outside the system provided for in the new sections inserted by Clause 24. The amendment could lead to a donor-conceived person, possibly a young teenager, obtaining identifying information about their donor outside the system provided for in new Section 31ZA. I imagine that that is not what the noble Lord was seeking.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07121269000071"></a>With regard to information about those who have received treatment services, the aim of the amendment is already achieved by the exception in new Section 33A(2)(h). This, together with the exceptions allowing wider disclosure by the HFEA, HFEA-licensed establishments and others to whom the prohibition in the 1990 Act applies, will allow the type of disclosure that the noble Lord seeks.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07121269000072"></a>New Section 33A strikes an appropriate balance between the obligation to protect the confidentiality of patients, children and donors, and ensuring that information can be disclosed where it is necessary.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07121269000073"></a>I turn to the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. A key recommendation of the 1984 Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology, chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, was the creation of a register of assisted conception treatments that would allow the long-term health implications for children born as a result of those treatments to be monitored. Since August 1991, the HFEA register has kept a record of every IVF and donor insemination treatment cycle carried out by licensed clinics in the UK, including, where known, its outcome. The HFEA register represents one of the most comprehensive stores of information on these treatments in the world. For that reason the Government intend to ensure that the Bill will pave the way to enabling better use to be made of this valuable resource, to improve our knowledge about these treatments.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07121269000074"></a>We will remove the barrier in the 1990 Act that prevents patients giving their consent to the disclosure of identifying information from the HFEA register. Patients will have the opportunity and the choice, on

However, this is a solution only for future treatments. We also need to find a way to ensure that the wealth of information collected over the past 17 years can also be used to benefit research. To ensure that this can happen, the Government propose the affirmative regulation-making power in new Section 33C, with a view to enabling researchers to request identifying information from the HFEA register, licensed clinics and providers of non-medical fertility services, where it is not reasonably practical to obtain the consent of the persons to whom the information relates.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07121269000075"></a>I assure the noble Earl that before such regulations are introduced, it is appropriate that a full consultation takes place. Following this, the proposed model for releasing the information for research will be included in regulations, which will be debated in both Houses.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07121269000076"></a>We intend that it will be possible to disclose identifying information under the regulations only where the research is necessary in the public interest, or, in the cases of medical research, in the interests of improving patient care. As the data on the HFEA register and records held in licensed clinics go back to 1991, it may no longer be practical to obtain consent to disclosure from persons to whom the information relates. Without the authorisation process, which this clause enables the Secretary of State to put in place, using regulation, it is likely that the data from a large number of records would be barred from use in research, thereby limiting the benefits that could be derived from this information.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07121269000077"></a>A practical outcome of such a restriction might be that researchers could not be given a complete set of data on patients who have undergone a specific type of fertility treatment, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, and so might not be able to assess fully whether this treatment has any link with the development of particular genetic conditions in some of the resulting children. Similarly, researchers hoping to link HFEA data with information held in other health registries, such as a local cancer registry, would not be able to have a complete data set, again limiting their ability to determine whether there is any indication of a link between a certain type of fertility treatment or process and the onset of a particular medical condition.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07121269000078"></a>Regulation-making power of the type proposed in new Section 33C is not new. A similar authorisation procedure already exists in England and Wales for the NHS or privately funded healthcare systems. A system where an application made to the Secretary of State for access to confidential patient information, without consent, was established under the regulations made under Section 251 of the National Health Service Act 2006. The patient information advisory group advises the Secretary of State on the appropriateness of approving applications for the disclosure of information under those regulations. Section 33C(2) includes powers to establish one or more bodies to consider applications for access to identifying information from the HFEA register and from health records held by licensed establishments. The process established by the regulations will need to work equally in all four home countries.

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07121269000079"></a>Clinical and scientific professionals have long regarded the audit of clinical practice and studies into the long-term results of medical treatments to be one of the most important parts of healthcare service and vital if we are properly to serve the interests of our patients and the wider public. Treatments such as IVF are widely considered to be safe for both patients and offspring, but I believe we would be failing those patients and children if we did not take every opportunity to ensure that long-term follow-up studies can take place to confirm that view.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07121269000080"></a>The authorisation process allowed for in this clause is intended to provide a method of last resort. It cannot be used by researchers to circumvent the need to seek patients&#146; consent, where it is reasonably practical to consult them. New Section 33C(5) sets the obligation that the regulations may not enable or require identifying information to be disclosed or processed for any purpose, if it would be reasonably practical to achieve the purpose by other means. I hope that will reassure the noble Lord and he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

My intention is to bring the information of those seeking IVF treatment in line with other medical confidentiality regulations for their better care. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="71212-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07121281000011"></a>The noble Lord said: In what I know the whole House hope will be the temporary absence of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, for reasons of which we are all aware, I am moving the amendment standing in his name. As Members of the Committee know, the amendments propose the creation of a national human bioethics commission&#151;a proposal for which the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, argued with his customary eloquence at Second Reading. He has argued and canvassed widely for the proposal over an extensive period. I can do no better than refer the Committee to the memorandum submitted by the noble Lord to the Joint Committee, which appears on page 271 of its report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07121281000037"></a>&#147;This proposal suggests the formation of a National Bioethics Council for the UK, to be given statutory foundation in the proposed Human Tissue and Embryos Act. Such a body would have a diverse membership on terms laid down in statute, would be supported by public money and would be separate and independent from particular government departments and agencies, having no regulatory, administrative or quasi-legislative functions. Its purpose would be enhance the democratic process by providing the material to support better informed public debate, so that decisions on contentious matters in the life sciences would be supported by an informed public view and could be taken in a more democratic and inclusive fashion than they are at present&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121281000031"></a>I was also struck by the penultimate and concluding paragraphs&#151;paragraphs 48 and 49&#151;in his memorandum, which state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07121281000038"></a>&#147;Overall, such a body would foster informed public and legislative debate on critical new issues in the life sciences, building consensus where possible and increasing the democratic legitimacy of decisions that cannot be universally popular ... In the UK, it was only in the latter part of the 20th Century that serious attention was given to bioethics, albeit in the disparate fashion criticised above. In the 21st Century it is certain that the life sciences will create issues of regular and profound public interest with increasing rapidity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121281000032"></a>Those words seem almost prophetic in the context of our debates in the preceding three days of Committee and today. I am grateful to Dr Brian Iddon, a Labour Member of another place, who reminded me yesterday of the decision taken in recommendation 85 of the 2005 Science and Technology Committee report to,</p>
<ul><a name="07121281000039"></a>&#147;recommend the formation of a single commission to develop policy issues relating to the assisted reproduction, embryo research and human genetics&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71212-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07121281000012"></a>The argument has been widely canvassed, and the Committee is well aware of it. However, I shall try to summarise the core arguments for the creation of such a national bioethics commission. In Britain, as in other societies, we find ourselves in a situation in which those who make policy, who implement it and

There are enormous opportunities for good&#151;we have heard some during the Committee&#146;s deliberations&#151;but also risks and threats to individual and social well-being.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07121281000013"></a>In recent decades, we have become increasingly aware of the ethical dimensions of policy and practice. It is not enough to ask about what has been done in the past or what could be done in the future. We also need to address the question of what should be done. That is in part a matter of prudence, effectiveness and efficiency, but it also has an important and ineliminable ethical aspect. Ethics comprises the identification of values and principles, but also surely the determination of their appropriate application in particular fields and cases. That is no easy matter, particularly given the diversity of moral, social and religious perspectives that characterises contemporary society. At the same time, however, there is widespread agreement on the importance of ethics. Among those who reflect on such matters, there is general agreement about the centrality of such values as welfare, autonomy and respect, and growing recognition that they cannot be reduced to a single value but must be maintained in some kind of balance. I was struck in our preceding debate by how my noble friend Lord Patel and the noble Lord, Lord Winston, were arguing, understandably, for the use of information to develop research to ensure good medical practice. Of course, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, made an equally valid point about the protection of the individual. It is important to get the balance between the conflicting questions right.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07121281000014"></a>Bioethics brings together philosophy, science, medicine and healthcare but increasingly recognises the need to have regard to broad social interests, as well as the needs and concerns of specialist groups. The problems are pressing, the concerns widespread and the issues difficult, but resources can be brought to bear to provide policy-makers such as ourselves and others with information, advice and guidance. Hitherto individuals, organisations and institutions have directed their attention to bioethical issues, but surely it is time to establish a national resource, responsive to UK needs and, though independent of government, responsible to the nation through Parliament.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07121281000015"></a>Bioethics is well developed among academics, and for some years has featured in medical and healthcare education. Patient and other service-user groups are also increasingly aware of the ethical aspect of their interest. In addition, religious faiths, denominations and other value-based communities and organisations have focused attention on bioethical issues generally in response to the developing or prospective practices in which they have particular interests or concerns.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07121281000016"></a>Out of this background have emerged a number of academic journals, societies and research groups, usually university-based, as well as a growing cluster of voluntary organisations, large and small. Publications such as the <I>Journal of Medical Ethics</I><I>,</I> or bodies such as the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, represent highly professional standards of research and dissemination, and good work has also been done by small but

Other groupings, such as Progress Educational Trust represent opposing ethical positions, and this diversity of independent parties has contributed much to the extent and level of current debates, in particular by drawing issues to the attention of the public and of politicians alike. I believe that is extremely healthy.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07121281000017"></a>In other parts of the world, it has come to be recognised that the scale, importance and difficulty of bioethical issues calls for the establishment of national committees within which these can be analysed, reviewed and debated with the purpose of informing society and policy-makers. In March 2005, the European Conference of National Ethics Committees known as COMETH, produced a report on the functioning of the 42 national committees which comprise its membership. As this figure indicates, COMETH membership includes more than one committee from each European nation. They range from self-created voluntary associations to standing committees established by statute. There are two United Kingdom members: the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07121281000018"></a>In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and other countries, Governments or Ministers have established national bioethics committees. The constitutions, remits, operation and achievements of those bodies are relevant to the establishment and responsibilities of a United Kingdom national bioethics committee. The Danish and German models are widely admired, but several others also have good features.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07121281000019"></a>The idea of a United Kingdom national bioethics committee has arisen in the past, but in recent times it has re-emerged with greater urgency and definition in response to the growing number of difficult issues and decisions. One focus of these has been the review by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee of the operations of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act and of the HFEA. In the course of that review, members of the committee and witnesses to it spoke favourably of the idea of a national bioethics committee, and in the same period Professor John Haldane, Director of the Centre for Ethics, Philosophy and Public Affairs at the University of St Andrews, the leading UK philosophy and policy centre&#151;I declare a nonpecunary interest as a visiting fellow&#151;has pressed the case in several contexts, as my noble friend Lord Patel is well aware, including in letters to the <I>Times</I> and the <I>Telegraph</I>. Calls for the establishment by the Government of a United Kingdom national bioethics committee have also been made by the Archbishop of Westminster and by the Chief Rabbi, Dr Sir Jonathan Sacks.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07121281000020"></a>Such a committee would have the authority and standing of an independent statutory body. Its membership should encompass relevant professional expertise, patients and other user-group interests, as well as major religious and ethical groupings. Membership must reflect the diversity of positions within society, and appointment procedures must be public and transparent. Although independent, such a committee  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_261"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be responsible to Parliament through a Minister to whom it should deliver an annual report, including recommendations for policy and such additional reports as may be commissioned or submitted. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, has canvassed the idea, to which I hope she will refer during the proceedings in Committee, that this body will also monitor legislation and be able to evaluate its effectiveness. Its remit would be the entire range of bioethical issues, including, but not confined to those concerning reproduction.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07121281000021"></a>Amendments Nos. 66 and 67 seek to establish such a body. Some have argued for a new in-house Westminster committee. It is open to the authorities in both Houses to produce a body if they feel that that would enhance the work of the existing Select Committees. Those two ideas are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they could complement one another very well. That is not a legislative issue. A national bioethics committee is, and that is why the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, drafted these amendments. We all eagerly await the return of the noble Lord to his usual place from where he will, with his customary and characteristic persuasiveness, be able to argue for such a body at Report and offer us many more insights and arguments than I have been able to do today. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="07121281000022"></a><b><a name="71212-0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121281000042"></a>Lord Turnberg:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Alton, makes an extremely good case for a forum at which the many and varied ethical issues that we face in Parliament and in the public can be examined in great depth. It could take evidence and advice from a wide background of sources and produce well-informed and well-researched reports which set out the pros and cons of the issues. That is what came out of the report by the Select Committee on Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill, which was chaired so wonderfully by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. It was an excellent example and extremely valuable to this House. I am very supportive of the principle, if not the specific type of committee which is being proposed. As the noble Lord mentioned, we have the excellent Nuffield Council on Bioethics which produces valuable, informed and authoritative reports. They do not necessarily cover all the areas that we might need or want but it produces very good reports. We also have a tried and tested in-house mechanism which does not require a completely new and expensive bureaucracy&#151;the Select Committee structure. A new standing all-party Select Committee of both Houses&#151;or perhaps just the House of Lords&#151;could be set up to examine specific ethical issues, to take all the evidence it needs and to produce reports which would be debated in Parliament. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Alton, will think about this possibility and I also hope the Minister will take it on board.</p>

About 10 years ago, when Dolly the sheep was born and cloning and stem cells began to

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07121281000024"></a>I support the notion of the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, that Parliament should have a Select Committee because Parliament governs this field&#151;the legislation passed by this House and the other place. The countries listed by my noble friend Lord Alton which have ethics committees are all either deeply religious or totally unregulated, or both. In my experience, the further south and east you go in Europe, the more these committees are dominated by religious people&#151;not that there is anything bad in that, but they can be used to hold back the progress of the law. In the USA, the bioethics commission, it has been alleged, is filled with people who support the President&#146;s view, whoever is the president of the day. Its reports have regularly been ignored and they have been forward-looking. Parliament is ultimately the ethical regulator. This is a country governed by law and that takes me to my final argument, which is that not much can be achieved by a bioethics commission. </p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07121281000025"></a>I speak from my experience chairing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which is a working office that is open every day. It was always on a Friday afternoon that a parent or a clinician would call. I remember one particular Friday afternoon a surgeon called saying that he had a little boy patient, aged about two, who had leukaemia. The treatment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was going to start on Monday and it seemed very likely that it would destroy the little boy&#146;s future fertility. The surgeon had had a bright idea. He wished to remove a small slice of the toddler&#146;s testicular tissue while it was undamaged, freeze it, and, maybe in 17 or 20 years&#146; time, when the boy had, it was hoped, recovered, reinsert the tissue in the hope that healthy sperm would grow. &#147;Can you please&#148;, the surgeon said, &#147;give permission for this on the spot because chemotherapy is going to start on Monday?&#148;. In a situation like that, you cannot say, &#147;This is extremely interesting and novel. We would like to refer it to the National Human Bioethics Commission, which will issue a report in several years&#146; time and be placed before Parliament&#148;, and so on. It is the law that governs and it has to provide an answer in those situations. I am happy to say that the answer provided by the law was, &#147;Yes&#148;.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07121281000026"></a>The phone rang on another Friday afternoon, and the question from a hospital was, &#147;We have removed the sperm of a dead man. Can we keep it?&#148;. Again, you have to give an answer that is within the law, as best you can. While a human bioethics commission may do no harm, if it is not used as tool by those who might want to hold back progress&#151;which is possible&#151;I am not sure how much short-term good it can do by comparison with the committees we already have. The choice of members would be extremely problematic and it would demand very skilful chairing. As we are on our fourth day in Committee on this Bill, I need hardly point out to your Lordships that the more experts you have on this topic, the more opinions there are. In the end, by negotiation through Parliament, these things have to be decided within a legal framework.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07121281000027"></a>So I would conclude: probably no harm, but possibly; although I am afraid it would not be much good, remembering that it is always happens on Friday afternoon.</p>

What has troubled me about our debates during the past four days is that we have heard from three extremely expert clinicians about the advantages of the proposals. I accept those advantages, but I do not think that we have heard practically anything about the possible risks. The risks may be more hypothetical than the advantages, but there should be someone who sits down and thinks about the risks that might arise from the processes that we are legitimising. I am not holding back progress, as my noble friend suggested. It is a question of whether progress is wise and whether it is, in fact, being made in the right direction. I do not know if this bioethics commission would have that function of looking at the long-term picture, but if it would, I would be in favour of it.</p>

I read in the paper only the other day&#151;and I do not think it has been mentioned in this Committee&#151;that an organisation in California collects and stores the sperm of famous people and sells it for hundreds of thousands of pounds per dose. This is a kind of abuse&#151;and there may be many others. What I am saying is that I do not know the abuses; no one has told me what the abuses might be. That is the weakness in the debate we have been having.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07121291000002"></a>I shall comment briefly on the amendment. Many of the suggestions made by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, are extremely sensible and are certainly worthy of full discussion. However, I cannot help wondering whether a national bioethics committee of the kind that he envisages would carry far wider issues than the rather narrow issues that we are discussing in this Bill. A much more important matter that has come before this House repeatedly is death and euthanasia. That seems to me to be far more serious in many ways. Therefore, one cannot help wondering whether this matter is deserving of completely separate legislation and more thorough discussion than may be possible within the context of a Bill on in vitro fertilisation and reproductive medicine.</p>

It seems to me that there is an important gap in the present structure which a committee of this kind&#151;possibly a parliamentary committee&#151;would fill very successfully.

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07121291000004"></a>Members of the Committee will know that when we come to discuss an issue in a Bill which is concerned with scientific material, we often talk in terms of hypotheses&#151;for example, about the effect of embryonic stem cell research versus adult stem cell research. They are hypotheses of the kind that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, mentioned a few moments ago with regard to the impact of long-term freezing on embryos, and other hypotheses relate to other areas of science. That is often the way in which we necessarily discuss many issues because the question of how particular proposals will work out lies in the future. By definition, that must be the case when we consider advanced research on the horizon of scientific knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07121291000005"></a>I am concerned that in this House we almost never assess the impact of what we decide to go ahead with, and that applies not only to scientific Bills but Bills in general. We make decisions on the basis of the best information that we can get and the best projections that people can make, but necessarily we do not know what the effects will be, and I am struck by how rarely we look later at what they are. I repeat that that is not only true of Bills with a scientific element. As an example, back in 2001, I believed that there was huge potential in adult stem cells, but at that time that view was largely dismissed. It is not enough for me or anyone else simply to assert that embryonic stem cells provide a more effective form of research than adult stem cells; we need to know over time which of the two&#151;or perhaps it will be both&#151;prove to be effective forms of therapy and research. In other words, I want to know more than I do at the point at which I take part in a debate.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07121291000006"></a>One thing that could effectively be done by the kind of bioethics commission that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, talked about and to which the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, referred would be to see precisely how far the predictions that we make in our debates, and which are embodied in Bills that become Acts of Parliament, are borne out by subsequent evidence. I use the word &#147;evidence&#148; advisedly because I believe that we need to rely heavily on facts and not simply on an exchange of opinion. I should like to see a committee&#151;such as the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, gave evidence on to the Joint Committee but which, by the nature of things, he has not been able to speak to again on this occasion&#151;pursuing the statements made in this debate to find out how far they are borne out by the findings of research over the subsequent few years. We would all be able to base our conclusions and our witness on much sounder ground if we knew that that follow-up would take place. That is exactly the purpose for which I should like to see such a committee established.</p>

Issues that are not exactly part of our debate today have the greatest ethical consequences&#151;for example, mixing artificial intelligence with the building of a robot so as to create an artificially intelligent machine, which raises questions about where a human being&#146;s intelligence begins and ends and the extent to which a machine&#146;s intelligence determines whether it is or is not human. There are issues in all areas where the movement of research, development and findings is so fast that it is almost impossible to keep pace.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07121291000008"></a>I hope that we might look more closely at this proposal in terms of following through the research being done to see how far it establishes the hypotheses we have been discussing. Such a committee should have the duty of reporting to Parliament on the discoveries made, how those have affected legislation that we have already passed and how they ought to guide legislation that we propose in future. The wider approach of countries such as Denmark and France&#151;which is not exactly a unitary religious country&#151;has great advantages because it raises issues on a much wider plane than we have done so far in the United Kingdom. That plane goes beyond the life sciences. I hope that we can consider this issue further and consider how we can keep pace with the blinding speed at which science is advancing, while at the same time not only learning from what we have already done in legislation but seeing how we should create and advance legislation in future.</p>

I think she said that the views of people who supported work on adult stem cells were dismissed. With due respect, I do not think that that is true. They were taken very seriously in this House and on the Select Committee that I had the privilege of chairing. Everybody recognises that a great deal of valuable work was done; the question at issue was whether it should be the only form of research permitted. Research papers on adult stem cell work and embryonic stem cell work are being published the whole time. There is no reason why the Science and Technology Committee should not ask for a report at any stage, although we have to remember that this work is going on year after year and there may not be significant results for several years in the areas in which we most hope for results.</p>

First, it is envisaged that the national human bioethics commission would report to Parliament. It would be very important, sooner rather than later, to explore the respective roles and responsibilities of other bodies that also have a keen interest in this area, notably the Human Genetics Commission, which has already been mentioned; the HFEA; and the Science and Technology Committee, which has strong ethical views. Not every member of the latter body has the same ethical views but its members would certainly want to rebut any idea that they were only interested in science and technology. It would be important to explore the roles and responsibilities of these different bodies, otherwise it could all get into a great muddle.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07121291000012"></a>Secondly, what more would this national human bioethics commission add to the work already being done? For example, the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, mentioned the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. To begin with, that council is financed independently of government by a combination of grants from the Nuffield Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. That in itself is a significant advantage. Also, appointments to the Nuffield council are made in the usual manner for public appointments, with advertisements in all the major newspapers and interviews and the usual appointments procedures being applied.</p>

<a name="71212-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07121291000013"></a>Members of the Nuffield council are unpaid, and I notice that, according to the proposed new schedule, members of the national human bioethics committee would be remunerated for their work. The Nuffield council has a wide range of expertise, from scientific and philosophical to ethical. Here I must declare an interest, which I am afraid I do rather reluctantly. This will not raise the estimate by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, of the Nuffield council, but I declare that I am a member of it. However, it would be a help if your Lordships could discount that fact and look at the other members.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07121291000014"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, said, the reports produced by the Nuffield council are highly prestigious and authoritative and widely read. Some of our reports get something like 50,000 or 60,000 hits when we put them on to the web; they are also taken seriously by government. There is no fear of addressing controversial issues. Recent reports have, for example, been on neonates and on the use of animals, which brings out another fact&#151;that members of the Nuffield council working parties who produce these reports are not necessarily all of the same view. For example, the group that produced the report on the testing of animals had at least one member who was totally opposed to the use of any animal in testing. The Nuffield council tries to take other views on board and meets very regularly with the national bioethics committees of France and Germany on a bilateral and sometimes trilateral basis.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07121291000015"></a>I must emphasise that I am not opposed to exploring as seriously as possible the idea of a national human bioethics commission. However, we first need to ask what its roles and responsibilities would be in relation to other bodies. Perhaps even more significantly, what would it add to the work that the Nuffield council, financed independently of government, is already doing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07121291000016"></a>The kind of commission that we might want to examine issues, if not on a permanent basis then at least occasionally, is the kind of parliamentary Select Committee, already mentioned, that was chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. Such a committee can produce the kind of reports that would be welcomed by this House and the House of Commons. Because they come from its own midst, Parliament takes such reports with particular seriousness.</p>

I noted, too, the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. I shall come back to what she said in a moment.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_268"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07121291000022"></a>Let me take up the point that the noble Baroness made in her telling remarks about the pressures of Friday afternoons. It struck me&#151;as it has struck me in the past when I have read about Friday afternoon decisions in the press&#151;that because necessary and humane decisions are, as she suggested, made under considerable pressure on Friday afternoons or over the weekend, those decisions will go on to gain strong status as precedents in the weeks, months and years to come. The question then arises of whether a body such as the one proposed in the amendment is necessary because of the potential difficulties, if not the dangers, of Friday afternoon decisions. The material perhaps could go to the Nuffield council.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07121291000023"></a>My reason for aligning myself with the proposal is this. Both in what I have been privileged to be present for in the process of the Bill so far, and in the rest of its process which I have carefully read, a small number of remarks have been strengthened in my mind by what I have read of the activities in recent months of one parliamentary committee in particular. This has raised considerable questions in my mind which the amendment seems to pick up. I do not want to suggest or to be heard saying, because it is not what I want to say, that any noble Lords with a particular clinical or research brilliance and experience are not serious about ethical considerations&#151;they clearly are and have expressed that awareness&#151;but there has been in my reading and hearing a subordinate thread running through which has asked at particular points, but also once or twice as a generalisation, for regulation that is less rather than more stringent and lighter rather than heavier.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07121291000024"></a>More seriously, that raises the question which has been raised in the process of this Bill of the status of ethical questions&#151;and indeed of ethical questions out of Christian and other religious frameworks&#151;in relation to the status of the actual, experienced, potential or perceived needs of patients and of the needs, responsibilities, intelligence and energies of clinicians and researchers, either in the present time or in years to come.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07121291000025"></a>This proposal is of fundamental importance. I declare an interest in relation to paragraph 1(4)(c) of the proposed new schedule. Were these amendments to be carried, or in considering alternatives to them, it is extremely important that the content if not the wording of sub-paragraph (4)(c) should appear crystal clearly on the face of the Bill as an equal participant and not, as it has appeared occasionally in the past months, and not only in the passage of the Bill so far, as a kind of poor or suffered relation. That is very important not only in this society, with its particular intellectual, political and legal history, but at this time&#151;when, to many people&#146;s surprise, there is a fresh bubbling-up of a whole range of religious, non-religious and philosophical/ethical questions.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07121291000026"></a>I shall give two examples. I remember from my reading the striking speech made on Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, and the frequency with which noble Lords have aligned themselves with a range of others raising specifically ethical questions while disclaiming that they are led to do so from any religious tradition. That leads me to think how important this matter is&#151;so important that I was

I discovered that consultants think very hard about the ethics of what they do, and that they listen hard to theologians and philosophers because they know that society has to be behind them when they do these things, otherwise they will have to stop doing them. In a practical way I have learnt not to fail to listen to the noble Lords who are consultants as well as to the theologians and philosophers.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07121291000029"></a>The reason for wanting such a committee is an important one. I, too, have felt throughout my years in this House when we have been legislating that perhaps we have not listened carefully enough or at sufficient leisure to the various arguments for and against what was being suggested and the issues underlying them. The question is: how do you achieve that? Frankly, the fact that the theologians, philosophers and ethics experts who are going to meet will be appointed by the Secretary of State slightly spoils the suggestion. There might be a better argument for this committee if the House of Lords were elected, by the way. I am quite sure that we could not have this discussion if we were elected.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07121291000030"></a>When we are discussing legislation in the House of Lords, the problem is always politics. It is when the politics comes in that we often spoil the deep quality of a proposal. That is natural. All of us in this House understand a good deal about politics just from seeing what happens in here. I learnt about it in local government in Dundee, and it helped me very much when I was chairing the research ethics committee to know how politics worked. However, if what is proposed could be done outside Parliament, that would be much better. I do not know enough about the Nuffield Council to know about its quality, but I suspect it is probably well equipped to do that.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07121291000031"></a>I am in favour of such discussion happening and being taken seriously in Parliament, but I do not feel that this is the best way of doing it. I say so to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who himself knows politics very well, and probably understands what I am saying even if he disagrees with me. In moving his amendment he is making an important point about politics, but I am not sure he has the best idea for achieving depth in what we do in Parliament on these difficult issues.</p>

I am not sure I follow her so generally on the path of her political observations, but what she had to say was very helpful. In listening to the Committee today, I find that there is wide agreement that people would like to see a broad ethical context for some of the discussions we have on these very important issues.

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07121291000033"></a>I was rather surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, spoke about the need for such a committee retrospectively to assess legislation&#151;I think I am right in taking her point in that way&#151;because presumably that would be only if it were a parliamentary committee, which is what I would personally support. That could be a legitimate role in government. The commission suggested in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, would not have any value in that respect.

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07121291000034"></a>I support the points that were well made by the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries. My feeling about this issue was informed by the report of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, which, as we know, was done by the authoritative and representative body of Members of both Houses. They specifically said, after dealing with a great deal of evidence on this in paragraph 48:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07121291000136"></a>&#147;We are unable to support proposals for a national bioethics committee. Ultimately it must be for Parliament to set the ethical framework, taking the widest range of advice. We consider that an ethical input should be found from within Parliament and we recommend that Parliament should establish a joint bioethics committee of both Houses to provide ethical input to legislation raising significant issues in bioethics, such as the current draft Bill.&#148;</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07121291000035"></a>That would be the appropriate way forward and would enable some of the broader points raised by, for example, the noble Lord, Lord Winston, about other issues to be considered.</p>

I have listened to the debate and it struck me that there might be a degree of confusion. The law is asked to give absolute answers, yes or no. Indeed research ethics committees are asked either to approve or reject applications before them. However, one difficulty with ethics is encapsulated in Professor Raanan Gillon&#146;s concept of scope and the broader implications of decisions that are made.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07121291000037"></a>I would certainly echo some of the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby. Legislation goes through that might not need to be examined. The Human Tissue Act comes to mind. There is increasing evidence that samples are not being taken quite so often to review the accuracy of diagnoses. That might have an ongoing effect on how much clinicians audit the accuracy of their diagnoses, with a fall-off in post-mortems and examinations.</p>

I do not see this proposal as in any way undermining existing committees. However, there may be, as evidenced in this debate, a gap that needs to be plugged.

It would also have to have the ability to put a fair degree of pressure on research funding councils to ensure that research in areas perhaps a little lower down the priority list was funded so that unanswered questions around the effect and scope of decisions that had been made were explored.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07121291000040"></a>One difficulty for philosophers and ethicists is that they can debate and weigh up issues eternally but often not get to a so-called right or wrong decision whereas decisions in law and in morality are either right or wrong. Many things happen that may be ethical but not legal or legal but, based on the individual situation, not ethical. That broader look might be called for. Therefore, there is much to commend what is before us. I would not say that it is perfect but I would be worried if we simply dismissed this proposal out of hand.</p>

For example, it might not be big enough, bearing in mind what is proposed in Amendment No. 67.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07121291000042"></a>However, I will make two general points in response to the debate. First, noble Lords have asked why we need this commission in the first place. We need it because it would send out the signal that the Government take ethical issues seriously, a signal that they should send out. For many years, ethics has been considered as a field quite properly for experts and sometimes for campaigners and committee rooms&#151;in many ways rather like the environment was considered 25 or 30 years ago, with a few campaigning groups and some experts talking about the environment. In the next few decades, these ethical issues will roar up the political agenda as the general population becomes aware of their implications and that which was a matter for the few&#151;the well intentioned and expert few whom I admire&#151;will become something for the population as a whole.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07121291000043"></a>My second point relates to issues that were raised earlier. I was approached by someone outside the Chamber, who very kindly and politely said, &#147;Why are you such a plodder on these issues? Don&#146;t you appreciate that science is terribly exciting and interesting and it&#146;s moving very fast indeed? We can&#146;t sit around waiting for some commission made up of ethicists and philosophers to let us know whether we can go on with these exciting things&#148;. That almost makes the case for this commission. One could almost sit down, although I assure your Lordships that I am  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not about to sit down on this point. Much as we need a forum for ethical issues at a national level, which is being promoted by this agenda, we also need to be cautious about speed and the seductive idea that things are moving so fast that, even on a Friday afternoon, decisions have to be taken quickly. Friday afternoon decisions are sometimes very dangerous, just like the products made on a Friday afternoon at the old British Leyland plant at Cowley, outside Oxford, were found to be dangerous. One does not have to be driven, in the face of demands on Friday afternoons, to take decisions within the framework of the law, as interpreted by experts on that Friday afternoon. This debate has been helpful in teasing out those issues.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07121291000044"></a>In my concluding remarks, I shall concentrate on the commission and how it might be made up. I shall refer to the sorts of people I would not wish to see in a predominant position on the commission, those I would like to see represented in a broadly-based membership and, most importantly, that saintly person who might be picked to chair the commission. First, I would not like to see big pharmaceutical companies getting in and being in a dominant position to influence the commission, or biotech, medical, venturing industries getting an unnatural hold on the commission, important though they are. Nor would I like to see anything approaching a clear majority of doctors, scientists and technicians&#151;to borrow the excellent phrase used a little while ago by my noble friend Lord Tebbit&#151;and those in related fields, who might benefit, albeit inadvertently, from the commission&#146;s decisions, via everything from professional advancement through to profit from findings, product development, publication, media appearances and the rest.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07121291000045"></a>On the other hand, I should like to see a balanced membership&#151;I stress the word balanced&#151;drawn from exactly that category of first-class researchers in the field, who are doctors, geneticists, biologists and others. There should certainly be a strong representation of ethicists and philosophers. I have long believed that every government department would benefit from having one or more philosophers on its staff to sit on the shoulders of the Secretary of State of the day. It is a pity that we do not have such appointments. Certainly, a representative or so from the faith groups&#151;I use that term as shorthand to embrace those who might belong to secular, rather than religious, society and feel strongly in that direction. There is also probably a need for a competent statistician.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07121291000046"></a>Thirdly, the commission would need to be chaired by a woman or a man who is above the fray of debate, whose views are as neutral as possible and who is not passionately in favour of anything or indeed passionately against certain things&#151;that, much as I would like to get my hands on the chairmanship, undoubtedly rules me out. I have in mind the kind of figure whom we seek to chair a body such as the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#151;someone who is passionate only about being dispassionate in the interests of the ethical issues that are raised and brought to such a commission.</p>

If the proposed committee is intended above all to be neutral and non-political, which is the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, powerfully made, the Nuffield committee fulfils those criteria well, because it is independently funded. The one thing in its favour, which my noble and right reverend friend did not mention, is its success in carrying out surveys over a wide field. On some of the most important issues that it has discussed, it has carried out surveys which have brought in the opinions of many members of the public. I think my noble and right reverend friend would agree that they have been successfully taken into account.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07121291000048"></a>To replicate the work of that committee would be wasteful, expensive and, in my experience of general ethics committees, probably counterproductive. The only committee of which I have been a member was set up by European Commission to look widely at bioethics and was an absolute disaster, because the discussions of fundamental moral issues were everlasting. It was very difficult to get on to the more practical points that we were meant to be discussing, because nobody was agreed about the basic ethical principles.</p>

<a name="71212-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07121291000049"></a>One has to be realistic. Questions of ethics cannot be settled by a yes or a no; they are questions about which people feel very deeply. If what comes out of deliberation is going to have any effect, people must be prepared to compromise and see how a law governing a particular practice would work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07121291000050"></a>It is a mistake to think that this House does not take ethics seriously. No one who has sat through these debates, or the debates in 1990, or the debates on the Bills of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, about euthanasia, could possibly think that we did not take ethics seriously&#151;of course, we do. However, we learn that compromise has to be accepted, not only between different people&#146;s views, but also between the purpose of law and individual conscience. That is the most difficult thing of all when one is talking not about one&#146;s private conscience, but about something which might be incorporated in law, where we have to take into account a much more general consideration; namely, the good of society. An ethics committee of the kind proposed would probably generate great excitement and passion&#151;heaven help whoever is chair&#151;but it would not have nearly as much practical utility as have the existing commissions, particularly the Nuffield committee.</p>

I, too, have been greatly impressed by a number of debates on ethical issues in this House during the past 17 years or so. I have found them interesting, informative, enlightening and very responsible. However, they are piecemeal; they are highly reactive; they do not tackle any issues before the time comes to address them. As a result, decisions based on them are made hurriedly.

There is a need for continuous examination of the series of challenges, for which we have to legislate, on ethical academic strengths. Many academics who have spoken are undoubtedly aware of the ethical issues involved and want to address them, but the raw material for doing so is scarce and not often authoritative.</p>

<a name="71212-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07121291000053"></a>A commission such as is described in the amendment would provide an opportunity for different groups to debate differences.

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07121291000054"></a>I am sorry to say that a number of the objections today have been territorially based; that is, for maintenance of existing territory.</p>

The Nuffield Council does wonderful work, but it has strong science links and is supported by the Wellcome Foundation, which is a medical research charity of great power and influence. Those links make the Nuffield Council unsuitable for the task addressed by the amendment, quite apart from the fact that it does not have an audience which could be respected. A government-backed commission of the type proposed would attract public attention and even the attention of our ephemeral press, though that is perhaps rather more questionable. I would plead for a slightly less negative approach and slightly less territorial defence than I have detected in the debate today.</p>

I shall make a point that was perhaps overlooked when the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans made a similar point at Second Reading. He spoke about the absence of a sufficiently obvious ethical base to the Bill. It has struck me ever since that we have overlooked the fact that there is a strong ethical basis to the Bill: it was set in 1990 and it has endured. The fact that the Government and all noble Lords who have so far participated so in the drawing-up of the legislation have already agreed, acknowledged and worked to those principles, which are so embedded in what we do, may perhaps lead people to read our debates and miss that point. I have sat here for the duration of the debate. The distinction which is being suggested between those who are practitioners and those who are not, on the basis of their commitment to an ethical principle, is simply unfounded.</p>

<a name="71212-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07121291000058"></a>Noble Lords may or may not be aware that there is a growing practice within the NHS to have not only local research ethics committees but also local clinical ethics committees. My great fear is that some of the motivation for setting up yet another body is a desire to slow down the pace of research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07121291000059"></a>Noble Lords should remember that earlier this year two of our world-leading scientific research teams stopped work in order that they could be guided by Parliament after this Bill had been discussed. As I listened to the speech of noble Lord, Lord Patten, I became more and more convinced that there is something wrong with this debate and this proposal. We ignore the technical and commercial application of these principles at our peril. The technicians and people involved in technical developments in a commercial capacity are often at the very forefront of uncovering new applications, to which ethical consideration has to be given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07121291000060"></a>Finally, I assume from the discussion that were this commission ever to be set up, it would not meet on a Friday afternoon.</p>

It was quite a long time ago, but it was very clear and very good. The last few days of this Committee have illustrated just how complicated this Bill is. The person who would agree with me most is the Chief Whip. I would like to support the amendment. Maybe it could be an umbrella organisation to encapsulate all the other suggestions and to sort out and sift through some of the ethical matters. I was interested in the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, that a parliamentary committee should do this. Maybe this is something that should be looked at.</p>

That was not why I got up; I got up to support my noble friend Lady Warnock and the valuable work done by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. We do it an injustice to suggest that it is financed by research bodies and therefore reacts only to these kinds of issues. Its most recent report, in September 2007, <I>The </I><I>f</I><I>orensic </I><I>u</I><I>se of </I><I>bio</I><I>information: </I><I>ethical issues</I>, formed the basis of some of the legislation that was drafted and passed.

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07121291000063"></a>We also have the Human Genetics Commission, whose terms of reference are not only to analyse current and potential developments in human genetics and advise Ministers on their likely impact on human health and healthcare, but to look at social, ethical, legal and economic implications and advise on strategic paths for research. Therefore, if we are going to have the committee&#151;no matter what its form, although I would favour a parliamentary committee&#151;we must take account of what gap it will be filling.

I fully recognise the interest of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, in seeing a national human bioethics commission established.

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07121291000065"></a>A number of noble Lords have referred to the possibility of a parliamentary standing committee on bioethics, but I will address that issue separately. In relation to establishing a national human bioethics commission, the Government considered whether to establish a single commission with a remit covering the entirety of bioethical issues as part of the Department of Health&#146;s review of its arm&#146;s-length bodies. This was rejected after careful consideration on the basis that the present distributed model of advisory bodies with more specific briefs remained the best option, as it enabled specific bioethical issues to be addressed by dedicated groups. These include the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, the Human Genetics Commission, the BMA medical ethics committee and the National Screening Committee. They have the appropriate expertise and sufficient time to devote to complex issues within their fields. Noble Lords have spoken of the healthy debate on bioethical issues in a vast range of organisations and learned societies, whose membership is diverse. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for informing us of the various ethics committees within the NHS itself. They do sterling work.</p>

<a name="71212-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07121291000066"></a>The Nuffield Council, of which we have heard much, was established in 1991. It is a body completely independent of government. It has, for example, published reports and discussion papers on such issues as behavioural genetics, patenting DNA and ethical decisions in treating very premature babies. I, for one, am absolutely delighted that the noble and right reverend Lord is a member of the Nuffield Council. The Human Genetics Commission, chaired until recently by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, was set up by the Government in 1999. I give way.</p>

Because of its expertise and authority, its reports, which always go to the Government, are taken very seriously.

As far as the Human Genetics Commission is concerned, it is free to set its own work plan and it ranges widely in the issues it chooses to consider. As noble Lords will agree, Parliamentary Select Committees also play an important role in the current system. Examples include, the House of Lords Select Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Harries, which looked at stem cell research, and the Select Committee chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, which looked at the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07121291000071"></a>I am not being territorial when I say that the current system also means that there is collective responsibility for bioethical debate, which ensures that ethical discussion is embedded in decisions across all committees. I note, of course, what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester said when he spoke of his concern about the status of ethical questions. While I perhaps understand his concern in relation to wider society, I feel, like the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, that the many profound debates that we have in this House are soundly rooted in ethics and our shared values. Of course, more discussion on the issues is always welcome. The noble Baroness, Lady Knight, is not longer in her seat, but I would respectfully say to her that we discussed some very difficult issues while debating the Bill. The discussions have been of a high quality. I would like to address these two issues separately.</p>

The Government&#146;s response was that they shared the committee&#146;s view of the value of consideration of bioethical issues in Parliament, but the decision about whether to establish a joint bioethics committee of both Houses is, of course, for Parliament to consider. It may well be that such a committee would bridge the information gap that was mentioned by the noble Baronesses, Lady Williams and Lady Finlay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07121291000075"></a>We remain of the view that it is for Parliament to consider such issues. In giving consideration to how this might be taken forward by Parliament, I am sure that the Committee will recognise that a number of key issues would need to be thought through very carefully in order to ensure that such a committee could operate effectively and have the confidence of Parliament and the wider society as a whole&#151;particularly its composition. As we heard today, it would be an extraordinarily difficult decision to take. Its remit and its relationship with other parliamentary Select Committees, Joint Committees and current ethical bodies would need to be clear. The way it would relate to the excellent work undertaken by scrutiny committees such as those for the Mental Capacity and Mental Health Bills, the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill and this current Bill would also need to be resolved.</p>

She is quite right of course that our debates in these four days have demonstrated the breadth of opinion in your Lordships' House, its expertise and, indeed, its commitment to look for good ethics as well as good science. If that could be replicated on a regular basis, looking at issues as and when they arise&#151;because they do arise, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said in her contribution, with great rapidity&#151;there would be no difficulty and no need for such a proposal. It is precisely because we do not meet for four days in a Committee of this House on a regular basis other than when Bills are before us that there is what several Members of the Committee have described as a gap. My noble friend Lady Finlay talked about a gap needing to be filled. We need to plug that gap, as she said. This is one way in which that could be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07121291000078"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester, in his contribution, mentioned a suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Elton, that we should have a debate about this at Report before we proceed to decide on some of the momentous issues that are inside the Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, was good enough to say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, at Second Reading, that she hoped to facilitate a debate in a choreographed way, with a debate on the

I hope that that will be possible. As I said at Second Reading, I feel that we have been a little back-to-front in the way that we have gone about these questions. It would have been good to have had this debate at the head of all our proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07121291000079"></a>My noble friend Lady Deech spoke with great experience from her time as chairman of the HFEA, but I disagreed with what she said about experience in other countries. It is unfair to label them as either unregulated or religious because many countries have national bioethics commissions. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, gave some examples in his memorandum to the Joint Committee. They are countries such as France, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium and Australia. As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, pointed out, France is secular and none of those countries could be described as a religious society. Indeed, at paragraph 34 of the memorandum of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121291000146"></a>&#147;it is pertinent that France with its tradition of secularism maintains a statutory requirement for the presence of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish thinkers on the CCNE. This is not in order to placate people, but to ensure that a proper range of positions and philosophies are addressed and considered when documents are produced&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71212-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07121291000080"></a>To pick up a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, I entirely agree about the experience that one can derive about politics from the experience in local government. Whether Dundee or Liverpool, I suspect that we have both had some of those same experiences.</p>

<a name="71212-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07121291000081"></a>At paragraph 43, the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, looked at other jurisdictions. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07121291000137"></a>&#147;In Australia, members are appointed on a renewable 3-year basis by the Minister for Health ... France selects its members differently: eight are chosen by the President, and the remainder, representing a range of academic, professional and scientific positions, are chosen by a range of ministers and academic and professional bodies. German members are nominated by the Chancellor; Danish by a combination of ministries and committees of the legislature. It is clear that appointment from central government has not harmed the reputation or output of these bodies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71212-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07121291000082"></a>It would be disingenuous of us to suggest that we necessarily have this absolutely right in this country and everyone else has got it wrong. My noble friend Lord Tombs made an important point when he said that we can get rather territorial about these things. I would not want my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries of Pentregarth to feel that he is being got at, but I was struck that paragraph 36 of the memorandum of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, referred to my noble friend. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07121291000138"></a>&#147;For an example of the far from ideal state of British appointments, it is not entirely healthy that of the three best known bodies in England (the HFEA, the HGC and the Nuffield Council), only two have any clerical members at all, and in both cases the member is Lord Harries of Pentregarth&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121291000130"></a>I know that my noble and right reverend friend believes in the principle of three persons in one, but one person on two bodies and all others excluded is not a healthy situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07121291000085"></a>I do not wish to chide my noble and right reverend friend. I have considerable regard for him and although we often disagree about these issues I know that he has applied his mind to these questions over the years. I know that he would agree because in a debate about the HFEA the other day he said that it would be &#147;difficult&#148;&#151;to use his word&#151;for anyone who believed in the sanctity of human life from fertilisation to be appointed to the HFEA. He would agree that that is what he said.</p>

It is not the same when it comes to individual committees of the HFEA where people can be co-opted. In fact, the Ethics and Law Committee of the HFEA, which I chair, has co-opted a Roman Catholic member.</p>

That would exclude the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester and many others who hold that view. It surely cannot be very healthy in our society to exclude other opinion, even if it is dissenting or minority opinion. It would be far healthier to have a plurality of views.</p>

There is an issue of good faith and bad faith; we have raised that point before. I am certainly not accusing the noble Lord of bad faith&#151;I would not dream of doing so&#151;but I do not see how one can go on to a body in good faith and be effectively so hostile to its purpose and intent that one cannot but seem to act as though one were seeking to sabotage the purpose for which Parliament has appointed that body. I am not suggesting any challenge to anyone&#146;s individual integrity. I am sure that one would seek to mediate in that situation. However, it raises a profound issue of bad faith, and the way to avoid that is for Parliament to be the forum for those debates. When Parliament in its wisdom has judged that an institution or non-departmental public body should be set up to facilitate the will of Parliament, it is bad faith for individuals to go on to that body to seek to subvert that which Parliament has authorised.</p>

However, if you go on to a body associated with embryo research, when you believe that that process is fundamentally wrong because you believe that a life is created at the point of procreation, that would be problematic. In various letters I have received, and I do not doubt that other noble Lords have received similar letters, people have said to me that when dealing with human embryos the size of a grain of sand we are talking about tiny human beings. That suggests issues of problematic faith in the integrity of one&#146;s position.</p>

The parallel I was drawing was that it is not impossible for someone like that to serve, even on a regulatory authority. For instance, I serve on a local ethics committee at my university that deals with animal experimentation, and there is member of that committee who opposes vivisection. He is not there to subvert or sabotage; he is there to question. As I argued earlier, it is legitimate for someone to be on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority as amicus curiae to argue on behalf of the human embryo. We have used 2 million human embryos, either in IVF cycles or in experimentation, in the past 17 years. Surely it is legitimate to have someone questioning whether repetition, duplication, and so on is necessary. Although I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is not suggesting that I would want to subvert or sabotage such a body, appointing people who could act in good faith to question the necessity of the numbers of human embryos currently used is worthy of further consideration.</p>

It is beginning to come across as strongly as the territoriality which the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, referred to earlier. Some of the recent interventions to which he has just responded have suggested that people of a particular faith or view, or who care for the embryo&#151;however it is stigmatised or parodied&#151;should be excluded from these great committees because they are not politically correct enough to be on them. Does that not make the case for a national bioethics commission, which we hope will be a broader body that could consider the broader bioethical issues?</p>

The noble Lord said&#151;and it was confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord Patten&#151;that the case for the national bioethics commission was being made.

However, when the Science and Technology Committee looked at these questions, it argued for both, and that is what I have been arguing for today. It is not one or the other; the 2004 report said that we should do both. In answer to noble Baroness, Lady Carnegie, it also asserted the importance of local ethics committees. That is worthy of review. My noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries suggested that the existing parliamentary committees, he mentioned the Science and Technology Committee, were capable of doing these things. However, the recent report of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee looked at the issue of late abortion. At the outset of its enquiry it specifically excluded any consideration of the ethical issues. It said that it did not want to look at those questions. That is a matter for the committee, but that is not doing the job that we have argued for today.</p>

I said at the outset that I have considerable admiration for it. I have seen many of its reports that warrant our detailed attention. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, at paragraph 40 of his memorandum, cited the example of genetically modified crops, which perhaps bears out a point that the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, made:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07121291000140"></a>&#147;For example, with GM crops &#147;unnaturalness&#148; is a very major part of popular discomfort&#151;albeit one that is often dismissed as nonsense in scientific circles.

Some of us have been arguing for a parliamentary committee that could draw upon the strengths of and work in tandem with the expertise that exists, and there a great amount of it in science and technology, particularly because we wish to see a body that will look at coming technical and scientific developments, and their ethical implications as one of its main tasks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07121291000105"></a>I want to conclude by going back to a point that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, made about the fast-moving pace of science. A report that appeared in the <I>New Yor</I><I>k</I><I> Times</I><I></I>yesterday quoted Professor Shinya Yamanaka, who has reprogrammed adult cells to create embryonic stem cells:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07121291000141"></a>&#147;When I saw the embryo, I suddenly realized&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121291000131"></a>this was after he looked down his microscope&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07121291000147"></a>&#147;there was such a small difference between it and my daughters ... I thought, we can&#146;t keep destroying embryos for our research. There must be another way&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121291000132"></a>As these extraordinary scientific developments are moving, some of the ethical dilemmas that we have had to face may be solved to the satisfaction of science, the parliamentary bodies that we have been discussing and ourselves. However, if we do not apprise ourselves of these things as we proceed, how will we know?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07121291000112"></a>Clause 39(1)(b) is about whether,</p>

<p><a name="07121291000133"></a>and so on. This will probably be called the Diane Blood amendment, so I shall call it that myself, because that is where the need for clarification comes from. In 1995 Mr Blood died of meningitis, and we have had a lot of legislation since. I fully acknowledge that taking sentences out of a judgment sometimes makes for an inappropriate quotation, but two passages leapt out at me from the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. The first is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07121291000143"></a>&#147;The result is that in the ordinary way no preservation can take place unless the required written consents exist&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121291000134"></a>That related to the preservation of extracted sperm from the man. Secondly, the final paragraph states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07121291000144"></a>&#147;Our decision means that, unless fresh sperm are being used, there will always be a need for written consent which complies with the Schedule. It seems therefore that in future those who are responsible who for treating a man and a woman together should take the precaution of having the necessary consent, not only to storage but also to enable that treatment to continue if the man should have the misfortune to die before the sperm is sperm&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07121291000135"></a>I fear that that last word might be a misprint on the website, and should be &#147;used&#148;. That judgment related to the 1990 Act&#151;the Act that we are looking to revise&#151;hence my questions.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07121291000113"></a>In the Mental Capacity Act, we now have provision for an advanced statement of wishes, which, if properly recorded, must be considered when a best-interest decision is taken on a patient. I put &#147;married&#148; in the amendment because I felt that it was a clear, external demonstration of a commitment&#151;one could assume a lifelong commitment&#151;to provide a stable environment in which a couple would have children. Let us take a married couple who want to conceive and are having sex regularly, and it is clear that they are completely committed to each other and to having a child together. Maybe when they are advised to carry on trying, and to try certain times in the month and avoid others and so on, and that is clear to their GP, the man becomes ill and dies. They are fully aware that the woman could conceive and that, within a month, the man could be killed in a road accident. In that event, the advanced statement of wishes could or should be respected. The man could state that it would be deemed to be in his best interests as a person, should he become severely incapacitated, for his sperm to be withdrawn and stored so that the woman&#151;at a future date, when she has recovered from the bereavement&#151;could use his sperm rather than anyone else&#146;s, if she so wishes and decides to go for infertility treatment. That would be lawful.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07121291000114"></a>The man&#146;s sperm might already be held when he dies. According to the Bill, I understand that it would then be lawful to use that sperm, because all the consent forms would have been written. The other situation that could arise is, of course, that the bereaved woman still wishes to have a family on her own. She could go to an infertility clinic and might be accepted

For her, the rest of her family and the situation in which she finds herself, the sperm of her dead husband might be the material that is ideally wished to be used.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07121291000115"></a>It is in that spirit that I wanted to explore the matter. That is why I crafted the amendment as I did. I look forward to the Government&#146;s reply. I have had advance notice, which I appreciate, that the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, will oppose the amendment, but I seek clarification. I beg to move.</p>

It grieves me to disagree even with her probing, because I so admire her leadership in medical matters.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07121291000117"></a>When sperm is taken from a man before his death, he is able to consent; his mere co-operation with the procedure is consent. There is no more valuable and ethical principle&#151;every point of view on every committee mentioned this afternoon would agree&#151;than consent. That is embedded throughout the Bill. The situation to which the noble Baroness refers is one where the man is dead or on a life-support machine, has not given any written consent, and sperm is to be taken from him completely without his knowledge. The lawyers would have a field day with the amendment, because it refers to marriage; I am sure that there would be a human rights challenge saying that cohabitation and any intimate relationship must have the same rights. How would one know whether people were trying to conceive? We would have the word of only the widow on that.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07121291000118"></a>I hark back to my practical experience. In the period of the Diane Blood case, we got a phone call&#151;no doubt on a Friday afternoon&#151;from parents saying that their son had died in a motorbike accident that afternoon and asking for his sperm to be extracted; there is a window of only a few hours in which that can be done. I replied, &#147;We would all like to be grandparents, but that does not enable us to manipulate the bodies of our nearest and dearest&#148;. One essential element to consent is that we must all have control as far as possible over our reproductive future and our gametes, which are not the same as other tissues. They are quite different because of the family implications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07121291000119"></a>The Blood case involved a straightforward assault, and was admitted as such by the judgment of my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf. The Government followed the case with a report by Professor Sheila McLean, with which the Government agreed when her conclusions came forth. Her report and the Court of Appeal judgment said that that must never happen again because it was an absolutely straightforward assault on a dying and then a dead man.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07121291000121"></a>How would it come about? A man on a life support machine or a dead man would have his sperm removed either by cutting into the scrotum or by electro-ejaculation, which involves the insertion of a baton into the rectum to deliver electric shocks which apparently produces sperm in the bladder from whence it can be removed. I spell that out to the Committee because the nature of the assault on the dead body has to be understood. In such a situation, not only has the man not consented, but he will not even know what is happening. In response to the McLean report and to my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf, the Government accepted that was wrong, although everyone concerned had sympathy with the lawyers.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07121291000122"></a>The fact that a marriage has taken place makes no difference: for example, for centuries it was argued that a husband could rape his wife because in the course of the wedding ceremony she had given her consent for all time to sexual intercourse. That was changed a number of years ago. However, the principle is the same. On marriage one does not yield up all control over sexual matters or reproduction. It is for each one of us to give our consent and to decide whether that should or should not happen. Many men&#151;I understand soldiers going into danger do this&#151;may wish to freeze a sample of their sperm and indicate that it may be used after their death and any piece of writing will suffice.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07121291000123"></a>The situation we are addressing and which I regard as totally unethical is to remove sperm from a dead man. Because of the law of human rights, that would apply equally to a woman&#146;s eggs. If the amendment were passed, it would lead to a human rights challenge, which I am sure would be won. Imagine a young woman dies, say, in a high-speed car crash and maybe her husband, fianc&#233; or boyfriend goes to the hospital and says, &#147;Please remove her eggs and freeze them; I will fertilise them with my sperm; and I will find a surrogate mother to bring the child to birth&#148;. Or imagine, without naming names, that a young woman dies in a high-speed car crash, as does her boyfriend, and the father of one or other goes to the hospital in that very narrow window of time in which the sperm and eggs can be taken and says, &#147;Take the sperm and the eggs; they told me they were going to get married; I know that that is their wish; please freeze them and I will pay a great deal of money for a surrogate mother to carry the baby to term&#148;.</p>

<a name="71212-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07121291000124"></a>I will not go on because the night is drawing on, but I urge the Committee to consider the integrity of the human body and the need for us to be able to consent or not to our reproductive future. I am afraid that marriage in this context makes no difference; we are all autonomous. I very much hope that the amendment, which has been considered by government bodies in the past, will not be pursued.</p>

<a name="07121291000125"></a><b><a name="71212-0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121291000201"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> Clause 39 replaces, for the future, the provisions inserted into the 1990 Act by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003. These provisions relate to the registration of a man on the birth certificate of a child born using his sperm&#151;or an embryo created using his sperm&#151;after his death. As the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, rightly says, the vital word here is &#147;consent&#148;. Amendment No. 66A tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, would allow a married woman to register her deceased husband as the father of her child, where his sperm was used, or an embryo was created with his sperm, without the need for his written consent, if they were married and trying to conceive at the time of his death.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07121291000126"></a>The Bill clearly specifies that written consent is needed from any man, whether married or not, and I feel that this is necessary to avoid any uncertainty about his intentions. Using a man&#146;s sperm or an embryo created from his sperm after his death is a significant step. The Government are of the view that it is important that such a step is taken only with that man&#146;s explicit written consent. That ensures clarity and certainty about his wishes. In addition to removing such clarity, this amendment would introduce a two-tier system of consent in which a married man would not have to provide it but an unmarried man would. The Bill allows for unmarried and married couples to be treated consistently and the amendment would introduce a discrepancy. I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I was talking about an advance statement, which we have already debated under the Mental Capacity Act and which one is now asked, in law, to consider in the making of a &#147;best interest&#148; decision, if one takes a decision which could potentially be viewed as an assault on someone. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said that any piece of writing would suffice. Therefore, can the Minister clarify the situation of a couple who are trying to conceive? They have written down and lodged with someone such as their GP a piece of paper saying, &#147;We are trying to conceive but in the event of my potential death, I would want to have sperm extracted from my body and stored so that it can be used in the future&#148;. Would that fall within the law? It is very important for couples, whether married or not, to know the position. If the situation has arisen once and it can arise again.</p>

It is important that consent is given.</p>

My understanding is that what could be considered to be an advance statement could also be used as evidence of consent to the process. Although the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has laid out very graphically the process of extracting sperm, I remind the Committee that when someone is dead

They may be declared brain dead but one can still extract sperm using the method described. I wanted to explore that because of the changes in legislation that we have had since that decision was made and because I understand that Diane Blood, to whom I referred earlier, has had a second pregnancy using the sperm that was withdrawn earlier. So, long-term storage outside the UK occurred and another pregnancy took place and the father is now registered on the birth certificate as the person to whom she was married.</p>

That would put us in a very interesting situation in relation to the questions debated in the Committee on Monday about a child&#146;s need for a father. I could conceive&#151;wrong word, forgive me; that was not intentional&#151;I can imagine that a man and his wife might well change their minds radically when facing terminal illness and imminent death. That needs to be taken into account as a further subsidiary element to the very powerful points that the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has made.</p>

In previous debates there were very strong cases made&#151;with which I concur&#151;for a child&#146;s need for parenting from more than one person but that the parenting does not necessarily have to be from the biological father.

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07121296000018"></a>The noble Baroness said: I will try not to detain the Committee too long but there are some important issues here. These amendments actually call into play Clause 46, which in a way is in the wrong place. They are about the fundamental purposes of birth registration. We are talking about a birth registration in these clauses, not a record of the legal relationship between the adults. It is the welfare of the child that is paramount in English law, not the formal benefits that might accrue to the parents. Using birth certificates to record the adult relationship is not the way to certify the relationship between two people of the same sex or to secure their obligations to the child. Paragraphs 1 to 9 of Schedule 6 provide for two women&#151;and it would have to include two men as well&#151;to be registered as parents on a birth certificate and for the legitimacy of the offspring.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07121296000019"></a>In an earlier set of amendments your Lordships considered without much favour the notion of marking a birth certificate with the information that the child was conceived by donor gametes. The arguments against that amendment were the invasion of privacy and the interference with parental concerns about when and what to tell a child. The provisions of Schedule 6 regarding the birth certificate suffer from the same problems, which are indeed exacerbated. For without even the slight disguise provided by a symbol, it will be  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_290"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>immediately apparent to anyone perusing the certificate that the child was born either from donor sperm or a donor embryo or to a surrogate mother. These facts and circumstances apparently accompanying them will be broadcast wherever the birth certificate is produced&#151;government departments, schools, passport agencies and all the other organisations that require a full birth certificate. Now that everything these days is globalised&#151;another way of saying that we travel a lot&#151;the certificate with two parents of the same sex on it will divulge facts like that in parts of the world which, unlike us, might treat the situation with considerable disfavour.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07121296000020"></a>The birth registration will be used to gain nationality, too, in circumstances where fraud is all too easy. It could be used where the mother has conceived naturally and wants to exclude the natural father. The birth certificate with two same-sex parents will give insufficient information to help towards identifying antecedents and will give rise to unnecessary anxiety about possible medical problems which could not be resolved. The child might not even know which of, say, two women on the birth certificate is actually physically the mother. It should be recalled that the tendency of this entire Bill and its thrust is towards greater truth in IVF&#151;truth for children about their origin&#151;and this is not the way to do it. I am sure your Lordships favour the assumption of legal responsibility by same-sex parents for their children and there are ways to achieve this in law that do not hinge on the birth certificate record. Nor is the birth certificate the way to formalise a particular link that exists between two parents of the same sex. Perhaps a special domestic cohabitation certificate should be devised instead to fulfil that need rather than the distortion of the birth register for all time.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07121296000021"></a>Clause 46 is the most egregious of the registration provisions. It provides that after the death of a same-sex partner, he or she may be registered as the child&#146;s parent on the birth certificate. The deceased&#146;s partner will never have seen or known the child and has no genetic relationship with the child. Their family may or may not in the circumstances bond with the child. Registration of a deceased partner of a mother is of no value to the child socially but may leave the child with a lifelong sense of fiction to which the state should not be a party. It does not provide for inheritance rights. All it would record where one of two partners is dead is that the two women or men were intimate friends. This may be a comfort but it is of no practical benefit to the child born after the death of one of them. The authenticity of consent in relationships is very hard to prove when death has removed one of the parties. We need to be careful not to trespass on the wishes, or worse still the bodies, of deceased loved ones and there is a danger in Clause 39 if consent is not strictly adhered to.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07121296000022"></a>Overall, the schedule puts the demands of adults ahead of the rights of children to know and benefit from both sides of their genetic makeup. It sits uneasily with the ending of donor anonymity. As recently as this June, John Hutton, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, called in a paper for the numbers of children with no father on the birth certificate to be reduced. That paper is on the Department for Work and Pensions website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07121296000023"></a>Members of the Committee know that not all unions between two adults can be the same, or must be treated the same, for all purposes. UK law still does not recognise, for example, underage, incestuous or polygamous marriages. It is the hallmark of a civilised society to set boundaries around mating and conception to control, for example, abortion laws, the age at which children may consent to sex, marriage and the prohibited degrees. If two parties of the same sex have to take steps other than birth certificate registration to seek legal responsibility for a child, as is the case now, at least that ensures that the welfare principle will be considered by the court.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07121296000024"></a>Articles 7 and 8 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provide the,</p>
<ul><a name="07121296000152"></a>&#147;right to know and be cared for by his or her parents&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121296000125"></a>and the right of the child,</p>
<ul><a name="07121296000153"></a>&#147;to preserve his or her identity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121296000126"></a>Those rights are threatened by these provisions. This is not a moral issue: it is about disguising true facts. We know that computer records can be insecure and possibly vulnerable, but the birth certificate is the record for generations to come. The study of ancestry should be remembered; there is a need for truth in these situations.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07121296000025"></a>This schedule confuses biological genetic parenthood and legal social parenthood. There is a risk of creating a legal and social quagmire of adult claims and counterclaims over the children&#146;s status. It would mark a shift in the function and purpose of birth certificates. Instead of providing for all time permanent and available information about biological parentage, birth certificates would be used to assign legal and financial responsibility to non-related individuals. The door was opened to this by the 1990 Act, but the full consequences were not foreseen. The child might not even know which of the two mothers bore him.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07121296000026"></a>Civil partnerships differ legislatively from marriages in a number of respects. There is no reason to suppose that civil partnerships were intended to create a new procreated unit. One should note that dignity and titles of honour are exempted from the new provisions on registering two people of the same sex on a birth certificate. That must mean that there is some notion that truth is important. If it is important for titles of honour and dignity, then it is important for everyone else. Birth certificates are about origins, not statements of adult commitment, which should be made elsewhere. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07121296000029"></a>I want to make a point of information. There can only ever be one mother registered on a birth certificate&#151;  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_292"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the mother who carries the child. I have suspected for the past few weeks that there was some confusion in the Committee about what the Bill&#146;s provisions would mean. My Amendment No. 68A would propose that the birth certificates for everyone, no matter how they were conceived, would consist of the following information: name, name of a mother and name of a father&#151;to which I shall return&#151;or a parent. It is also important to recognise that, since the passage of the 1990 Act, the name of a father on a birth certificate is not the name of a donor. It never has been. That sets a problem for us, as it did on Monday, when we begin to discuss different matters.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07121296000030"></a>Birth certificates are about the relationships of the adults to children. They are not a way of recording the relationships of the adults to each other; that is what other forms of certification have always been for, whether marriage certificates, civil partnership certificates or divorce certificates. Birth certificates are about registering the relationship of the parents to the children.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07121296000031"></a>On Monday, the noble Viscount, Lord Craigavon, helpfully pointed us back to another bit of truth. A longitudinal and international study by Liverpool John Moores University suggested that, were the population to be tested&#151;and before eyes on the government Front Bench light up, I am not suggesting for a moment that it should be&#151;somewhere between 10 per cent and 25 per cent of people would turn out to have a genetic father who is different from the person we consider to be our father. Why? It is partly because people have lied on birth certificates ever since birth certificates have been around. People have chosen either not to register information or they have at times put down false information. Why? It is for all the reasons that people exist. I suspect that when people chose to do it, they did it for one outstanding reason: they thought it was in the best interests of the child. In any type of relationship, truth can sometimes be very difficult to live with.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07121296000032"></a>In the many debates that we have had in your Lordships&#146; House about matters such as civil partnerships and the adoption Bill, I have always found it strange that the people who seem to attract the greatest condemnation are gay people who choose to submit themselves to close examination of their personal lives. They are seeking to do only one thing&#151;to have their commitment to one another, and their attempts to build secure and strong families, legally recognised.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07121296000033"></a>I take issue with the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, only on the suggestion that those of us who take a different view from her seek to put the needs of adults above those of children. We do not. Many of us believe that it is in the best interests of children that they are born into and live in secure and loving families and that those families, however they are made up, are recognised. Three times now in our discussions the noble Baroness has juxtaposed relationships of very different types&#151;polygamous, underage and incestuous relationships, all of which are illegal for reasons of duress or consanguinity&#151;with gay relationships, which are none of those things and are legally recognised. It is unhelpful that she continues to do so.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07121296000034"></a>The noble Baroness talked about the measures setting up a quagmire. I do not believe that they do. I consider that they bring clarity for these families, who have existed for a long time. Some of us heard the very moving speech in which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, set out for noble Lords who might otherwise not be aware that there have always been gay couples who have felt the same compulsion and need to have children that exists in the rest of the population. They have always had to act in hidden and informal ways and they have often been blighted by a lack of legal recognition. I know a person who has, over many years, brought up the child of her partner, who died. She was reliant on the good will of officials to turn a blind eye at many turns in that child&#146;s life in order to continue giving him the loving and stable relationship that he needed.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07121296000035"></a>I tabled my amendment because I believe that it represents a truth about modern life. I ask noble Lords who share the views of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, this question. Are they going to follow the logic of it and repeal the Civil Partnership Act and overturn the sexual orientation regulations, which are the laws under which gay people have an equal right to receive the same public services as the rest of us? That would be the consequence of the amendment.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07121296000036"></a>I believe that this is a matter of truth but, more than anything else, I believe that it is a test of whether this House can demonstrate that it understands and keeps pace with the way in which modern life is changing, and changing for the better.</p>

<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="07121296000037"></a><b><a name="71212-0010.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="07121296000178"></a>The Lord Bishop of Winchester:</b> It certainly did not seem to me that the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, justified what has just been said about them by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. Even for someone who has significant reservations about some of the measures that she has just described, it is amply possible to recognise that they are the law and that they are not threatened by the things that the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07121296000038"></a>I am grateful for what the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said. I want to make five observations and then return to one thing that she mentioned early in her speech. The first point where it seems to me that she is right and where I disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, concerns the question of birth certificates. Given a choice between disagreeing with what is a fiction in relation to the child and the question of the current adult relationship, it seems to me that we must follow the proposal to remove these paragraphs from the Bill and not create a fiction about the child. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, is right in saying that that is what a birth certificate fundamentally relates to.</p>

<a name="71212-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07121296000039"></a>Secondly, although I do not want to get into this in any detail, some of us raised this point some years ago during the passage of the Gender Recognition Bill. It seemed to some of us that serious things were being done to the integrity of birth certificates. I do not reopen the question&#151;we lost that argument&#151;but it is something that this House would be wise not to get into the habit of doing, because these are very important documents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07121296000040"></a>Thirdly, I want to question something that the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said. I was very surprised when I thought I heard her say that disguising facts was not a moral issue. I should have thought that it was an intensely moral issue, particularly as, throughout her speech, she talked about truth, which I welcomed.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07121296000041"></a>Fourthly, I was unable to be here on Monday, although I have read the debate in <I>Hansard.</I> However, had I been here, I should have wanted to note that, notwithstanding the legal definitions of &#147;parent&#148;, which at one point were carefully drawn out in relation to both English and Scottish law, I did not notice anyone saying that there is a still more fundamental question. My understanding of the word &#147;parent&#148; is that it means a progenitor. It means a mother or a father in the strictest physical sense, whether by donation or whatever. It means, in the genetic sense, a mother or father. Although I recognise the interests of this Bill, I am very troubled by what I see as an untruthful widening of the meaning of &#147;parent&#148;.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07121296000042"></a>That leads me to a fifth point. It may seem abstruse but, like the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, I think that it is a fundamental and legitimate point to mention. My profound concern is that, as I understand it, the Government will apply the Whip to the Bill in both this House and the other place. This is one of the many points in the Bill where there seem to be legitimate questions relating to doing things to &#147;truth&#148;. It is a very regrettable point at which Members of this House and the other place may be Whipped rather than having a free vote.</p>

I find that an unfortunate way of suggesting that those who believe in a government measure based on wide consultation followed by draft and pre-scrutiny legislation&#151;a measure that some individuals take issue with, although I certainly do not suggest that they do so in bad faith&#151;are themselves acting in bad faith and deforming truth. I find that unfortunate.</p>

Before he leaves that point, I should like to concur with what he has just said. The Science and Technology Committee and, I believe, the Joint Committee said that there were clear questions of conscience here and that this might well be territory in which free votes should be permitted. Certainly, that is precisely what happened in another place with the 1990 legislation. When we debated it there, there were free votes on these questions. I think

As my noble friend Lady Hollis pointed out, this is a government Bill, and there has been very wide consultation on it. It is therefore Whipped, apart from any vote which may occur on the subject of abortion. However, because it involves clearly moral and sometimes very difficult issues, if individuals have a problem in relation to any part of the Bill, the government Chief Whip will look on that very kindly. Therefore, one must not think of this as a draconian Whip. This is government business and so we have a Whip. If, however, individual noble Lords have a problem, it is possible for them not to be here or whatever.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07121296000048"></a>My last point is rather more delicate but I believe it is worth raising in the Committee the issue of where truth lies and, more widely, the issue of conscience. At an early point in her speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, spoke about entries in forms and, if I heard her correctly, perhaps a need to change the names on the columns of birth certificates. The Committee should understand that the result of the civil partnership legislation, which I accept is the law, is that way down the line significant numbers of parish clergy&#151;and among the parish clergy there are some who are by no means happy about the civil partnership legislation&#151;will find themselves thinking that they are bound to collude with it in filling in the new forms sent out by the registrar general for registering marriages. There are serious question of conscience there. There have been questions of conscience for those who are employed as civil registrars. I foresee some difficulties in offices in various parts of government at the point at which a fiction enters into birth certificates if these provisions are passed. Those are among my further reasons for thinking that the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and others are on to something very significant in their opposition to these&#151;</p>

I cannot accept his reading of abuse of conscience in terms of civil registrars. I understand that in terms of clergy&#151;certainly for a non-state church, although one could argue about the responsibilities of a state church&#151;but where secular, appointed officials hold down a job under parliamentary writ and authority, their conscience in good faith is to all of the ramifications of that job as laid down by law. They may not pick and chose to decide that they will or will not, for example, register somebody who is black or yellow or brown or too small or too large or gay. That is part of the responsibility that comes with holding office by law established.</p>

Since December 2005, same sex couples have been able to have their relationships legally recognised. From that time, couples registering as civil partners have had the same rights and responsibilities as married couples in most areas of their lives, including the ability to apply for a parental responsibility order for a partner&#146;s child.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07121296000055"></a>However, while the Civil Partnership Act provided for the acquisition of parental responsibility, it did not provide for civil partners to be joint legal parents following assisted conception with donor sperm, for both partners to be legal parents of that child or for that fact to be recorded on birth certificates. The Bill allows that same-sex couples, whether in a civil partnership or being treated together, can both be legal parents of a child born through assisted conception. For these provisions to be fully legally recognised, the Bill includes amendments to other Acts to allow birth certificates under UK, Scottish and Northern Irish law to record that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07121296000056"></a>I understand that some see as a fallacy recording on a birth certificate that a child has a mother and a second parent who happens to be female. However, I must point out that a child born to a married couple by the use of donor sperm has recorded on his birth certificate that the husband is his father, although he is in fact not his biological father. Currently, if a same-sex female couple have a child as a result of

If the second parent then goes through the process of adopting the child, a new birth certificate will be produced that has the mother&#146;s name and the name of the second parent. Therefore, having the name of a mother and a second female parent on a birth certificate is not a new concept in birth registration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07121296000057"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is correct to say that there is only ever one mother on a birth certificate and there can never be confusion about who is the mother. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, referred to my right honourable friend John Hutton who said that we want more fathers on birth certificates. There is no question that where a father is legally responsible for a child we want his name on the birth certificate. We want more fathers, but in that case the mother and the father are legally responsible for the child. In the cases that we are discussing in this Bill the mother and another parent are the two people responsible for the child. Legal rights and responsibilities flow from the names cited as parents on the birth certificate. Those rights and responsibilities are in best interests of the child.</p>

This amendment is not necessary as it is already the Government&#146;s intention. The Department of Health has already been in discussions with the Office for National Statistics, and that is how the information will be recorded on birth certificates. I ask the noble Baroness not to press her amendment.</p>

My point about polygamous and incestuous marriages not being allowed is that if a child is born of such a union no doubt the names of the two parents are on the birth certificate and that is all that it means: the child&#146;s origins. It does not seem to me to be in the interests of the child&#151;and that is what we are talking about&#151;to list two people on a birth certificate, which that child will carry for the rest of his life and will have to produce all over the world, who are plainly not both his genetic parents. I know that there has been a breach in the normal rule in that children born by donor conception to wives and husbands where the husband is not the father can have the husband listed. We are now moving forward into a yet more technologically adventurous world, and it may be that in retrospect more should have been said for truth, albeit that it can be inconvenient. If your Lordships were not minded to support birth certificates that show clearly that donor conception had taken place, it is illogical to want birth certificates that name two women or two men as parents. Certificates are used for all purposes and in an increasingly globalised world will be used all over the world as proof of this and that. We should be focusing on the child&#146;s origins, not the situation of the parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07121296000060"></a>It is the case that there are still some differences in English law between the various unions. That is not to stigmatise any; there are simply a variety of unions, recognised and certificated in various ways. However, the birth certificate is something else again, so I am simply making a plea for historical truth for future generations. If the names of two women, or two men, are on the birth certificate the child would be extremely confused, and news would be broken to it far earlier than the mother might have intended. That is what I mean to say.</p>

We were debating what happens when a child is donor-conceived. My noble friend Lady Warnock made the important point about telling truth in these circumstances. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, came forward then with a thoughtful idea about the marking of a second birth certificate to illustrate that you were donor-conceived. Is that not all that my noble friend is calling for in her remarks on truthfulness in the public record?</p>

I have now become bewildered about the relation between what we talked about when discussing Amendment No. 68A and what we are now saying. I may have misunderstood her, but I thought that the Minister had promised to go further into whether any way could be devised to mark or keep a separate certificate&#151;I thought that was the proposition which the noble Earl, Lord Howe, put forward&#151;that makes it much more difficult for a child to be permanently deceived about his own origins. I should be grateful if the noble Baroness could explain the relationship between what was said then and what we are saying now.</p>

Let me say immediately that I was, and remain, a strong supporter of the legislation that brought about civil unions. However, I am concerned about effectively deceiving the child herself, or himself, on the birth certificate. The child will know that you cannot be the biological child of two parents of the same gender. Therefore, the child is bound to keep asking questions about who the father was. The issue is about the biological origin of the child.</p>

However, if a birth certificate does not reflect accurately what such certificates are about&#151;that is, a statement of biological

Because children, especially adolescents, seek the genealogical story of how they came to exist, we will, almost inevitably, not be bringing this issue to a peaceful outcome but making it very difficult.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07121296000066"></a>I also share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, about what will happen in some other cultures as people travel from place to place. If I may put it rather brutally, I share some concern about how the immigration services in our own country would deal with a child arriving with a birth certificate that, by the nature of things, could not be biologically accurate. I can imagine asylum-seeking children being rejected on the grounds that they could not possibly have two parents of the same gender.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07121296000067"></a>I am terribly troubled about this&#151;not because I have any prejudice against the matter, but about a legal acceptance of something that is not a fact suddenly becoming a fact because Parliament says so. We may recall that famous quotation that Parliament can, in its sovereignty, do everything except turn a man into a woman or a woman into a man. I therefore hope that the Government will take this back and look seriously at whether some device of the kind proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, could be adopted. We need to find some way out of what seems an almost impossible dilemma, and one that&#151;regardless of one&#146;s feelings about the Bill in other respects&#151;we should not accept.</p>

There is no contradiction between what was proposed on Monday about annotating birth certificates and today&#146;s debate. Ironically, the one group of children who would know that they were donor-conceived were those who had two mothers as parents. The deception, if one may call it that, is more likely to be perpetrated on children whose parents were heterosexual &#151;as, indeed, it has been since the 1990 Act, because we have had birth certificates stating that a man was the father of a child when he was not.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07121296000069"></a>A birth certificate is not a certificate of somebody&#146;s genetic identity. We do not have such a thing, and never have had. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and I disagree here, but it is a record of who a child&#146;s social parents are at any time. Therefore, since the passage of the Civil Partnership Act, it is possible for children to have two parents of the same sex. Those people take on the legal responsibility, social welfare responsibility, and all sorts of things, such as medical decision-making, which go on throughout the life of a child. That life is more important than the moment of their birth being recorded, which is why having an annotation of their family is important. They are a family; there are rights and responsibilities that go with having children.</p>

<a name="71212-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07121296000070"></a>It would be wrong to suggest to any child who was born into a family, and whose birth was planned, wanted and much desired by the two people constituting that family&#151;that is, the two people in the partnership&#151;that that was not so. It is not about trying to deceive people; on the contrary, it is a different kind of truth.</p>

The Government&#146;s position on today&#146;s amendment is absolutely firm. We think that the Bill should stand. I agreed to take back the amendment tabled the other day about whether there should be a symbol on a birth certificate for any child who was donor-conceived, whether they have same-sex or heterosexual parents.

A birth certificate is not a social record but a historical record. The social situation of children, the legal responsibility for them, and questions of their maintenance and upbringing are quite distinct issues. The birth certificate is a historical record that ought to be as accurate as possible, and should not be used to achieve ends other than the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07121296000073"></a>The child will have that certificate for his or her entire life. There will be questions raised as he or she grows older, and certainly when he or she needs to place it in the official domain, or to travel abroad. Everything that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, wishes to achieve can be, but by other parts of family law&#151;a subject that I used to teach. The custody of the child, making a will in its favour and so on can all be achieved. I am simply pleading for an understanding of family law, on the one hand, and the historical record on the other. If this is passed, it will be a glaring anomaly on the historical record for all time to come; for those who research their grandparents, for adults who reach 50, 70 or 90 yet who long since have not known who the second person named on their birth certificate might be. It is simply a plea not to include a deliberate biological lie on a birth certificate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07121296000081"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would remove from the Abortion Act 1967 the discrimination built into it whereby a baby with a disability can be aborted up to birth, while a 24-week limit is in place for babies without disability. The amendment would effectively act as a disability equality measure. For instance, a baby with a disability could not be aborted at a stage of pregnancy later than when the abortion of a baby without disability is prohibited. Sometimes this is described as creating a level playing field. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to remove in its entirety the section permitting abortion for disability. There is no other way to redress the discrimination in the Act.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07121296000082"></a>The amendment does not impact on any other sections in the Abortion Act, so that in all other respects abortion up to the current limit of 24 weeks would not be affected. In reality, this would mean that no abortion for disability could be performed after the 24-week abortion time limit. A woman receiving diagnosis of disability of the baby could still access abortion before the 24-week time limit under Section 1(1)(a), on the basis that continuing the pregnancy would involve risk of injury to the physical or mental health of herself or any existing children of the family. Abortion could not, however, be authorised on the basis of the baby&#146;s disability.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07121296000142"></a>(b) that the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; or</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07121296000087"></a>As I said at Second Reading, the present law has been abused, with the abortion of babies with such minor disabilities as cleft palate or club foot.

Surely something should be done now to put this injustice of aborting such babies right. How much pain does a developed baby feel in the womb? There are many aspects of life and death that we are not sure about. Have we become a society with anti-discrimination legislation that looks correct but in practice does not happen? The Bill before us has many complicated matters that are breaking new ground, but this discrimination against disabled babies could easily be rectified by accepting the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

Thus women are given the opportunity to obtain balanced information about the conditions and the experience of those living with the conditions and their carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07121296000093"></a>Importantly, the majority of women opt into the testing process. Research evidence shows that most women are in favour of antenatal testing and of having the option to end the pregnancy if a significant abnormality is diagnosed. In a large-scale study undertaken in 2002, only 5 per cent of women thought it was always wrong to have a termination of pregnancy,</p>

<p><a name="07121296000130"></a>Statistics show that the majority of women decide to end their pregnancy after the diagnosis of a condition that is &#147;incompatible with life&#148; or likely to lead to significant disability.</p>

ARC runs a national helpline and receives calls on a daily basis from parents who are considering or have had a termination of pregnancy after a diagnosis of a condition in their unborn baby. Although each parent&#146;s personal situation is different, a generic feature is how painful and distressing they find making the decision to end what is most often a much-wanted pregnancy. In ARC&#146;s experience, parents who undertake antenatal

Those who make that painful choice to end the pregnancy do so after careful consideration, advice and counselling of what the diagnosis may mean for their baby, the child&#146;s quality of life and what it might mean for themselves and their family&#146;s future.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07121296000095"></a>Removing foetal abnormality as grounds for abortion would particularly affect the reproductive choices of those parents who know they are carriers of a genetic disorder and risk having a baby with the condition. The Genetic Interest Group&#151;the national alliance of patient organisations which support children, families and individuals affected by genetic disorders&#151;believe that termination on the grounds of foetal abnormality should continue to be available.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07121296000096"></a>Very often we are told that we have laws in this country which do not exist in other European countries. An examination of other European countries shows that 25 out of the 27 members of the European Union enable women to end a pregnancy legally after a notice of foetal impairment. We should also take into account the general views of the public. A MORI poll in 2006 showed that the majority of the public support the availability of legal abortion in such circumstances.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07121296000097"></a>Some who advocate banning termination on the grounds of foetal abnormality may do so on the grounds that it is underpinned by eugenic principles. However, a eugenic policy demands public coercion. In ARC&#146;s experience, women are offered a termination after the diagnosis but clinicians are extremely wary of being directive, and it is left to the women to decide how she wants to proceed. That is very fundamental and very important. She will then make her decision about the future of her pregnancy based on her individual family circumstances and the knowledge she will live with the consequences of her decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07121296000099"></a>What is essential is that there must be the flexibility for women and parents to have the option to make their own reproductive choices. I therefore hope that this amendment will not be carried.</p>

If we were debating the subject, I would go into that in detail, but that strengthens my sense that, with huge respect for the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, this is not the moment, and I believe strongly that this is not the Bill, to get into this question, whatever arguments may be brought in about abortion from either side as amendments to the Bill in the other place.</p>

The complexity of the ethics and the decision-making, and the agony of people in making these decisions, should not be included in the Bill. They are important issues, and I concur with the calls for an ad hoc Select Committee of this House to be set up to look at the issues around abortion as we have had an Act in place now for 40 years. However, whichever way amendments are put down, whether in the same form as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, or in some other way, this Bill is not the place for us to make decisions and votes in the House on something that is deeply complex and needs in-depth analysis.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07121296000150"></a>&#147;A foetus of more than 24 weeks&#146; gestation is treated as having rights as a human being but loses those rights once it is diagnosed as being disabled&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121296000131"></a>The abortion of a foetus because of serious impairment is a complex issue, but that statement is the heart of the matter. It is the reason why the disability organisation RADAR has stated that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="07121296000151"></a>&#147;If the Government is serious in its aim to ensure equality for disabled people then the Abortion Act of 1967 must be amended to remove its discriminatory content&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121296000132"></a>It is the reason that disabled people, especially those with Down&#146;s syndrome, feel that their lives are devalued by the Abortion Act, and it is why I support the amendment.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07121296000104"></a>As a disabled woman and a feminist, Jenny Morris devotes a chapter of her book to arguing through the complexities of this issue. She suggests that the current law rests on three main strands of argument: that the baby&#146;s quality of life would be intolerable, that the disabled child would entail high personal cost to the parents, especially to the mother, and that the disabled child would be a drain on the country&#146;s resources. I shall take those in turn.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07121296000105"></a>With regard to judgment about the baby&#146;s quality of life being intolerable, none of us can judge whether another human being&#146;s life is worth living. We can only make that judgment about our own lives. As many severely disabled people will tell you, it is impossible for us to judge the quality of life of another person, truly to put yourself into their shoes, and it is not for the medical profession to do so either. &#147;Quality of life&#148; arguments are often a smokescreen for other motivations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07121296000106"></a>The second justification for the abortion of disabled foetuses after 24 weeks rests on the personal cost to the parents of bringing up the disabled child, as we

But how real is the choice that is presented to the potential mother? As Mencap points out in its policy on abortion,</p>
<ul><a name="07121296000158"></a>&#147;we believe there is a culture of prejudice among some health practitioners when a screening or test indicates that the unborn baby is likely to have a disability. Information presented to the woman about having a child with a disability is often negative and it is assumed she will have a termination&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121296000133"></a>It says there is growing evidence that doctors pressurise pregnant women to agree to the abortion of babies thought likely to have a disability.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07121296000107"></a>We live in a society that does not provide adequate resources to support disabled people in having equal opportunities. What is more, the parents are subject to the same preconceptions and prejudice about disability as most other non-disabled people. They would no doubt be horrified at the thought of becoming disabled themselves.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07121296000108"></a>Is this situation so very different from the situation of potential mothers in societies such as India or China where it is common for daughters to be completely devalued, with all the social and economic results that that entails? Yet we are appalled by, and rightly reject, any notion that a foetus should be aborted purely on the grounds that it is a girl.</p>

<a name="71212-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07121296000109"></a>The current law that allows for a termination right up to the full term of a pregnancy if there is a risk of serious handicap clearly demonstrates that the potential life of a disabled child is valued less highly than that of a non-disabled child. As Mencap points out, it means that any questions about when a foetus becomes a person or can feel pain are effectively disregarded in cases of disability. I agree with Jenny Morris&#146;s conclusion that once a foetus, disabled or non-disabled, has a viable life outside its mother&#146;s body, its rights as a human being are greater than its mother&#146;s right to refuse to give it birth. There can be no distinction between disabled and non-disabled foetuses. On the grounds of the equality of human life, I fully support the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07121296000111"></a>When contemplating this incredibly complicated ethical issue, I have been guided by two principles: first, the equal value of disabled and non-disabled people and, secondly, the rights of individuals to make informed and autonomous choices. I support a woman&#146;s right to end an unwanted pregnancy within the lawful period, currently 24 weeks. The option of a legal termination is central to women achieving social, economic, political and personal equality in today&#146;s society. However, I do not support the law that singles out impaired foetuses for abortion after 24 weeks. I believe that Section 1(1)(d) is inconsistent with disabled people&#146;s right to be viewed and valued equally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07121296000112"></a>The present time limit has been set because the consensus view is that after 24 weeks the foetus is viable&#151;that is, it would be likely to survive if born. We consider termination of a pregnancy after that time to be morally or ethically wrong&#151;unless, that is, prenatal diagnosis indicates disability. Then it is felt that abortion until term is both lawful and somehow acceptable. For me, that exemption confirms the outdated view that the potential life of a disabled child is of less value than that of a non-disabled child.</p>

It is a serious disability that requires assistance for the rest of your life&#148;. What they are saying in that one sentence is that my life somehow has less quality than theirs. This is not only hurtful, but it undermines my very humanity. Difference, my difference, disabled people&#146;s difference, is part of society&#146;s richness. To continue to single out potentially disabled people perpetuates the view that society would be better off without us. Surely, society should say that every child matters. Once a woman has decided to have a child, she and the world, should and can celebrate that life, whatever it turns out to be.</p>

A report by the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee makes instructive reading. Its key point is that, as policy makers, we are operating in something of a vacuum. In the first place, we need better data than we have at the moment about abortions that are carried out for foetal abnormality beyond 24 weeks. We need more information about the reasons for those abortions. The committee was told that there were inconsistencies around the country in the way in which the law is being interpreted and applied, which cannot be satisfactory, and that the position would be helped greatly by having greater guidance available for clinicians.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, was absolutely right: do we mean &#147;serious&#148; in terms of the foetus&#146;s viability; &#147;serious&#148; in terms of the disability that the child, if born, will have to live with; or &#147;serious&#148; in terms of the prospects of the disabled child being accepted and properly cared for?

The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, is someone whom I respect enormously and with whom I work on a range of other issues. I find myself in the uncomfortable position of disagreeing with her, but I do not think that she expected that I would do otherwise. She was right to pay tribute to the sincerity of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. I pay tribute to her sincerity as well. Those of us who come to the debate, even if we have different views, recognise and respect the fact that we hold those views with sincerity.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07121296000121"></a>I first came into this argument a long time ago. As some noble Lords will know, I introduced a Bill in another place in 1987 to reduce the upper time limit. Indeed, that Bill received its Second Reading with 296 votes, a majority of 45. It was talked out in the end, but it sought to reduce the time limit to 18 weeks. The EU average is about 13 weeks&#151;I say that in passing&#151;and I want to come back to one or two of the other statistical points referred to a moment ago by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that should inform our debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07121296000122"></a>The outcome of the 1987 Bill was that, when the 1990 legislation&#151;relevant to the Bill before the Committee tonight&#151;came before another place, it was agreed that there would be a vote on the upper time limit in the context of that Bill. It was then decided to reduce, from 28 to 24 weeks&#146; gestation, the upper time limit in most circumstances. An exception was made in the case of disability. In those circumstances, it was decided to increase the upper time limit all the way up to and even during birth, where disability was involved. I opposed that, but it was a decision that was taken in another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07121296000123"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, said that public opinion supported the retention of the law as it stands, but there is diverging evidence. We do not, in the end, make laws on the basis of opinion polls. However, I would just mention that, in May of this  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_309"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>year, ComRes carried out a poll showing that 55 per cent of people regarded the present law allowing abortion up to birth on grounds of disability as unacceptable. Another poll in May showed that 76 per cent of people, including 81 per cent of women, thought that abortion of a baby at six months&#146; pregnancy was cruel&#151;that was the word in the question. Sixty-eight per cent of people, including 72 per cent of women, wanted a substantial reduction in the upper time limit to around 13 weeks.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07121296000124"></a>There are clearly issues here, even if we disagree with one another, that deserve proper consideration. The noble Baroness is right to put these questions before us, as she did at Second Reading. In the previous Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, we saw the law changed in the way that I have described. The difficulty is that it is almost impossible for a private Member to change the abortion law because Bills are always talked out by either side. Unless it is done in the context of a government Bill, how else can legislation come forward? That is one of the issues that we cannot go on dodging. I hope that, if a Select Committee is created, it will look at that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="0712131000002"></a>When the 1990 provision was incorporated, I warned, on the advice of a renowned professor of law, Professor John Finnis at Oxford University, that the provision could in future be used to terminate pregnancies on grounds such as cleft palate. As my noble friend said, it is not widely known among most people that British law allows the abortion of disabled children right up to and even during birth, yet in 2006, 2,036 abortions were carried out under Section 1(1)(d) of the Abortion Act, which allows abortion up to birth if,</p>
<ul><a name="0712131000059"></a>&#147;there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712131000056"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made that point, which, too, is relevant in the context of this Bill, for the obvious reason that, only two days ago, we were discussing what we would do in the case of saviour siblings if &#147;serious&#148; were substituted for &#147;life threatening&#148; as a reason for removing organs from a child&#146;s body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="0712131000003"></a>Abortions carried out on disabled children represent just 1 per cent of the total number of abortions carried out in the United Kingdom, meaning that foetal disability is far from being the most common justification for termination of pregnancy&#151;99 per cent of abortions have nothing whatever to do with disability. If we as a society are truly committed to equality for disabled people, we cannot treat these disabled lives as mere statistics, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Chapman and Lady Wilkins, said. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, is right to raise this issue. Abortion for disability seems a small proportion of the total number of abortions only because the number of abortions is so very high, now running at 200,000 per year. As the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, recently said, that is too many. Six hundred abortions take place per day, 25 every hour. Those 2,000 disabled unborn children are not merely statistics; they are unique human individuals whose only opportunity to live has been denied. One academic has written that,</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_310"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="0712131000060"></a>&#147;each life is not an abstraction, it is a personal reality, one that exists only for one particular unborn human who will no longer be if abortion is chosen&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71212-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="0712131000004"></a>What conditions are being targeted? In 2006, 436 abortions were carried out on children with Down&#146;s syndrome, a chromosomal disorder. Twelve of those 436 abortions were performed after the 24-week time limit for social abortions. What are we saying as a society about the status of Down&#146;s children and adults? A further 129 unborn children were aborted because of &#147;selected cardiovascular anomalies&#148;&#151;that is, heart problems, about which the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, knows more than anybody not just in this Chamber, but probably in the country. One hundred and six unborn children were suffering from spina bifida. Other abortions for disability are carried out because of genetic disorders or bodily deformities. One of the most important points to note is that many of these conditions are not life-threatening. Just a few years ago, a young woman, the Reverend Joanna Jepson, fought a brave court battle to expose a case where an unborn child was aborted simply because he showed signs of having a cleft palate. Due to the vague and poorly defined wording of the 1990 Act, terminations for such minor, and easily treatable, conditions take place as a matter of course. Is it truly just or fair that we operate a kind of crude quality control over human beings, discarding them if they do not measure up to some arbitrary standard of physical perfection?</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="0712131000005"></a>Back in 1990, when abortion up to birth for disabled people was introduced, I was accused of scaremongering by others when I pointed out that the wording of the 1990 Act would allow for terminations for disabilities such as cleft palate. It was Harriet Harman, then a Back-Bench MP but now the Leader of the House of Commons, who suggested that Professor Finnis, and another eminent lawyer who was advising me at that time about the dangers inherent in the Bill, should be reported to the Law Society or Bar Council. Noble Lords should understand if in relation to so-called &#147;saviour siblings&#148; I express a degree of scepticism that the provisions in the Bill that extend the grounds on which organs and tissue can be taken from &#147;life threatening&#148; to &#147;serious&#148; will not lead to rampant abuse.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="0712131000006"></a>The right to life is surely the foundation of all other rights. There is of course another debate to be had about abortion in general, but abortion for disability raises particularly pressing issues to do with equality, diversity and discrimination. As the Disability Rights Commission noted some years ago, Section 1(1)(d) of the Abortion Act,</p>
<ul><a name="0712131000061"></a>&#147;is offensive to many people... it reinforces negative stereotypes of disability; and there is substantial support for the view that to permit terminations at any point during a pregnancy on the ground of risk of disability... is incompatible with valuing disability and non-disability equally&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712131000057"></a>The principle that people should not be discriminated against unfairly on grounds of race, gender and orientation is held dear by many in our society and, rightly, by many Members of your Lordships&#146; House. It has been enshrined in law in various ways during  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_311"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the past few decades. The womb, though, is one of the few places where disabled people are yet to achieve equality</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="0712131000007"></a>Raising disabled children is difficult, exhausting and sometimes demoralising&#151;I worked for several years with children with special needs before I was elected to another place. It can place a strain on relationships and change family dynamics in unsettling ways. Other children can feel neglected, as parents devote large amounts of time to caring for disabled siblings, yet it is still difficult to see abortion as a truly compassionate response in this situation. Is there perhaps a different model for how to care for disabled children, even those who are severely or terminally ill?</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="0712131000008"></a>I refer the Committee to the charity, Zoe&#146;s Place, which is a daughter charity of the charity, Life. Zöe&#146;s Place, of which I am a patron, is a baby hospice providing respite and palliative care for babies and young children from birth until the age of five. There are two Zöe&#146;s Places now, one in Liverpool and the other in Middlesbrough. Plans are well advanced to open another in the Midlands next year. Surely the answer lies in more hospices like Zöe&#146;s, providing more help and support to parents struggling to raise a disabled child.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="0712131000009"></a>The great danger is that if abortion, or post-natal infanticide of a disabled child, is allowed to become a treatment option, we start to decide that it can be in someone&#146;s best interest to be killed. This debate is, to a very large extent, a debate about the kind of culture in which we want to live, and the kind of medical culture in which we want doctors to operate. However compelling the case for ending the life of a badly disabled child, there is a very important principle at stake: we may not intentionally kill. Whatever the law, there will always be difficult cases and situations where individuals end up suffering. No one, of course, would wish to inflict or perpetuate suffering unnecessarily, but we need to accept that we cannot respond to suffering by killing the sufferer.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="0712131000010"></a>The medical imperative must always be to heal, to comfort and to preserve life. Standing in stark contrast to the counsel of despair is a well developed and venerable tradition in medicine that refuses to consider the intentional ending of a life as a treatment option. In years gone by the imperative to care and not to kill has led to the improvement of pain relief and new ways of making patients comfortable, rather than simply ending lives.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="0712131000011"></a>The amendment in my noble friend&#146;s name gives us a chance to proclaim a very important and profound message about the way we respond to suffering, imperfection, illness and the disabilities of our fellow human beings. It will be a clear and powerful statement to disabled people everywhere that we welcome them as full members of our community and society. Most importantly, it will preserve the lives of some of the most vulnerable human beings among us.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="0712131000012"></a>The law as it stands is, indeed, discriminatory. In the context of the possibilities of foetal surgery on conditions as different as cleft palate and spina bifida&#151;an issue that my noble friend and I raised with the Minister recently&#151;Parliament certainly needs to look at those questions and review this and  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_312"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column 312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other aspects of abortion law. The Minister will have seen the Question I tabled last week, asking for information on the availability of foetal surgery. I hope he will be able to speak to us at some length about these new possibilities, which may make redundant some of the debate we are having this evening.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="0712131000013"></a>Those advances in foetal surgery, the work of Professor Sunny Anand, who has highlighted the pain experienced by the unborn, and that of Professor Stuart Campbell, which has opened a vivid window into the womb, have completely changed the terms of this debate. I know my noble friend believes that if no way is found rigorously to examine all aspects of how the law currently works, then she, and perhaps others, will be left with no choice on Report but to test the opinion of the House. I hope that both sides in both Houses will look for a way to address the concerns of my noble friend. After 40 years, as my noble friend Baroness Finlay has said, it is surely time for a comprehensive review of all aspects of the abortion laws.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="0712131000014"></a>Following the letter which the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and I sent to the <I>Times</I>, I was very heartened to receive a number of letters. I will mention just one from Professor Peter Dunn, emeritus professor of perinatal medicine and child health, also signed by Professor Gordon Stirrat, emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology and senior research fellow in ethics in medicine. These are two of the leading authorities on this subject, who have been involved in these issues for the past 40 years. They said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="0712131000058"></a>&#147;We write in support of this suggestion published in your letter to the Times on 22 November. Both of us have been involved in the medical debate on this subject since the 1970s ... We hope that these contributions will be of help to you and we wish you every success in your endeavours&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712131000015"></a>They believe, as do many others, that it is time to look again at some of these questions.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="0712131000016"></a>The Liaison Committee will, on 8 January, consider a request from the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and myself, also supported by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. I know that it is supported by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and others. I was heartened to hear the remarks of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester in his earlier intervention. If it is modelled on the scrupulously fair and formidable committee which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, chaired, and which examined the equally contentious issue of assisted dying, perhaps it will provide an intelligent and thorough way of addressing questions like the one raised by my noble friend tonight.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0712131000017"></a>I am glad my noble friend tabled this amendment. I hope she will feel able to withdraw it tonight, after we hear assurances from the Minister that the arguments raised are powerful, deserve to be addressed and that we will find some way, before Report stage, to look at all the issues raised on both sides of this argument in a thorough way, which does not pit us unnecessarily against one another&#151;and certainly not in the context of this Bill.</p>

Some of us have not done so. I would simply like to ask the noble Lord to enable the House to be fully informed. He mentioned an opinion poll. Will he put before the Committee details of that poll with a full list of the questions and sample size and information about who commissioned and paid for the poll?</p>

<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="0712131000019"></a><b><a name="71212-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0712131000064"></a>Lord Alton of Liverpool:</b> I would be happy to answer that now. The poll was commissioned by the charity Life and carried out by professional polling organisation ComRes. I would also be happy to let the noble Baroness have a copy of the questions and the answers.</p>

<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="0712131000020"></a><b><a name="71212-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0712131000065"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I may surprise the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester, but I agree with him on the points he made today and, by implication, one he made in a previous debate. First, I think that he is absolutely right to say that we should not be using this Bill, at this time, to open up a debate about abortion. The noble Baroness may think that she can limit the debate to the issue of disability or equity between foetuses&#151;disabled or non-disabled&#151;at 24 weeks and thereafter. However, I can assure her that there will be plenty of other voices wanting to adjust the abortion law one way or another and it is a Pandora's box. I would strongly urge her not to go forward without having first the fullest discussion and effort at consensus building in both Houses based on research and scientific scrutiny. There should be Select Committee pre-legislative scrutiny and all the other things that we should properly have on a complex and difficult matter.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="0712131000021"></a>The second point on which I agree with the right reverend Prelate, which might be to his discomfiture, relates to when some of us were trying to suggest that there was an inconsistency in his attitude to children being adopted by a gay couple or single gay person as opposed to the right of those same individuals to seek IVF treatment, surrogacy or some other such treatment. The right reverend Prelate said that a real distinction should be made between fighting for the best possible outcome for a child who already exists and needed to be placed where they could have the best chance of a happy and well adjusted life&#151;and we all know that very often those children may be the ones who are hardest to place&#151;as opposed to knowingly bringing a child into this world into a relationship that he thought was inappropriate. I hope that I am not doing his position an injustice.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="0712131000022"></a>I think that the same thing applies here. I am confident that I can speak for my noble friend Lady Gould and I am certainly speaking for myself in believing that I would be shoulder-to-shoulder with any disabled person in this Chamber in fighting for the rights of disabled people, as I have sought to do all my life. But I make a distinction between that and the question of the status of the foetus&#151;I will not even say the unborn child. That can produce a conflict between the rights of that and the right of a woman to choose, when she may have the relevant

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="0712131000023"></a>Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Alton, I do not want to go into the detail of that argument tonight. Otherwise, I might be addressing the very issues that are not appropriate to this Bill. But on both of those grounds, I hope that the noble Baroness will not only withdraw her amendment tonight but will not come back in this way with amendments to address this topic. If we are to discuss this&#151;and I am sure that we shall be doing so&#151;our arguments should be based on the evidence that we do not have here tonight and we do not have as part of this Bill. It belongs appropriately in another form.</p>

<a name="0712131000024"></a><b><a name="71212-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0712131000066"></a>Baroness Williams of Crosby:</b> I pay tribute to the noble Baronesses, Lady Masham, Lady Wilkins and Lady Campbell, for the courageous way in which they have raised this issue. They have made all of us think very deeply about the issues that they talked about. I do not want to detain the Committee for more than a moment or two. Many of us feel&#151;and I share the view&#151;that we do not yet have all the information that we need to debate the topic seriously and to get the answer right. Those of us who have taken the line, from the right reverend Prelate to the rest of us, including the noble Lord, Lord Alton, have an absolute responsibility not to treat the issue of referring this to a Select Committee as a way of simply shelving the issue and delaying the outcome.</p>

<a name="71212-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="0712131000025"></a>Whatever side we may take on the issue that has been raised, we have a responsibility to the three noble Baronesses to ensure that the Select Committee reports in a reasonably rapid period of time and that the Government commit themselves to finding time for the matter to be discussed. We all know that without that commitment it is useless to talk about urgency and about a need for there to be a new discussion. If we ask the Government&#151;I would add my voice to those asking them&#151;to be willing to accept turning this over to a Select Committee, we should, in turn, take responsibility for that as a serious commitment, one that we will all commit ourselves to and one that we hope the Government will agree to find time to debate when the Select Committee has reported, so that the matter will not simply be put off to infinity, as it so often has been in the past.</p>

I thought that there was agreement from the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and others that we would not have a proper debate, because it was an inappropriate amendment to this Bill. In a way, it is an insult to the subject; it needs dealing with much more seriously on its own with other abortion issues. Whatever side of the arguments we are on, everyone has an opinion and wants to talk about it. Therefore, I thought that it was a little unfair of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who I always enjoy listening to, to make such a long speech when there was no one except the noble Baronesses, Lady Gould, Lady Hollis and myself from the other side of the argument&#151;the women&#146;s side.</p>

I have followed the debate today largely through my television set in my room. I ask the Committee in its deliberation on the Bill, which I accept is an important Bill, to have some regard to progress of business outside the Bill. There was scheduled for today a significant debate on European Union proposals in a particular policy area that has had to be rescheduled. I am afraid that there have been elements in the debate that I would describe as an indulgence. I am coming close to, but I want to avoid, the word &#147;abuse&#148;. I will not use it myself. There has been a repetition of argument and an unnecessary prolongation of the debate, which has meant that an issue for debate that was laid before the House for later tonight has been lost. Important as these issues are&#151;I recognise their importance&#151;it is incumbent on those who wish to participate in these debates, to recognise that there are other important issues that the House may wish to consider.</p>

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="0712131000028"></a><b><a name="71212-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0712131000069"></a>Lord Alton of Liverpool:</b> I do not entirely understand that intervention. This is the fourth Committee day of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. It is a highly complex and important Bill, and my noble friend&#146;s amendment is entirely in order. She raised the issue at Second Reading and participated in that debate. It would have not been accepted by the Clerks, if it were not in order. In Committee, we all have a right to contribute on amendments.</p>

<a name="71212-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="0712131000029"></a>We are trying to find a way forward that does not mean that there is the sort of debate that the noble Baroness said that she would not wish to see on Report. In that sense, the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and I are in agreement. As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said, we must find a way of dealing, in a constructive manner, with the powerful case made, which was far from repetitive. I thought that the three noble Baronesses who spoke did great justice to this. The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, put an alternative point of view, as she is entitled to do. Any Member of your Lordships' House is entitled to be present. Due notice had been given of the amendment; it appeared properly on the Marshalled List.</p>

<a name="71212-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="0712131000030"></a>I have made my own position clear&#151;that I would prefer these issues not to be raised in the context of the Bill, and would prefer to find another way to deal with them. However, I rigorously defend the right of my noble friend to table the amendment before your Lordships' House. That was how the disability clause came into law in the first place through the 1990 legislation and, unless a way is found to look at the matter again in the way described by others in Committee tonight, it will be inevitable that it will come back on Report&#151;and no doubt prolong our proceedings on another occasion, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="0712131000035"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in that we had three wonderful speeches from the noble Baronesses, Lady Masham, Lady Wilkins and Lady Campbell, and a clear and cogent argument for the other side from the noble Baroness, Lady Gould. However, I would like to address a couple of matters that, as a doctor, I feel that I have to.</p>

<a name="71212-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="0712131000036"></a>I was a junior doctor before the Abortion Act 1967, and remember delivering an anencephalic baby at term. That means that the child had no brain&#151;it had a face and a few skull bones&#151;and it lived for five minutes. The mother had known from an X-ray&#151;that is all that was available in those days&#151;that something was grossly wrong with her baby for weeks and weeks, and she had had to carry on with the pregnancy because there was no possibility of an abortion in those days. That is just as emotive and heart-breaking for that woman as any of the other things that we have heard tonight. When we talk about leaving the provision for serious handicap to be dealt with after 24 weeks if necessary, I think of that woman and child. That event was unforgettable, and it was not the only one. It was very severe, but others were almost as severe. You have to remember those cases, so you have to leave flexibility in the law for them to be dealt with.</p>

<a name="71212-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="0712131000037"></a>At the other end of the scale, we heard about a case of cleft palate; how outrageous it was is much bandied about. On looking it all up, I noticed that the Crown Prosecution Service did not prosecute. We do not know the details of the case. Cleft palate can be associated with some pretty gross abnormalities as well. We do not know; that may have been the case for that child.</p>

<a name="71212-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="0712131000038"></a>I think that we should leave the law as it is, but I agree that we should have a full and proper debate on all issues surrounding abortion. I would like to close by agreeing with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. In the end, it is a woman who has to be pregnant for nine months, go through childbirth and be primarily responsible for the child, whether it is disabled or not.

The logical thing is therefore that no one else stands up&#151;I realise that I am standing now. If no one else does, presumably the Minister will respond and it will be for the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, to determine how she responds to that.

The amendment tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Masham, Lady Wilkins and Lady Campbell, concerns abortion and, as we are all aware, that is a matter for Member&#146;s individual consciences. We have made it clear that amendments on this matter will be subject to a free vote. However, the Government have a role in administering what Parliament has decided to enact and with that comes the role of advising Parliament so that the Committee is fully aware of the implications of legislative proposals.</p>

<a name="71212-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="0712131000041"></a>The amendment would bring a fundamental change to the abortion legislation first passed in 1967 and amended in 1990, which covers England, Scotland and Wales. Many noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Steel&#151;who I understand have written to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, on the issue&#151;have suggested that a House of Lords Select Committee should be established to undertake a comprehensive review of abortion. The Government share the view of the Committee expressed today that there is value in debating moral and ethical issues such as abortion and benefits in addressing complex issues in Parliament. Noble Lords will appreciate that, ultimately, whether a Select Committee is established to review the existing policy on abortion is a matter for Parliament.</p>

<a name="71212-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="0712131000042"></a>On the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, about intrauterine surgery, it is absolutely correct that early scientific and technological innovation in this area shows promising early results and we should look at that more carefully in the future. I have set out the likely effects of this amendment, should it be accepted, and I hope that Members of the Committee will consider these points.</p>

It is not the fault of this amendment that we have sat so late. I apologise to all those who did not have any dinner, particularly those on the Front Bench. I do not feel at all guilty about tabling it. Many people outside this House are exceedingly worried about babies having to go full term. Perhaps I can tell the Committee what happens. After the lethal injection, babies can be squashed within the mother&#146;s womb before they are got out, which is horrible and revolting. It cannot be any good for anyone.</p>

I would go along with that, but this is such an urgent issue and a committee could delay matters, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said. That is my worry and I tabled the amendment so that it could be discussed and so that people will take more care.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121265000050"></a> Clause 17, page 17, line 10, leave out &#147;not&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000010"></a>The noble Lord said: A quality partnership approach would function in the intended way only if it is fair and reasonable to both bus operators and authorities. I am not certain that the clause in question gives a reasonable balance of power to both parties. I am afraid that this may lead to undermining the quality partnership approach. Clarity and transparency are needed to ensure that there is no ambiguity in this section.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000011"></a>The Bill states that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121265000051"></a>&#147;the revision of requirements as to frequencies, timings or maximum fares ... is not be to regarded as a variation of the scheme for the purposes of section 120&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121265000047"></a>While I can see that this has a legitimate application, I would be very grateful if the Minister could confirm whether the present drafting would allow an authority to change requirements pertaining to frequency, timings or maximum fares without an operator&#146;s consent.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000012"></a>We talked about admissible objections from relevant operators and what they may constitute. While I agree that the point needs clarification, I do not think that it is fair that an operator might have an unreasonably modified requirement imposed without any grounds for discussion or disagreement. For instance, if the maximum fare proposed by an authority is not agreed in the first instance, what is to prevent an authority from modifying the fare at a late stage unchallenged? I contend that at present the drafting is not sufficiently attractive to operators, bringing into question how many quality partnerships would be opposed at the earliest stage. The operator should have a mechanism for objecting if a material change is made after the scheme has commenced. Indeed, it is unclear what would happen to a quality partnership application after an admissible objection has been filed. Can the Minister please clarify that? The amendment seeks for all revisions to be regarded as a variation of a scheme under Section 120. I beg to move.</p>

We have had some discussions about having an extra session in Committee before Christmas, and I know that this has caused some difficulties. I want to thank colleagues for their forbearance on this. I hasten to add that it is not a problem that has been caused by my own side. I understand that there have been some difficulties&#151;</p>

I shall certainly do my bit to make sure that matters are kept as brief as possible. I want to record my thanks also to other colleagues who have played a part in this.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000016"></a>This is an interesting amendment, but not one that I ultimately find attractive. It raises some interesting points and subjects.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000017"></a>The effect is that every change in the requirements for frequencies, timings or maximum fares in a quality partnership scheme would need to go through an extensive consultation process. I understand that the noble Lord wants fair and reasonable treatment for operators; I understand that he seeks clarity and transparency. We seek a balanced approach. We certainly regard consultation as an excellent thing&#151;I have not heard many speeches against the value of consultation in my time in your Lordships' House&#151;but one has to have a sense of proportion. It is important to approach things in that way.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000018"></a>I see two problems with the approach adopted by the noble Lord. First, fares and frequencies are market-sensitive issues&#151;I am sure that the noble Lord appreciates that&#151;and a scheme is more likely to be acceptable in competition terms if there are provisions that allow such matters to be regularly reviewed, so that operators in the scheme are not bound to standards that may have been realistic at the outset but are not in the longer term, and so that new operators are not crowded out of the market by the high frequencies demanded of those in the scheme.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000019"></a>A regular review process&#151;perhaps once a year&#151;should be an integral part of the system. It should be agreed at the outset so that all the participants know exactly where they stand. That would not be compatible with going through the variation procedure with full public consultation. That could take almost a year to complete in itself. There is a danger that the process gets so cumbersome that there are not enough resources to put into the scheme and it would not then deliver its objectives.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000020"></a>A second concern is that if there is not the reassurance that any provision on frequency, timing and fares can be revised quite quickly and easily, operators are less likely to make the commitments in the first place and may well have admissible objections to doing so. All those factors are interrelated and we could easily upset the balance.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC115"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000021"></a>Bus operators will have to be fully engaged in the review process. It is perhaps worth reminding the Committee of the regulation-making powers that Clause 17 would insert into Section 122 of the Transport Act 2000. Those include, in paragraph (3)(c), a power to make provision,</p>
<ul><a name="07121265000053"></a>&#147;for any requirement as to frequencies, timings or maximum fares to be revised only if there are no admissible objections to the revision from relevant operators&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121265000048"></a>So it would be possible, under the provisions as drafted, to provide that such revisions could not take place without consulting relevant operators, without the need to impose the full, heavy-handed and perhaps sometimes overbearing consultation process in respect of such changes.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000022"></a>I hope that the noble Lord is satisfied on that point. I certainly understand his desire for greater clarity and transparency in these matters, but we need a sense of balance and proportion. I have a feeling that if the noble Lord were, in his own patch, to go along the route that he is recommending in the amendment, he could find himself rather bogged down and mired in consultation that could be never-ending.</p>

<p><a name="07121265000023"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07121265000060"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> No one wants to be bogged down in consultation that is never-ending. I repeat, as the Minister said, that we are looking for some clarification and transparency about the processes. We will read carefully what he said today to make certain whether we want to clarify the matter any further at a later stage but, with that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment today.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121265000052"></a> Clause 18, page 17, line 20, leave out subsection (2)</p>
</ul>
<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000029"></a>The noble Lord said: I am uncertain that quality contracts are the right approach for local transport authorities to adopt. It is all too easy to forget the problems with the regulated market and to assert that the London model provides a paradigm applicable&#151;or, indeed, affordable&#151;in all areas. The amendment seeks to remove revised proportionality criteria when setting up a quality contract, leaving the original with no other practical way for criteria to apply.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000030"></a>It should be borne in mind that there are currently no quality contracts anywhere in the country. The inference is that the nature of the scheme and the interim period before a functioning scheme can operate are not sufficiently attractive prospects for local authorities. Since there is currently no precedent, I contend that the one factor precluding the uptake of quality contracts is the legal uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the scheme. The Bill goes some way to streamlining the appeals process, but I am afraid that the time and resources required will remain an insurmountable barrier.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000031"></a>I have much confidence in the quality partnership approach, done properly and, with respect to both sides&#151;the consideration we have been talking about&#151;collaboration can produce excellent results. Can the Minister provide evidence to demonstrate the superior benefits of quality contracts over and above quality partnerships? After all, that is one of our aims.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000032"></a>An additional reason for removing this subsection is the ambiguity of some terms. Further to the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, at Second Reading, what, exactly, constitutes an economic, efficient and effective contribution to local transport policy? Furthermore, the lack of mention of financial compensation is likely to aggrieve bus operators. There is an argument that the loss of assets such as buses and depots without compensation is likely to cause operators to be opposed to a scheme from the outset. It should be remembered that not all the assets will necessarily be transportable. Urban vehicles such as articulated and double-decker buses would not be suitable for redeployment in a rural area. We therefore oppose the revised criteria for quality contracts. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121265000033"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121265000063"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> I want to ask the Minister briefly about the application of these quality contract schemes to Wales. In an otherwise extremely helpful note in the Explanatory Memorandum on the territorial applications of the Bill, there is no reference to Clause 18. Can we first clear up whether these quality contract schemes will apply and, if so, how they will be implemented and by whom? Secondly, what consultation has taken place, not only with Ministers in the National Assembly but also the National Assembly itself? I know a later clause is the subject of proper consultation, but these clauses have not been. I wonder if we can get some clarification as to the exact territorial extent and application of Clause 18 and the quality contract schemes.</p>

<p><a name="07121265000034"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121265000064"></a>Lord Snape:</b> I do not wish to detain the Committee by having a Second Reading debate on quality contracts and their necessity, but I ask the Minister what consideration has been given by the department to the question of compensation raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, if companies themselves lose certain routes, or parts of routes, because of a franchising scheme which would be the natural outcome of Clause 18. What consultation, if any, has taken place with shareholders in bus companies? Despite the generally held myth, they are not all Montecristo-smoking fat capitalists. Indeed, many of those working in the bus industry are shareholders in the company for which they work. I have already drawn your Lordships&#146; attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests, and do so again. Certainly, the two bus companies for which I have worked both have a considerable number of their employees as shareholders. In the National Express Group, accepting shares was actually a condition of employment. Obviously, any diminution of earnings for those companies arising from this clause about quality contracts will impinge on those shareholders and the employees as well, as many of them are one and the same. Will the Minister therefore address the point about compensation for shareholders and the impact of the franchising system in the clause on local bus services? Again, although it

I have no idea what the likely outcome of such an approach is&#151;I am glad to say that I am not a lawyer&#151;but one can envisage a fairly protracted and difficult situation arising in the circumstances that I have just outlined. I therefore hope that the Minister will spend some time on this point when he replies.</p>
<h5><a name="07121265000054"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000035"></a>Lastly, aside from my own interests in these matters, I believe that a partnership is a far superior method of operating bus services than a quality contract is. However, I appreciate that other people might have different views. Does the Minister agree that a quality contract, in most circumstances if not in all, really should be the court of last resort, and that, if all else fails, it is an avenue that should be explored if other aspects of bus operation have not been tried? I have no wish to repeat points that I made earlier in this debate, but your Lordships will be aware that I mentioned cases in which I have been involved when local authorities, for various reasons, were not prepared to participate wholeheartedly in the successful operation of quality partnerships. That is why, whether the blame lies with operators or with local authorities, I would be grateful if the Minister underlined the fact that, in his opinion and, I hope, that of the Government, the clause really will be the last resort and that everything else has been tried before quality contracts are applied in any area.</p>

It is rare indeed for us to hear any words in favour of what has become known as the &#147;only practicable way&#148; test. One must concede that at the outset. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, was right to remind us that, as yet, no one has gone down the quality contracts route.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000037"></a>One of the main objectives of the Government&#146;s policy document, <I>Putting Passengers First</I>, onwards has been to replace the &#147;only practicable way&#148; test with something that is more suitable yet still sufficiently exacting to ensure that quality contracts schemes are not made unadvisedly or without regard to the cost or the consequences. The noble Lord, Lord Snape, is right to pick up on some of those consequences. It is certainly right to understand them, and obviously we have endeavoured to do so. I assume from what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said that the main purpose and drift of his amendment is in essence to preserve the status quo&#151;I think that that is where he is coming from&#151;where quality contracts schemes are a theoretical possibility but bus operators are pretty confident that they will never be used. The noble Lord, Lord Snape, reminded me that when, back in 2000, Ministers described quality contracts schemes as a last resort, they assumed that they would be an option that could be resorted to in the right circumstances. We  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have moved on from that experience, and the experience of the past few years suggests that even that may have been a touch overoptimistic. For various reasons, even the local transport authorities that are convinced that only a quality contracts scheme can deliver the improvements in bus services that the public rightly demand are daunted by the task of proving that there is absolutely no other practicable way of making those improvements. Probably, on reflection, the &#147;only practicable way&#148; test is somewhat odd in other ways. In theory at least a local transport authority could develop a policy that by its very nature could be implemented only through a quality contracts scheme. A uniform fare structure across the whole area of the authority might be an example. That could never be achieved in a deregulated market or even under a quality partnership scheme. Perhaps it is worth noting that only maximum fares and not the actual fare could be specified under the amendments proposed in Clause 12&#151;at least not without blatant breach of competition legislation. So, on the face of things, the &#147;only practicable way&#148; test could be passed by an authority whose public interest case did not have much merit.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000038"></a>Rather than relying on that test, Clause 18 will substitute a series of positive criteria that a proposed scheme will have to satisfy, and against which it can be measured when a decision is needed on whether to keep it in force. Without these criteria, against which an independent approvals board can check and evaluate a scheme, much else in this part of the Bill would not work as intended. The additional requirements on consultation and affordability in Clause 19, which we shall come to shortly, would make the whole procedure even more daunting than it is at present.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000039"></a>I come close to agreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Snape, in his assertion that we see this very much as an approach of last resort. There may be occasions when it is deemed a sensible approach when all else has failed and when a quality contract&#151;a quality partnership&#151;clearly is not delivering the goods. We need to increase bus patronage and usage. If that is not happening in a particular area, the provisions set out in Clause 18 on quality contracts schemes would be the right approach. I know that there is some enthusiasm for that approach, and understandably so.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Snape, asked about consultation with operator shareholders. I understand where the noble Lord is coming from. We have had several consultations with bus companies, which have been very responsive in telling us exactly what they thought. It is only fair to say that bus companies and their shareholders&#146; interests will be very much aligned. The noble Lord also asked me about compensation, which has been raised forcefully by bus operators in response to consultation on the draft Bill. In the end we cannot accept their arguments. A quality contracts scheme will not deprive operators of their assets&#151;primarily the buses themselves. Of course, they would be free to deploy them elsewhere on a network that they operate if they do not wish to tender for quality contracts, or fail to win any tenders. Of course, the buses themselves will retain a substantial value if the companies ultimately had to dispose of assets. The same applies to land holdings and depots, which might become surplus to an operator&#146;s requirements.</p>

<p><a name="07121265000041"></a>The provisions in Clause 18 mean that a local transport authority would need to satisfy fairly exacting criteria to get a scheme approved. There is still agreement on that point, and that would include a proportionality test. That test is an important protection. Any adverse affect on operators&#146; businesses would need to be proportionate to the increase in public benefit from achieving the objectives of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="07121265000042"></a>I am sure that Members of the Committee will be aware that the department has published a draft of its proposed guidance for local authorities, which should assist them in understanding how to apply the proportionality test, and encourage them to ensure that all operators have a fair opportunity to compete for quality contracts in the areas affected.</p>

<p><a name="07121265000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, asked about the application of this part of the Bill to Wales. Local authorities in Wales can make a quality contracts scheme at present and still will be able to do so. But, unlike the operation of the scheme in England, Welsh Ministers will continue to approve the schemes as now. In a sense, that it is not a particularly relevant consideration. New criteria will apply in Wales, as in England.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121265000044"></a>I understand where the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is coming from on this. I am confident that we will make nearly all the progress that we want to make through the quality partnership route, which is the major thrust of government policy. There may be occasions when the quality contract route, because all else has failed and because of local circumstances, ends up being embarked upon. But there are important tests and protections in place to ensure that that approach will be proportionate and appropriate, with each party understanding their part.</p>

I am grateful to him for what he said. Many people on both sides of this argument in the bus industry would be grateful for clarification on how he sees the way forward. I caution him on two matters. I do not mean to be insulting, but the Minister rather brushed aside what happens to companies&#146; assets&#151;I shall come to compensation in a moment. He implied that vehicles can always be deployed if a company loses a contract or a franchising system is introduced, but that is not always the case.</p>

<p><a name="07121268000002"></a>I have bored Members of the Committee before on bendy buses in Birmingham and I do not wish to do so again. But they were bought specifically for one route. Usually, it is operators who are condemned for  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reneging on discussions. In this case it was one of the highway authorities. I do not want to cause too much grief to the Liberal party, but they were part of this decision. However, a particular bus lane was removed and, in a city such as Birmingham, it is very difficult to imagine bendy buses being deployed on many routes. The city does not lend itself to the use of those vehicles. Some Members of the Committee might feel that no city does.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000003"></a>However, Travel West Midlands, the company I worked for at the time, consulted bus passengers about the introduction of bendy buses. They prove to be surprisingly popular for women passengers who feel safer on a bendy bus with a television screen and being able to see the driver in front than they feel on a conventional double-decker bus, which is one reason why they were introduced on this route. But they are not readily deployed elsewhere, as the Minister glibly&#151;I do not mean that in any insulting way&#151;implied. Birmingham is not a city that lends itself to the deployment of these vehicles. If they were not used on that route, there would be a great operational problem as to where else they could be used.</p>

<p><a name="07121268000004"></a>As regards property, in my experience, many bus garages are in attractive areas of the city. I readily concede that they not particularly attractive buildings and often are not seen as good neighbours. A company of which I was chairman at the time had a garage at Quinton, a suburb of Birmingham, which was subject to lots of complaints about early morning and late night bus operation. All of us who care about public transport like to see it operating for as many hours as possible, but the neighbours of a bus garage might take the opposite view.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000005"></a>Eventually, because there were so many complaints, the planning authority held that the company was in breach of its planning permission and wanted to restrict the hours we worked. The company concerned succumbed to the blandishments of a supermarket chain, moved the buses out and sold the property at a rather decent price, as far as the shareholders were concerned, to the supermarket chain. I understand that the neighbours are not particularly happy at having noisy buses being replaced by shoppers seven days a week, some of whom are less than careful about where they park their car in the immediate area.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000006"></a>Going back to what my noble friend said, it is easy to say that it is possible to dispose of the assets. That disposal is not necessarily what the immediate neighbours might like. It is difficult to imagine in a competitive world and a competitive industry such as the bus industry that a bus company losing an area to a franchise system under this clause would readily dispose of its assets&#151;whether land, property or buses&#151;to what is seen as a rival competitor. It may decide to sell to the highest bidder to the detriment of the amenities of the neighbourhood.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000007"></a>I do not expect my noble friend to give me a comprehensive answer on those two examples. Without sounding smug or complacent, I hope I have indicated to him that this is what happens in reality when one gets involved in these matters rather than when reading a brief which has been prepared by someone else.</p>

I take the point. This example operates outside the framework that we are proposing in legislation. The point on bendy buses is good. I agree that they are a good vehicle on the right route. They have proved to be surprisingly popular in some areas for the very reasons that my noble friend raised.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000009"></a>Similarly, I understand the pain that can occur when you have to dispose of an asset. I have been in a local authority and I have had to dispose of assets. We caused problems and we rubbed up against other interests. However, the proportionality test would bear very heavily on the decision-makers involved in quality contracts. Those very considerations are precisely why that proportionality test is there and why it has value. I understand and accept that that is not a complete answer to my noble friend&#146;s point. I know that there is a sharp division of opinion about whether we should build forms of compensation into this. I do not think that we can go down that route, but I think that the proportionality test probably offers what the noble Lord is seeking. I hope that that issue will be highlighted during our debates. I certainly respect the point made by the noble Lord.</p>

I do not think that we will pursue this much more today. I am a great believer in partnership and I think that quality partnerships could be improved to be the main answer. I do not know how people will take up quality contracts, but I am sure that we will pursue this debate further on Report. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07121268000013"></a>The noble Lord said: I should like to continue the debate on quality contracts now rather than wait for Report stage. Amendment No. 24 would fundamentally change the Bill so that the local transport authority is the body that takes the decision on whether a quality contract scheme should be approved or made. If an operator believes that the decision of the local transport authority has breached its human rights, or unfairly or unreasonably prevented it from continuing to trade either completely or in part, or is not in accordance with the Bill&#146;s guidelines, they have a right to seek to pursue the matter through the courts.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000014"></a>We do not want to end up with the situation in which we found ourselves following the Transport Act 2000, which provided, as we know, in theory for statutory quality partnerships and quality contracts. But, in practice, the requirements, the procedures and the criteria set out in that Act meant that those provisions were little used. As I understand it, there is only statutory quality partnership in place in England and no quality contracts anywhere in England, so it does not suggest that the Transport Act 2000 has been particularly a howling success.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000015"></a>We do not want to end up making the same mistakes again, but the Bill looks likely to achieve that feat. With the right of a veto by an operator on frequencies, timings and maximum fares in a quality partnership, a local transport authority may well take the view that it is not in a significantly stronger position than it is now, where, in return for providing improved infrastructure, it essentially gets some potential improvements in vehicle quality. Hence this Bill will not result in any significant increase in the number of statutory quality partnerships, although it probably would have done before the Government gave bus operators an effective veto on frequencies, timings and maximum fares; hence the importance of quality contracts.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000016"></a>However, as the Bill stands, with the apparent time-consuming and costly procedures involved in securing a quality contract, it is unlikely that more than one or two of even the largest transport authorities will think it worth the cost, hassle and uncertainty of going through the extended quality contact procedure. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked precisely that question, and did not get a very informative answer when he asked how many authorities were likely to be interested in going down that particular road.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000017"></a>Indeed, it seems odd that the Bill on the one hand expands the existing duty of local transport authorities to develop policies relating to transport so that they must cover all aspects of transport, and take protection and improvement of the environment into account, and on the other says, &#147;Even though we deem you capable of carrying out this major function, we do not trust you to look after the interests of the public you serve over issues such as frequencies, timings and fares, so we are going to bring in other bodies, such as the Approval Board and Transport Tribunal, to decide what you&#146;re going to be allowed to do to bus services&#148;. To believe that a local transport authority is going to put its bus operator or operators out of business through unreasonable schemes and then be left trying to explain to its electorate why bus services upon which they depend are no longer running is, frankly, extraordinary. The only recent example of which I can think of an attempt to put a bus company off the road is the highly questionable methods of Stagecoach to overcome the local bus operator in Preston. Needless to say, Stagecoach is among the strongest opponents of the Bill&#146;s proposals, which would put an end to that kind of activity if only the Government would facilitate rather than impede their implementation.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000018"></a>However&#151;my noble friend Lord Snape hinted at one example&#151;maybe the Minister has examples of local transport authorities that have sought, like Stagecoach, to use questionable measures to put bus operators off the road. If so, I ask him to give the details when he responds.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000019"></a>The quality contracts procedure is in marked contrast to the Bill&#146;s provisions in relation to local road user charging schemes where decisions are to be made by local authorities, even though there will no doubt be some who say, as some bus operators claim will be the situation with quality partnerships or contracts, that a road user charging scheme would either put them out of business or adversely affect the finances of their business.</p>

<p><a name="07121268000020"></a>In line with the question of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I again ask what evidence my noble friend has that local transport authorities will think it worth going through the quality contract procedure. How long does my noble friend think the procedure will take? First, as I understand it&#151;I am quite happy to be corrected&#151;there will presumably have been an attempt to make a quality partnership scheme in most circumstances. There will have been a veto on frequencies and timings by one or more bus operators. The matter will have gone to the traffic commissioners to consider. It is not clear whether they simply uphold or dismiss the objection, or whether they can amend the local transport authority&#146;s partnership scheme. If they can amend it, could there then be further admissible objections by either the original parties involved in the application or a new party who claims who be affected by the amended scheme? That could lead to even more delay?</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000021"></a>Will a party involved be able to appeal to either the transport tribunal or the courts against a decision by the traffic commissioners on a quality partnership scheme and, if so, on what grounds? If a party can make a further appeal in this way, that will be even more delay, and we have not even started on the quality contracts process. Again, can my noble friend say if it will be possible to go straight to a quality contract process only in certain limited circumstances without first having tried the quality partnership route? If so, can he reiterate under what circumstances that would be, where it would not be in danger of having the quality contract thrown out on the basis that a quality partnership would have achieved the same objectives?</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000022"></a>The quality contracts scheme appears to be the franchising of a network of services similar to the arrangements for bus services in London and rail services nationally, except that for London&#146;s bus services and the national rail network, there appears to be no equivalent of the procedure set out in the Bill for bus services outside London. A local transport authority submits an application for a quality contracts scheme to the Approvals Board shared by a traffic commissioner. The board considers it, presumably with public hearings&#151;I am sure that the Minister will put me right if I am wrong&#151;and decides either to accept or to reject the scheme, or perhaps to approve it as amended in whichever way it thinks fit. Will the Minister confirm whether my understanding is right?</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000023"></a>There will then be a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal on any matter as of right. The Transport Tribunal will then make arrangements for a hearing, hear the appeal, and take a decision. Will the Minister say when he responds whether the Transport Tribunal may amend the quality contracts scheme or simply uphold or dismiss the appeal? Will he also say whether the Approvals Board may amend a local transport authority&#146;s partnership scheme? Will he also say whether a party that did not wish to challenge the original scheme but wanted to challenge the Approvals Board&#146;s amended scheme could do so, and whether that would mean another hearing by the Approvals Board into representations by a new party into its amended scheme or an appeal to the Transport Tribunal?</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000024"></a>Would a bus operator have to disclose to the local transport authority concerned all information that it put in front of the Approvals Board and the Transport Tribunal in support of its case, including financial information? Would that information also be made public? I understand that, once the Transport Tribunal has taken a decision, there can then be an appeal to the courts. Will the Minister say on what grounds an appeal can be made? If it can be made on the grounds that the decision by the tribunal was unreasonable or did not give proper weight to certain evidence, presumably the case would in effect be re-run in front of the appropriate court. We should be under no illusions that, if a local transport authority decided to go down the road of the quality contracts scheme, the bus operators would resist it all the way if the Approvals Board and Transport Tribunal decisions were not to their liking. The views of the bus operators are on the record, and they do not seem to be keen on seeing anything akin to the London arrangements for buses being extended elsewhere. A lengthy process could lead to other difficulties for a local transport authority. Existing operators who had not tendered for a quality contract or who had been unsuccessful would have little incentive to improve or even to maintain their services in the area concerned. Existing users might move to alternative forms of transport, including the car, probably contrary to the local transport authority&#146;s own transport strategies and plans.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000025"></a>Will the Minister, in response to the questions that I have already asked, say how long the Government intend or believe this procedure could take? If, in the normal course of events, the quality partnership route would have been expected to have been traversed before the road of the quality contracts scheme was embarked on, I hope that his view on the time involved will reflect that fact and will include an appropriate period for a local transport authority to draw up and consult on its proposals. If it managed to jump all the hurdles, I hope that it would have an appropriate period to implement those proposals. Will the Minister also say how much the Government anticipate it will cost a party to go through this procedure in full?</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000026"></a>The amendments also give rise to the question of who should be the key player in determining the frequency and timings of services and fare levels. Those decisions are crucial in determining transport plans and policies that are in the best interests of the communities concerned.</p>

<p><a name="07121268000027"></a>Clearly, an affected party has a fundamental right to go to law and pursue through the courts any injustice, unfairness, human rights breach or illegality felt to have resulted from a decision of a local transport authority. That decision would have to have been made after proper consultation and right-to-state-your-case procedures, set out in the Transport Act 2000. The issue is why we need all the other procedures and processes as well. The members of a local transport authority may have fought their successful election campaigns on pledges to deliver improved bus services. Is the will of the electorate to be turned over by an unelected approvals board or a transport tribunal? Does my noble friend think that the London system of

<p><a name="07121268000028"></a>If the real problem is the first stage of getting from an unregulated to a regulated market, we will not get through it if we have a process and a procedure that will, in my view, deter nearly all local transport authorities&#151;I sense that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, probably agrees&#151;from going down the road of quality contract schemes. We are in real danger of finding that this Bill will give birth to the same number of quality contract schemes as the Transport Act 2000&#151;none&#151;and it will not be because large numbers of quality partnership schemes covering fares, timings and frequencies are being concluded, thus negating the need for quality contracts. It will be because the procedure is designed, no doubt unintentionally, to thwart rather than to encourage progress and the extension of the democratic process into the provision of bus services for the community. I beg to move.</p>

This is the second time that we have tried to amend the disastrous deregulation of 1986. Looking round the Room, I think that I am perhaps the only one here today who sat in this Room eight years ago when we considered the Bill that became the Transport Act 2000. It was a failure, as my noble friend said. It did not give local authorities enough power to influence what went on on the ground, so we continued to have the bus wars that he described in Preston. Preston is not the only place affected; it happened in Manchester slightly earlier.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000030"></a>Why has the 2000 Act not worked? In response to an earlier question from the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, my noble friend the Minister used the words, &#147;cumbersome and complicated&#148;. As my noble friend described, the implementation of quality contracts under this system is cumbersome, complicated and costly.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000031"></a>I believe that partnerships are the best way forward, but local authorities should have a real alternative, because of the suspicion and the problems between local authorities and bus operators. I am not necessarily taking sides; it is always one problem, but we must admit that there are problems. A partnership will not work if there are not two willing parties to it. The local authorities should defend the interests of the public, as my noble friend said. That is their role in their area. If we are to achieve our goal of sustainability, that must include both defending the interests of existing passengers, who tend to be from the poorest and most deprived parts of the community and who rely on bus services because they have no access to any other form of transport, and encouraging more of us to leave the car at home and get on to a bus system that works for that community. I am not sure that bus companies are able to operate in those interests.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000032"></a>The deregulation was meant to create an effective network through competition, but it is a funny form of competition. In Manchester, a single local authority  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>operator has been largely replaced by two private operators who operate north and south. There are two monopolies covering slightly different geographical areas. The situation seems to be similar in most areas.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000033"></a>I thought that one of the factors of competition was risk, yet we are talking about compensating people who are not able to win a contract in a marketplace. In what other areas would we be talking about public compensation for people who have lost business? If they want to go into a bus service business that involves competition, they have to accept the risk. Local authorities have a right to use their own assets as they want and we have to use the planning laws in a fair and proper manner to ensure that they do not do so in any way that affects the public.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000034"></a>Most bus operators rely heavily on public subsidy&#151;the money from local authorities that enables them to subsidise pensioners and non-commercial routes. My colleagues on the Greater Manchester passenger transport authorities never feel that there is an open book arrangement on the amount of money that goes from local authorities to bus companies. Their level of risk is mitigated by public subsidy.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000035"></a>I hope that the Minister has listened carefully. My noble friend Lord Rosser asked him a large number of questions and he will need to think about the responses. We are saying that we should not do what we did in 2000, when we tried to change the disaster of 1986, but did not achieve it. If we make it too difficult for local authorities to have a quality contracts system, this will be another failed transport Bill.</p>

It seems like only yesterday. It is a matter of record&#151;this is the great benefit of <I>Hansard</I>&#151;that I said at some length that without fares and frequencies in quality partnerships, you would not achieve anything in a statutory quality partnership that you could not do with a voluntary one. That has proved to be the case. The many successful quality partnerships are, with one exception, all voluntary. I also recall saying at the time that the test for introducing quality contracts was so stringent that no one would bring them in. That has proved to be the case.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000037"></a>I make those points partly to remind myself and be smug about it, because it is always nice to say I told you so. More usefully, I urge the Government not to carry on in the same way when something clearly has not delivered what they were hoping for in 2000. The stated aims have not been achieved.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000038"></a>I have a lot of sympathy with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on the previous group of amendments. I would prefer voluntary arrangements. However, if we make quality contracts impossible&#151;I would prefer that they were not used on the whole, if possible&#151;the noble Lord should consider what might happen in areas that are seriously considering the introduction of road user charging. That really worries me, because it transforms the landscape in a way that we have not understood before. In London, the only reason that the Mayor could even consider introducing a congestion charge was that he was controlling public transport. If the Government really believe that there are local authority areas that need to introduce road  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>user charging to manage congestion, giving them the option of a quality contract may be the only way in which they can introduce it. Otherwise, the local authority will be charging citizens for something that they previously enjoyed, but will not be able to guarantee the improvements in public transport that citizens will expect to be part of the deal. The Government need to think very carefully about the relationship between the two. If they are not prepared to make quality contracts useable and capable of being developed, they probably ought not to expect road user charging.</p>

<p><a name="07121268000039"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07121268000070"></a>Lord Snape:</b> I found the contributions of both my noble friends interesting&#151;not 100 per cent accurate, but interesting. My noble friend Lord Smith said that he was the only Member of the Committee who was around at the time of the Transport Act 2000. He was immediately contradicted by the noble Baroness opposite, so he was wrong there. The same debate took place down the Corridor and I was involved in it then.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000040"></a>My noble friend is right that some of the fears expressed at the time of the passage of that Act have been realised, especially the fear that local authorities would not get their hands on what were their assets. Understandably, many local authorities wish to turn the clock back to pre-1986, but that is not possible. We are not going back there, and I am sure that my noble friend would agree with that. He said that he regretted the fact that the London arrangement for buses does not appertain countrywide. That view is widely shared by many local authorities. That is not perhaps surprising when one looks at the cost of the London system of bus regulation. The figures for the support of bus services in London have increased by more than 200 per cent, compared with the last full year before deregulation, which I think was 1985, and by 1,700 per cent since 1995-96. That increase continues to pile on year on year because of the policies followed by the current Mayor of London and Transport for London.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000041"></a>I am making no criticism, but I cannot imagine any Government of any political hue having the ability&#151;or the inclination&#151;to spend that sort of money countrywide. We have to accept that London is a different market from the rest of the country. My noble friend shakes his head, but he will have to accept that it is the capital city and that that is because of congestion, I presume&#151;I am not saying that other cities, including Wigan, do not have a degree of congestion, but that their congestion is nothing like it is in London. I understand why no Government of any political hue will follow that example&#151;certainly financially.</p>

I am afraid that the Committee will have to put up with this spat between the two of us. Whether the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, were aimed at me or not, I did not find them particularly new. That view has been held by local authorities for many years&#151;certainly since the passage of the Transport Act 2000.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000049"></a>As my noble friend Lord Smith of Leigh said, it is a question of partnership, but it is not always the bus operators who fail to implement partnerships. I have a couple of examples involving not so much local authorities, although they are involved as well, but when Passenger Transport Authority executives&#151;the elected element&#151;have not followed through. Sometimes that is because of change in the political control of PTAs, of which Birmingham is a fine example&#151;or perhaps not so fine an example&#151;of the sort of situation that I am outlining. Because of the change in political control, the money to the constituent authorities and policies are seen through a different prism.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000050"></a>Despite agreements being made at PTA level, because the district councils are themselves the highway authorities responsible for implementing some of those agreements entered into at a different level, such agreements have not been implemented; indeed, they have been countermanded. There are examples of failure on both sides since the passage of the Transport Act 2000; I am sure that my noble friend will accept that.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000051"></a>Taking the example of the bus industry&#151;I hesitate to start quoting my own experience once again, but I shall do so. I served on a passenger transport authority in greater Manchester in the early 1970s as an elected councillor. It was then known by the long-winded name of south-east Lancashire and north-east Cheshire PTA. I do not think that any bus passenger would have said at the time that the services that we ran were quite as comprehensive and as rosy as those that both my noble friends seem to feel would be run if only the local authorities had a greater part to play once more.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000052"></a>On Second Reading and during our discussion on an earlier amendment, I pointed out to noble Lords that the biggest survey of bus passengers carried out by my noble friend&#146;s department indicates that outside London something like 83 per cent of bus passengers are content or reasonably content with the services provided by the &#147;wicked capitalists&#148;&#151;if I might put that phrase in inverted commas&#151;whereas, despite that increase of 1,600 per cent, only 78 per cent of passengers in London are satisfied with the socialist paradise provided by Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London. That does not indicate&#151;although these surveys are not 100 per cent accurate&#151;that there is massive happiness with the situation in London. As a regular bus user in London, I am very impressed by the system, but  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC129"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether I would be impressed enough to fork out the money that I am going to be asked for as an occasional council tax payer in London remains to be seen. The bus services are far superior to those before the mid-1990s.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000053"></a>My noble friend Lord Rosser felt that there should be no independent approval for quality contracts and gave his reasons why. Again, it is a strange system where one side makes one proposal, another side makes a counterproposal and the side that made the first proposal then says that they are going ahead anyway. There has got to be some fallback position and some independent element that makes that decision. Having met quite a few of them, I am more than happy that the traffic commissioner, some of his staff and other people participate in this decision-making process. Traffic commissioners, by and large, are pretty under-resourced and I hope that if they are going to play this role my noble friend will tell us that there will be much greater resources passed in their direction. Most people in the bus industry would agree that if anyone is capable of making an independent decision on a quality contract or some other controversial aspect of such a scheme, a body chaired by the traffic commissioners is as good as any that I can think of; although I would be interested if the Minister can think of another.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000054"></a>I will paraphrase what my noble friend who replied from the Front Bench said on Second Reading when this point was debated. He felt it was important that an independent assessor looked at these matters before this decision was made. My noble friend Lord Rosser talked about people seeking compensation. Again, I have no wish to add to the so many guineas a word that our learned friends in the legal profession make out of these matters, but it is an inevitable consequence of the quality contracts scheme that someone who loses out will seek some sort of reparation. I am not saying that that is right, sensible or a course of action that I would advocate. But it seems to me that someone would seek some sort of judicial review if they lost out under the terms of this clause.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000055"></a>I return to the point that it needs two to tango and that once they make agreements both sides should stick to them. It has been a justified long-time criticism by local authorities that they had to provide the resources&#151;the highways and the bus priority measures for the private sector which operated the buses&#151;and yet the private sector benefited financially from that provision, in some cases enormously.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000056"></a>In the West Midlands, we, as the major bus operator at that time, sat down with the passenger transport executive to try to agree some system of payment that we as the bus operator could make for the provision of those facilities, because we thought that that was fair, since we were going to benefit from them. We agreed a sum of up to &#163;30 million over a number of years in part-funding. If the executive paid 50 per cent of the cost of the highway arrangements, Travel West Midlands, the bus company that I chaired at the time, would pay the other 50 per cent. After five years in the job, when, somewhat wearied and feeling the strains of old age, I stepped down as chairman, the bus company had spent about &#163;300,000, because getting these schemes to come to fruition was enormously difficult. Despite  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the best wishes of the Passenger Transport Authority, highways authorities&#151;again perhaps because of a change of political control&#151;were all too often not very keen on bus priority measures in their area. I left in 2000, but even now, nearly eight years later, the National Express Group, the last time I checked, spent no more than &#163;1 million on these facilities because of the nature of getting agreement with the highways authorities and the PTA that were implementing these schemes. It is not a question solely of private bus operators failing to deliver; there are weaknesses on both sides.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000057"></a>I have to say to my noble friends that, without the benefit of a brief provided by someone else, local authorities are not good at taking quick decisions or implementing them. I am sure that one of the reasons why the previous Prime Minister wanted to change the system of local government in this country was that he felt equally frustrated. That is not an attack on councillors&#151;I was one myself&#151;but the system these days does not lend itself to quick commercial decision-taking.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000058"></a>I apologise for detaining the Committee for so long, but that leads me to my last point. It is important that an independent element rules on these decisions, although I do not encourage private operators to go to court. I do understand the fears expressed by many local authorities that the bus services are not as comprehensive as they could be if they had a greater say, but services and fares in many areas are discussed by both sides in this community. It is for the private operator, who after all invests a considerable amount of money in a bus fleet, to take the final decision as to how its assets are deployed. That is how private operators see it, and it is very difficult to argue with that. As for the point that councillors make pledges which independent approvals boards overturn&#151;a sentence that I wrote down as the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said it&#151;many local authorities would be quite glad when they make these pledges that someone else has to say yea or nay. It is easy to make pledges when seeking election at any level&#151;those of us who have sought election have all been tempted to make pledges in certain areas&#151;but it is not always easy to implement them afterwards, and the fact that there is an independent body that can decide whether those pledges should be implemented might be somewhat welcome, whatever councillors might say publicly.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121268000059"></a>My very last point&#151;I mean it this time&#151;is about competition. I have listened to this debate continuously since 2000, but I am still not sure what local authorities want. My company in the West Midlands&#151;I had better stick to that area as I know it best&#151;was part of the National Express Group at the time and was accused on the one hand of running a monopoly. On the other hand, when there was competition&#151;the private sector working the way it does, bus drivers whom we had fired for various actions, and who were working quite often for small bus operators, would buy a couple of buses and, under some of the Barnett provisions of the 1986 Act, would turn up on the most lucrative route in the area and invariably run two minutes in front of our buses vehicles that quite frankly would have disgraced provisional Birmingham in the 1930s&#151;we were accused of driving them off the road.</p>

<p><a name="07121268000060"></a>I know nothing about the Stagecoach discussion in Preston, so I cannot comment in detail on what the noble Lord said earlier, but I certainly had enough experience in Birmingham of never knowing what the local authorities wanted. They were against us having a monopoly, then they were against unbridled competition, and I was never quite sure exactly what they wanted. These days, Birmingham has a new chairman who is not me, argumentative as my noble friends might think I am, and a new chief executive of the Passenger Transport Authority, both of whom appear to be united in the view that quality partnerships are the best way forward and that, by working together, they provide a better service for the customer, which is what the Bill and our amendments should be about, rather than about who runs the buses and who does not.</p>

Usually as a Minister you get the amendments listed in your notes, but there were so many amendments in this group that the top of the paper simply reads, &#147;and a group of approximately 30 related amendments&#148;. I congratulate him on doing so.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000002"></a>I have been listening to what has been said over the past half hour or so, thinking that this goes back to issues that were raised as a by-product of what I viewed back at the time, in the mid-1980s, as a rather crazy bus privatisation and bus deregulation Bill put through by the then Conservative Government. That legislation heralded in a time when I thought that we would simply see a continued acceleration of what officials said to me in my local authority was going to be managed decline. Year on year, it seemed that there would be fewer people on our local municipal buses and fewer people on the old green buses run by Southdown. There would be greater irritation as the fares seemed to get larger and larger as a proportion of people&#146;s incomes. I do not think that there were many people who would ever have argued the case for the 1985 legislation in the longer term.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000003"></a>Some imaginative bus operators, whose work came about as a result of the shakedown in the structure of companies that took over services, clearly did see a business opportunity, and I speak as one who lives in an area where it has worked. But it has not worked for the reasons that were set out at the time of the passing of the legislation under Nicholas Ridley. It has worked because in some areas there was a strong desire to see effective, co-operative and partnership working. This legislation and the 2000 legislation seek to build on that concept of partnership to try to improve the quality, standard and variety of services on offer. That is in essence what we are trying to do here.</p>

<p><a name="07121282000004"></a>There has been a lot of criticism this afternoon that the legislation is going in the wrong direction and people have said that the 2000 legislation was a failure. I do not accept that it was a failure in the terms that have been set out before the Committee, because it has played its part in forcing the process of partnership, and we have seen the development of

That is to the good, and we should work from that experience and seek to improve on it. No one is saying that voluntary partnership is a bad thing; most people are saying that it is a good thing but that there are circumstances where we need to give it more of a framework and more of a body and encourage and do more to stimulate the bus market. As we know, there is a tremendous amount of capacity in the bus industry, with much greater capacity to move passengers around, and it has tremendous potential for growth. Those are the issues that we should be wrestling with.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000005"></a>The amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Rosser stimulate some debate about the best way to go. I am aware that, for instance, the question raised on the Approvals Board is an issue that has caused many strongly voiced opinions during consultation. Many are in favour of Approvals Boards and there are also people who are opposed. We have tried to strike a reasonable balance between those competing interests. My noble friend Lord Rosser has opposed the Approvals Board on two grounds. First, he says that it is undemocratic, and, secondly, he says that it will cause delays in what is bound to be a lengthy process to set up a quality contracts scheme. The Transport Committee in another place was fully aware of those arguments, yet it recommended not that the whole idea of a board should be scrapped but that it should simply be modified to amend those concerns as far as possible. That is what we have sought to do.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000006"></a>Let us remember that if Section 126 of the 2000 Act is not amended, a local transport authority in England will still be unable to make a quality contracts scheme without any independent scrutiny; it would need to submit an application to the Secretary of State for approval. That will continue to be the case in Wales, because Approvals Boards would exist only in England. An authority wishing to make a scheme in Wales would, as now, go to the Welsh Ministers for approval.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000007"></a>However, Amendment No. 45 in this group would remove Section 126 of the Transport Act 2000 altogether, removing the approval role of the Welsh Ministers as well as the Approvals Board for England. I do not know whether that was the noble Lord&#146;s intention or whether he has taken any views from our colleagues in Wales on this issue. Our view in England is that giving the approval role to the Secretary of State placed Ministers and officials at the Department for Transport in a very difficult position, because if they so much as discussed a proposal with the local transport authority, there was a risk that it might be seen as a potential fettering of the discretion of the Secretary of State, and thus prejudicial to the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to make an independent and impartial decision about the application. In such circumstances, an aggrieved party would be more likely to mount a legal challenge, which could in turn lead to a costly and even more time-consuming judicial review of the decision. That was why, in England, the Government decided that any scheme should in future be approved by an independent body rather than by a Minister of the Crown.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000008"></a>The local authority that is proposing to make the scheme cannot, by the nature of things, be an impartial judge. It will obviously support the scheme and be keen to get it implemented as soon as possible. The Government therefore believe that the Approvals Board, which would be able to provide the necessary objectivity in weighing up the issues, would be better placed to make such decisions.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000009"></a>It is not the Government&#146;s intention that the Approvals Board will quibble with a local authority on questions of policy. That is rightly a matter for local decision by the democratic process. The notions of manifestos and commitments kick in. The policy issues should be thrashed out in the local authority. The board&#146;s job is to certify that a quality contracts scheme is a reasonable and effective way of implementing that policy and fully satisfies the criteria set out in the new Section 124(1) of the Transport Act 2000 that would be inserted by Clause 18. That is rather more than simply looking at process, but it is a good deal less than interfering in policy matters. I hope that the Committee is reassured on that.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000010"></a>The Government regard it as highly important that the legislation is fully compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. There is a potential tension here over quality contracts schemes because of the right of natural and legal persons, including bus companies, to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions. Of course, the convention right includes a balancing test that enables the state to make laws as considered necessary to control the use of property where that is in the public interest. In this Bill, particularly Clause 18, we have taken care to define the criteria for quality contracts schemes in a way that will ensure that any scheme is in the public interest, and that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of property is not disproportionate to achieving those public interest objectives. But a local authority that is, understandably, intent on getting a better bus service out of operators may not give as much weight as it rightly should to the proportionality of the scheme&#146;s effect on existing operators. In sum, the local authority cannot be expected to be totally impartial in this matter, and if challenged it might find difficulty in proving that it was impartial, to the satisfaction of a court of law.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000011"></a>That is why the Government consider that these sensitive matters should be decided, not by the local authority alone, certainly not by the operators, but by an independent third party with the right expertise who can make decisions with an impartial and open mind. This would not be a traffic commissioner alone, but a commissioner sitting with two other appointees. Although not specified in the Bill, we have it in mind that one would be an expert on transport planning, and the other an expert on transport economics. There may be occasions when, because of the nature of the scheme, other forms of expertise are more important. That is why Clause 21 leaves open the precise constitution of the board, so that each Approvals Board can be set up to include the most appropriate people for the particular case in hand.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000012"></a>The second objection about the Approvals Board is that it will cause unnecessary delay in the making of a quality contracts scheme. As no proposed quality  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contracts schemes have to date been submitted to the Secretary of State or a Welsh Minister for approval, we do not have an easy point of comparison. But it is fair to say that a board that is constituted for one specific purpose is more likely to take a quick decision than a Minister or a government department that always has a host of conflicting priorities coming across its desk at any one time.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000013"></a>We accept the very legitimate comments made by the Transport Committee in another place and others that decisions should be made within a reasonable time. That is why we have made provision in the Bill for the Secretary of State to specify in regulations the period within which the board would be expected to take its decisions. The board would be under an obligation to take all reasonable steps to reach a decision within that specified time. If it failed to do so, the chair of the board would have to write to the Secretary of State and the authority making the application setting out the reasons for the delay. That is all set out in new Section 126B of the Transport Act 2000, which would be inserted by Clause 22.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000014"></a>We have not specified the time limit in the Bill. That might need to be revised in the light of experience, because we simply do not know how complex the decisions are likely to be. But we have in mind something perhaps as short as six weeks as the maximum time between the referral of a case to a board and the delivery of its decisions. That would be shorter than the period normally allowed for consultation, and a great deal shorter than the best estimate of the time it would take to tender for contracts after the scheme has been approved.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000015"></a>This group of amendments goes even further, proposing to dispense not only with an approval mechanism, but with an appeals procedure of any kind. The local transport authority then really would be judge, jury and, I guess, executioner in a way that is totally unacceptable in a modern democratic society. When we are granting powers which have the potential to interfere with private rights to this extent&#151;and whatever some noble Lords may think of bus operators, they do have rights&#151;there has to be some reasonably accessible form of legal redress, for we are talking about the rights not only of the big five transport groups, but of smaller operators.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000016"></a>Removing the Transport Tribunal would not be at all satisfactory from the authority&#146;s point of view either, because there would still be a possibility&#151;we think it is a very strong likelihood&#151;of a bus operator seeking a judicial review of any decision to make a scheme. The judicial review procedure would probably be beyond the means of a small operator, but it would certainly not be beyond the means of a major transport group. The impact on a local transport authority of an expensive and possibly protracted judicial review procedure could be far greater than the impact of an operator appealing&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07121282000017"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121282000109"></a>Baroness Scott of Needham Market:</b> Can the Minister confirm that a judicial review of the running of the tribunal is a possibility? I cannot imagine that it would be outside judicial review proceedings. I am not sure that relying on that as an argument for having a tribunal is entirely valid.</p>

We have put tribunals in place in many areas of public law to try to ease out the need to have recourse to a higher court. That is welcome, because it makes the process easier and more accessible and produces a decision at a lower cost. Ultimately, in the circumstances that we jointly understand, a judicial review would be a practical proposition. If we are seeking to resolve issues in the best interests of the public, we do not want to end up going there on many occasions.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000019"></a>For reasons of cost, a judicial review procedure would weigh heavily on a small operator, but less so against a larger transportation group. The impact on a local transport authority of an expensive and possibly protracted judicial review would be far greater than the impact of an operator appealing against a decision to the Transport Tribunal, which should provide a relatively quick and inexpensive form of redress. We can be quite sure that if the decision-making process were entirely in the hands of a local transport authority with no right of appeal to a tribunal, the temptation for those operators who can afford to go to judicial review would be extremely strong.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked a lot of questions. If I miss any&#151;I am sure I will&#151;we will, as always on these occasions, come up with a letter at the end of the Committee proceedings, which will seek to analyse in some detail what lies behind the questions and provide more information than I can give this afternoon. One of his early questions was how long it would take a local authority to get a quality contracts scheme in place. We recognise the need to ensure that the approvals process does not impose an undue hurdle or delay on implementing schemes. We estimate that a small uncontroversial scheme could go through the statutory processes beginning with the statutory notice prior to consultation in about 15 months. Within that estimate, six weeks is allowed, roughly speaking, for consideration by the Approvals Board.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000021"></a>For a complicated scheme we may need to add up to 10 months for the tendering process, and for appeal to the Transport Tribunal perhaps a further three months. In addition, the approvals board may require a scheme to be modified, which may require some further consultation. We accept the case for inserting time limits into the stages leading to approval by the board. We have made provision in the Bill, but the timings will need to be specified in regulations.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000022"></a>The noble Lord raised the issue of admissible objections, the process for which will be set out in regulations, and he asked about quality contracts schemes more generally. There is a power to hold public inquiries, and there are provisions to protect the confidentiality of financial information, which is right. It would be unusual if that were not the case. He asked whether the quality contracts scheme was possible only when there has been an attempt at a partnership scheme that has failed. The whole point of moving away from the &#147;only practicable way&#148; test is to avoid trying quality partnerships and failing first. It comes back to the point about how best to get improvements in the quality, range, frequency of services, and so on. We all  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recognise that working away at the quality partnership scheme, whether voluntary or otherwise, is the best way to get there. We need to see how it will work in practice and ensure that any quality contracts scheme is proportional and in the public interest&#151;in other words, improves services.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000023"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the powers of the Transport Tribunal and appeals to court. I can fairly say that appeals against decisions of a Transport Tribunal will revolve round a point of law only. The powers of tribunals will be set out in new Section 126E.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000024"></a>I have covered the point about whether approvals boards can overturn the policies of elected authorities. That is not their primary purpose. It is for the local authority to determine policy, which is distilled from manifestos and commitments of local politicians.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, also asked about the costs. That will depend on the nature of the scheme. There probably is scope for cost reduction. A quality contracts scheme could help to avoid overbussing on busy routes, and the tendering process should help to maximise value for money for the local taxpayer, so there are potential benefits.</p>
<h5><a name="07121282000105"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000026"></a>I think that I have answered most of the questions. The noble Lord, Lord Snape, made a point about bus operators and decisions about what sort of services should run and who should be ultimately responsible for them.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000027"></a>I come back to the point from which we departed at the beginning of this discussion; that is, that the Bill is designed to play its part in the continued development of bus networks across the country. We have seen improvements in many areas in quality, frequency and value for money. That is what we try at all times to keep in our mind. We want to ensure that we provide services for the convenience of passengers, so that we have continued beneficial growth in the number of passengers using bus services and get the evident environmental benefits from the continued expansion of bus networks. Ultimately, it is the passenger whose interests should be paramount. Services should not be designed around the convenience of bus operators, they should reflect patterns of genuine need in areas where we need to do more to improve the range and quality of services.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000028"></a>I apologise for the length of my response. I acknowledge that I may well have missed some points that the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, in particular, made. I hope that I have provided reasonably comprehensive answers. If I have failed to do so, I shall endeavour to pick up those points and cover them in correspondence, which I shall share with the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="07121282000029"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121282000111"></a>Lord Snape:</b> Before the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, replies&#151;again, I apologise for detaining the Committee for a moment&#151;may I ask about compensation? I do not want to labour the point. Does my noble friend agree that Parliament has made provision over the years for payment of adequate compensation for dispossessed incumbents who sustain losses as a result  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of changes in regulatory rules on the application of regulatory policy? Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said earlier, there are lots of examples of compensation being paid&#151;for example, in the energy market restructuring, in the introduction of retail competition in the water market and in the regulation of telecommunications. Indeed, the PTAs themselves were, quite rightly, the beneficiaries of compensation paid to them under the privatisation process of the rail industry. Financial compensation via a deed of assumption was paid to many PTAs because of the loss of facilities and amenities as a result of that Act of Parliament.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000030"></a>So there is previous provision. Although I do not want to detain the Committee by spending too long on this, as I said, my noble friend did not mention that in his winding-up speech and I would be grateful if he would do so if he replies again .</p>

Without wanting to labour the point, I went over the issue at some length. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Snape, does not entirely agree with our position on this. He makes a general point about compensation when assets change hands as a result of privatisation, and so on. I understand the point, but our point here is that assets are still in play and it is open to companies to deploy those assets as best they can. I understand the argument; it is not one on which I entirely agree with him.</p>

<p><a name="07121282000033"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07121282000114"></a>Lord Rosser:</b> My noble friend said that he will respond to the questions that he has not covered in his response&#151;there may be one or two. I will obviously look forward to receiving those responses.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000034"></a>There is a fundamental disagreement between us. I think that the processes will put people off the Approvals Board and the Transport Tribunal; clearly my noble friend does not. I think that he referred to the need to meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights. Have the Government had legal advice that it is only by including the provision for an Approvals Board and a Transport Tribunal, as well as the right&#151;which obviously anyone has&#151;to go to court if he is aggrieved, that the position in respect of the European Convention on Human Rights can be covered?</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000035"></a>My argument has been that we do not need the processes of the Approvals Board and the Transport Tribunal and that if a party feels aggrieved by a decision by the local authority&#151;either the decision, the way in which the local authority has carried out its consultation, whether it has listened to responses, whether it has met the criteria laid down in the guidance or whether a party feels that it has been effectively put out of business either completely or in part by the decision of the local transport authority&#151;it has the right to go to court. My point is: is my noble friend saying that, bearing in mind that parties would have as of right a facility to pursue the matter through the court, the Government's legal advice is that that would  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC138"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights? It would be very helpful if my noble friend could reply in very specific terms on that issue.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000036"></a>I will obviously read <I>Hansard</I> carefully concerning what my noble friend said about how long it will take a scheme to go through the process. I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that he said that a non-controversial scheme might take 15 months, although he had said that it would take only six weeks at the Approvals Board and subsequently three months at the Transport Tribunal&#151;at least, that is what I have written down. When he went on to speak by inference about a controversial scheme&#151;one that is being contested&#151;I am afraid that I got a bit lost, because I sensed that on top of the 15 months, we were getting a 10-month period thrown in, and then a three-month period, and I was not quite sure what we were ending up with as the total time that it might take.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000037"></a>My contention was that the quality contracts will be strongly opposed, so that unless the decision by the Approvals Board and the Transport Tribunal goes the way of bus operators&#151;I say this only because I know that they are very much against the arrangements that we have in London&#151;they will pursue it as far as they can, as is their right. If it is not clear in <I>Hansard</I>, I hope that my noble friend will spell out what he thinks will could be the maximum period for a case that is contested right down the line.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000038"></a>I believe that my noble friend also said&#151;once again, I may have misheard him and, if I have, I apologise&#151;that you could end up in the Court of Appeal only on a point of law. Is my noble friend saying that it will not be possible to go to the Court of Appeal and, under the pretext that it is under a point of law, reopen the whole proceedings and effectively have a rerun of what was heard before either the Approvals Board or the Transport Tribunal? In other words, will that be allowed only on a very narrow point of law? It would be very helpful if we could get on record whether that is what my noble friend is saying.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000039"></a>My noble friend Lord Snape made a point about the cost of the arrangements in London. That point is often made in criticism of the franchising arrangements in London. My answer to that is that a political decision to spend X amount of money on the provision of bus services is not a matter for bus operators, it is a matter for local authorities. They should be making those decisions. If they get them wrong and have to increase their local taxes because the amount of money that they get from the Government is not sufficient to cover what they want to do, or if they have to make cuts elsewhere to provide the money, they are accountable to the electorate for that decision. That is as it should be: an elected body should make the decision on how much should or should not be spent on the provision of bus services and is accountable at the ballot box for that decision. That is the purpose of the amendments.</p>

On the ECHR point, we believe that the mechanism that we have described and set out in the legislation is the best way of resolving those issues. My noble friend has, fairly, said at the outset that there is a disagreement on this aspect of our policy. My noble friend is right to pursue that, and he has done so vigorously. My understanding is&#151;I have made the point before&#151;that appeal to the Court of Appeal would be on a point of law, and it would have to be on that narrow range of consideration and it could not be to unpick the policy that has led to the way in which the process has been used.</p>

<p><a name="07121282000041"></a>On the time taken to see this process through, I have described it at some length in my earlier reply. I am minded, if my noble friend continues to be unhappy about the way in which I set that out, to try to get officials to construct a timeline so that my noble friend can see how the thing operates over a particular period. As I made plain at the outset, I am more than happy to put some of this stuff down in writing and respond to points that I perhaps have not covered as fully as I should. I always try to do that. I will share the contents of that letter with all noble Lords and put a copy in the Library of the House.

<p><a name="07121282000049"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 55. The Committee will be relieved to hear that my amendment addresses a rather simpler matter.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000050"></a>The issue of accessibility of consultation documents is important if the consultation process is to be effective. We have already raised concerns regarding the requirement to consult certain people and organisations. I note that there will be a new requirement to publish a consultation before introducing a new quality contracts scheme and that new guidance will be produced regarding that. It is essential for the guidance to highlight two things. First, there is the need to make the consultation document available in accessible formats and, secondly, there is the need to publish its availability in those accessible formats. The comments on consultation should also apply to other consultation requirements in the Bill.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000051"></a>Clause 19(2) would require a notice to go into at least one newspaper circulated in the area. Most notices in local papers are in the smallest possible print, which is unreadable for anyone with a sight problem. It is  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>essential that legislation encourages the use of talking newspapers, where they are available, to publish the consultations.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000052"></a>The Minister&#146;s right honourable friend Rosie Winterton has said that she believes that it is the representative bodies rather than individuals that need to be consulted, and of course she is right in many cases. However, in many areas there will be a local society representing blind and partially sighted people, which would need to be consulted. The person responding on behalf of the local society or another organisation may well be visually impaired, so it is essential that notices are not just confined to the print media.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000053"></a>In addition, where there is no local society, individual visually impaired people will need to be consulted if an authority is to discharge its duties to carry out an effective disability equality impact assessment. The noble Lord, Lord Low, has drafted an amendment designed to achieve the same effect. Unfortunately, I do not think that he will be able to speak to it today. No doubt the noble Lord will pursue it at a later stage, if necessary. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="07121282000106"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07121282000054"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121282000118"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, for the passionate way in which he has put forward the needs of blind and partially sighted people who use buses and who may wish to comment on proposals for quality contracts schemes. As the noble Earl will know, there are other groups who, for one reason or another, are unable to read printed text. Local authorities of course have general responsibilities towards people with visual impairment under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. We therefore fully expect local authorities to take their particular needs into account. Since December 2006, it has also been unlawful for certain transport operators, including bus operators, to discriminate against disabled people in the provision of goods, facilities or services, or to fail to make a reasonable adjustment so that their services are accessible. Where a local authority wishes to consult all members of the public, or all constituents living in a particular area, it needs to make provision for those who cannot read normal printed matter. A talking newspaper, if there is one in the area, may be an efficient way of doing so.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000055"></a>However, as the noble Earl has said, the Transport Act 2000 does not require the local transport authority to consult all members of the public, but only various representative bodies. These consultation requirements are not being substantially modified by this Bill and there will continue to be a requirement to consult organisations which represent local users. Advertising in a local newspaper&#151;a common requirement in legislation&#151;gives the public a reasonable opportunity to respond. I take on board the point made by the noble Earl about the typeface of that print and the importance of it being easily read. But even doing that is not, and cannot claim to be, a guarantee that it will reach everyone. Many people do not read a local newspaper and those who do may not read them from cover to cover. The primary consultation is with the representative organisations.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000056"></a>The precise way in which consultation is carried out is left very much to the discretion of the authorities. We would not wish to make the requirement more prescriptive than it needs to be. Many, I hope, will want to consult local organisations representing blind or partially sighted people and people with other forms of disability. They also may want to consult representatives of certain minority groups. How best an individual authority does this without going to disproportionate lengths is very much a matter for each to determine, taking into account the particular nature of their local area. All local authorities are accustomed to consulting on all manner of issues and I see no need why the general duties on local authorities in this area should not be seen as adequate.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000057"></a>Nevertheless, we have looked at this amendment very seriously. We have an opportunity to include something relevant in the guidance to local authorities. The important thing will be to draw their attention to the need to consult local representatives of disabled people who may have an effective means of communicating with their members in the most appropriate medium. I accept that this point is not covered in the published draft, but there will be plenty of opportunities to add to that. I shall certainly draw this to the attention of departmental officials working on the guidance document. I hope, with those assurances, that I can persuade the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It is our view that consultation should be paramount when setting up a potentially highly contentious scheme.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000071"></a>In the parts of the Bill that deal with appeals when setting up and continuing a quality contracts scheme, it is curious that there exist provisions that appeals may be lodged only by persons originally consulted during the consultation stage of the proposal. That creates a perverse incentive to consult as narrowly as possible, which is not in the interests of performing a well rounded and meaningful consultation.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0004.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000072"></a>The amendment is linked to my earlier amendment, which sought to ensure that neighbouring local transport authorities were consulted when setting up a quality contract scheme. If, for instance, this were not explicitly mentioned, one can imagine that it might be in the interests of an authority to neglect this important consultation. Thereafter, the neighbouring LTA would have no opportunity to appeal against an application. Should this be the case, legitimate reasons why a local authority may oppose or suggest would be entirely overlooked, with the possibility of the quality contract undermining the relationship between neighbours. The need for consultation is therefore evident. In ironing out these issues and collaborating with other authorities, a scheme is more likely to be a success. I suggest that we allow any person or organisation listed in the consultation requirements in the Transport Act 2000 to express their view, regardless of their contribution at earlier stages in the process. I beg to move.</p>

However, my point today is that that is already provided for.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71212-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000074"></a>Section 125(3) of the Transport Act 2000 requires the local authority proposing the scheme to consult other authorities that might be affected by the scheme, and any person who was consulted in accordance with Section 125(3) has a right of appeal under new Section 126D. Regarding the continuation of a scheme, this requirement also applies by virtue of new Section 131A(4), to be inserted by Clause 29, with a parallel right of appeal in new Section 131D. A neighbouring authority&#151;that is, one with a common boundary to the authority making the scheme&#151;would normally be affected by it and would fall to be consulted under Section 125(3). It would therefore have a right to appeal. But that might not always be the case, because if the scheme was fairly small, and based at one end of the county, it might have no impact at all on a county bordering at the other end. For example, would Essex County Council be affected by a quality contracts scheme promoted by Suffolk that only affected the area, say, around Lowestoft?</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000075"></a>Conversely, a local authority that does not have a common boundary with the one making the scheme might be affected by it, particularly where there are  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>small unitary authorities. Travel-to-work patterns can cross more than one boundary. The wording in the Transport Act 2000 would catch them too. Apart from the specified consultees, there is a general category of,</p>
<ul><a name="07121282000102"></a>&#147;such other persons as the Authority thinks fit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121282000096"></a>That could include a local authority that is not directly affected by a scheme, but which might, nevertheless, as the noble Earl has said, have a legitimate interest and valid observations to make. My view, therefore, is that the powers in Clauses 24 and 32 are just as wide as they need to be; to go further would be to risk the appeal process getting out of control. I therefore hope that I can persuade the noble Lord to withdraw this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07121282000082"></a>The noble Lord said: My Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 are in the same group. Amendment No. 49 would mean that once a quality contracts scheme was in place, it would remain indefinitely and would allow a local transport authority to renew that contract periodically without having to go through a new approval process each time. There seems to be an appropriate clause in the Bill, which sets out the process for the continuation of such a scheme. It appears to be a fairly lengthy process. My main point in putting forward this amendment is that once we have a quality contracts scheme in place which would remain indefinitely, if I have read the Bill correctly, we should be in a position where, instead of having to renew it after it has been in place for 10 years,</p>
<ul><a name="07121282000103"></a>&#147;it would remain in [force] until such time as the authority ... that made the scheme determine&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121282000097"></a>otherwise. That would seem to me to bring it rather more in line&#151;though my noble friend may correct me&#151;with what happens in Transport for London which, as far as I know, does not have to go through the kind of approval process that is set out in the Bill when contracts are re-let.</p>

I am not a lawyer, but I understand that under EU law such a contract is generally limited to 10 years in duration but may, if the operator has made a significant investment in the service provided under the contract, be extended by up to 50 per cent. Obviously, if my noble friend agrees that that is the case&#151;which he may not&#151;the principle underlying the amendment would be that operators might be more willing to invest in assets such as garages, vehicles and staff development under a longer-term contract than they would under a shorter-term contract. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121282000084"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121282000126"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My noble friend Lord Rosser has made some interesting and valid points, but in the end I am not convinced by the entirety of his argument. A quality contracts scheme must in current circumstances be regarded as something of an experiment. No one has yet tried one, and although the noble Lord referred to London and there are perhaps continental examples where a similar system is in force, we are very much at the experimental stage. Those are places where there has long been a publicly operated network, which has then been franchised out to private operators. A quality contracts scheme would replace deregulated services, and the task of setting up a regulated network from scratch is of a very different order from the task of adapting an existing one.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000085"></a>It could well be that a quality contracts scheme is set up which simply does not work. &#147;Very well&#148;, you may say, &#147;the local authority can always revoke it&#148;, but institutional inertia may set in, and those who have a vested interest in keeping it going may seek to have their way. Other cases will be less clear-cut. The scheme may not be doing very well, not at all well even, but the local authority may still be optimistic that, given a bit more time, it will succeed. In the mean time, bus operators may be champing at the bit, noticing all the mistakes that the authority is making, but powerless to put them right.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000086"></a>Under the current legislation, the local authority would effectively have to start again from scratch if it wanted a scheme to continue in force. In response to comments from stakeholders, the Bill provides a mechanism to enable a scheme to be continued, with a modified process for approval. At the end of the period for which the scheme is approved, which may not exceed 10 years, for it to continue in force it must be reviewed and a further consultation take place to ensure that it has delivered at least some of what was promised, and is still relevant and likely to deliver more. This new process provides that if the scheme will not expand in scope and not involve new areas or new bus services, it can go ahead without the board&#146;s approval, though with an appeal mechanism. If it will expand, the approval of the board or, in Wales, the Ministers, will still be necessary.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000087"></a>The second amendment in this group concerns the length of individual contracts rather than the whole scheme. In the Transport Act 2000, the contract length is set at five years and the scheme at 10 years. There were many representations from local transport authorities that five years was too short for a large-scale, good-value bus contract, and we tried to respond to those. I  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understand that my noble friend&#146;s point is that a maximum length is set out in community legislation. That being the case, however, it need not be set in our own legislation. I cannot follow the noble Lord&#146;s argument that local authorities should be able to take advantage of the extra 50 per cent that is allowed in some circumstances under the new EC regulation, which will come into force in 12 months.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000088"></a>A contract to run a bus network, or part of a bus network, is not comparable to designing, building and operating a contract for a light rail system. The Community regulation recognises the difference by specifying a maximum of 15 years for rail contracts and 10 years for bus contracts. The extra 50 per cent on either limit for significant assets is not likely to be relevant in the case of a contract to run bus services, or even a whole bus network.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000089"></a>There are many good arguments why a private company should not be given such a lengthy contract to run a public service. We are not persuaded by the noble Lord&#146;s arguments, and I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07121282000090"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07121282000127"></a>Lord Rosser:</b> I want to ensure that I have understood the point that has been made. On the second amendment, I think that my noble friend is saying that the Community legislation would not apply in the circumstances of the bus contract. I took his reply to mean that he drew a distinction between bus and rail. On the first amendment, which would allow a quality contract to continue and not have to be re-let with a lengthy process, as set out in the Bill, I shall paraphrase what I believe my noble friend said. His argument is that the quality contract might not be satisfactory and might not be working as people intended. It might be working adversely against the interests of bus operators, so there should not be the facility simply to renew it after it has expired and then carry on with it in the same form. Is he saying that if you agree a quality contract that does not work as intended, let us say from a bus operator&#146;s point of view, the bus operator has no redress until the 10 years for which the contract was let has expired, if that is how long the contract has been let for?</p>

In those circumstances, one would expect the bus operator to enter into discussions and negotiations with the local authority. That may not be quite the same as saying that there is a form of redress, but it would be rather strange if the contract was not working and there was no facility or opportunity to revisit current arrangements and see what they are delivering and not delivering. One would expect that to happen in those terms.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121282000092"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s first issue, the Community regulation applies, but there is a difference, which is what I was drawing attention to. The regulation recognises the difference by specifying a maximum of 15 years for rail contracts and 10 years for bus contracts. The extra 50 per cent on either limit for significant assets is not likely to be relevant to a contractor on bus services. This is because of the difference in the nature of the service being offered. I am happy to set out more of the rationale for the noble Lord when we pick up some of these issues in correspondence.</p>

<p><a name="07121284000021"></a>The noble Lord said: Bearing in mind that the wording of the amendment is fairly lengthy, it is straightforward&#151;at least, it is if I have correctly understood the Bill. Clause 37 allows for the &#147;appropriate national authority&#148; to issue guidance to local transport authorities on quality contract schemes. The effect of my amendment would be to ensure that statutory guidance about quality contract schemes was subject to appropriate consultation. My amendment refers to the appropriate national authority consulting,</p>

<p><a name="07121284000056"></a>I tabled this amendment to ensure that that quality contract scheme guidance is subject to full consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, since that guidance could be fundamental to whether quality contract schemes get off the ground or not. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121284000022"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121284000087"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I shall speak to Clause 37 stand part. We are told that the Bill will put power into the hands of local transport authorities, and allow them to decide the appropriate mode of bus operation for their areas. I was therefore interested to see that Clause 37 allows the Secretary of State in England, and the Welsh Ministers in Wales, to issue guidance concerning the performance of quality contract schemes; we have had a lot of discussion about that this afternoon, but this is an additional point. Under the second part of the clause, it is stated that authorities must have regard to such guidance.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000023"></a>What sort of guidance does the Minister expect that national authorities may have to give, and why is it required? In the case of poor performance, how does he envisage this guidance may be of assistance and what could be done? My concern is that this advice could turn into central regulation&#151;we have seen enough of that&#151;which is not what local bus operators need or would benefit from.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000024"></a>I am therefore uncertain that this clause is needed. The Bill already contains measures to consult widely and, although these could be improved by our previously suggested amendments, they should presumably suffice in ensuring a quality contract scheme is fair. Can the Minister justify why this clause is needed, and what would be the effect if it were removed?</p>
<h5><a name="07121284000084"></a>6 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07121284000025"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07121284000088"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Rosser and to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. We have two sides of the coin in this set of amendments. We have heard varying views on the subject of guidance documents on quality contract schemes. My noble friend Lord Rosser proposes what we might call an elaborate parliamentary procedure for approving guidance. By contrast, the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, wants to remove the guidance clause altogether.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000026"></a>I turn first to the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. I should begin by explaining why we need Clause 37 at all&#151;the thrust of the noble Lord&#146;s argument. The Transport Act 2000 in its present form contains no power for the appropriate national authority to provide statutory guidance on quality contracts schemes. In response to requests from local authorities and others, the Department for Transport issued guidance, which might, I suppose, be described as an advisory document, intended to help local transport authorities in preparing their submissions for approval.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000027"></a>As under the current legislation the Secretary of State himself or herself would be approving the schemes, and could only do so if in his or her opinion the criteria were met and the public interest served, there was no reason then to have a statutory power to issue guidance.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000028"></a>However, the Bill proposes to transfer the Secretary of State&#146;s approval role in England to an Approvals Board independent of the Government. It would be  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>possible, of course, for the Government simply to stand back and let the local authorities and the Approvals Board work out for themselves how best to handle proposals for quality contract schemes. But such is the public interest, and such are the legitimate concerns of bus operators that the system will work to their disadvantage, that we think it would be irresponsible of the Government to take such a hands-off approach. For similar reasons, there is a power in new Section 126B(7) for the Secretary of State to issue guidance to the Approvals Board.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000029"></a>Clause 37 of course gives a power to the Welsh Ministers, as well as the Secretary of State, to issue guidance, as they are the appropriate national authority for a scheme in Wales. As the Welsh Ministers will themselves continue to be the approval authority, there may not be such a pressing need for the provision as in England, but since our Ministers in England found it useful to issue guidance on a non-statutory basis in any case, it seems entirely reasonable to allow Welsh Ministers the option of a statutory power, and they are in favour of having it.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000030"></a>Issuing guidance under a statutory power of course gives it extra weight. There may well be cases where the Committee would see advantage in that. For example, we have been debating earlier today the provision of facilities for disabled people and ensuring that their concerns are taken into account in consultation about local schemes. We came to the conclusion that that might be a suitable matter to include in guidance, rather than in the Bill. If Ministers included advice on that in the guidance document, I am sure that noble Lords would want local authorities to follow it. They are more likely to do so if the guidance has statutory force.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000031"></a>In response to the points raised by my noble friend Lord Rosser&#146;s amendments, we have no objection in principle to the parliamentary scrutiny of departmental guidance. Indeed, a draft guidance document has already been made available for the House&#151;and the Committee in particular&#151;to consider. It forms Volume 4 of the large guidance document that has been laid in the House Library, and copies are available in the Table Office. That volume is a draft of what could become the guidance under Clause 37 if it is enacted. It is very much a preliminary draft, but we hope that publishing it at this stage will help inform the parliamentary debates.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000032"></a>Nor do we have any objection to consulting on the guidance, in particular with the local transport authorities to which it is addressed. Indeed, in this day and age it would be most unusual for a document of this type to be published without a period of formal consultation. The department has not done so formally to date, because it is still an early stage in the Bill process. However, there has been informal consultation with a range of interested parties, and the department has taken account of the views of the various stakeholders, even at this stage. The document is available on the internet, and the department would welcome any comments that noble Lords might have.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000033"></a>We do not believe that it is necessary for the guidance to be made by order and in particular for such an order to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We anticipate that the guidance may need to be amended in the light of experience, and it is important that the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers have the flexibility to do that as we learn from the implementation of the process. Requiring a debate in both Houses would be very time consuming for Parliament and might mean that the guidance would be revised less often than would be helpful. That could be counterproductive.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000034"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Rosser that the department will, of course, go out to full consultation before any guidance is issued in its final form. We hope by then to have had the benefit of many lively debates in this House. I hope that noble Lords who have not already done so will avail themselves of the opportunity to read the draft guidance, which is intended to make things clearer for local authorities rather than to put additional hurdles in their way. My noble friend Lord Rosser asked whether we would consult on guidance. As I have just said, we certainly will consult. We have already published the initial draft, and we will consult fully and formally next year. My noble friend also asked whether guidance would face parliamentary scrutiny. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not see the need for an elaborate parliamentary procedure that underpins the view that we have as far as the Government are concerned on not going down that more elaborate parliamentary path.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0005.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked a question to which I do not see an answer in my notes. If I have not covered it, I will ensure that he receives an answer in writing.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000041"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment seeks effectively to replace the existing Clause 38, which is inadequate to achieve the objectives that I hope it was intended to  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieve. I reiterate that I am not a lawyer, but what I want to say about this issue seeks to reflect a legal opinion that I have seen.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000042"></a>Clause 38 inserts a new Section 134B into the Transport Act 2000. There are three main problems that the clause as drafted appears not to address; namely the application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, the issue of the two-tier workforce and pension protection. Clause 38 gives no guarantee that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations will apply in any circumstances relevant to the introduction of a quality contracts scheme.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000043"></a>That is obviously important, as TUPE will generally provide the basis of any protection of any employee&#146;s terms and conditions of service. TUPE protects the employment and terms and conditions of existing employees in two circumstances: first, in the context of a business transfer; secondly, in the context of service provision change. In order for there to be service provision change, there must be some end client in place before and after the putative transfer. It is hard to see how the introduction of a quality contracts scheme could meet that requirement. Although there would certainly be a change in the provision of service, there would be no continuing client. Before the change, bus services would be provided on a straightforward private basis by the former operator, not on behalf of the local authority. After the change, the services would be provided by a private bus operator, but now on behalf of the local authority. It is unlikely that the change in service provision in that context would amount to a relevant process for the purpose of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000044"></a>The possibility of there being a business transfer will depend on the circumstances of each case. The definition requires that there is,</p>
<ul><a name="07121284000083"></a>&#147;an economic entity that retains its identity upon the transfer&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121284000057"></a>Although it seems likely that there would be a pre-existing economic entity, the real question is whether there was a retention of identity on the introduction of a quality contracts scheme and the change from a service provided by one or more companies to a service provided by a different operator. It is very hard to predict with any certainty whether the circumstances of a particular quality contracts scheme would constitute a relevant &#147;business transfer&#148;, especially given the possible delays in the introduction and implementation of a quality contracts scheme, which we have already discussed, and the very different approaches that may be taken by local authorities in that regard.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000045"></a>What seems most likely is that there will be cases where different operators will tender for a quality contract on a different basis&#151;whether or not TUPE will apply&#151;and that disputes on that issue would have to be resolved by the employment tribunal. Indeed, the less scrupulous operator might even try to evade the consequences of TUPE&#151;the need to take on the staff of the unsuccessful transferor or transferors on their existing terms and conditions&#151;by refusing to employ existing employees of other companies and relying on that fact as evidence in itself of there being no relevant transfer.</p>

<p><a name="07121284000046"></a>Clause 38 does not reduce that uncertainty. Indeed, it may be argued that it positively encourages those bidding for the quality contract to do so on the basis that they will not take on the staff of the unsuccessful operator. After all, it is only if the successful bidder takes on existing staff that it will be bound to maintain their previous terms and conditions. If the successful bidder wished to reduce terms and conditions, it would plainly be entirely against its interest to take on the staff of previous operators. That approach should be contrasted by that adopted by the Government in respect of staff transfers in the public sector, whether at national or local level.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000047"></a>Clause 38 does not provide greater certainty for the workforce, nor does it give them any assurances of any value. By failing to deem that TUPE should be taken to apply or that quality contracts might be tendered out by local authorities on that basis, Clause 38 encourages ambiguity, inconsistency and uncertainty as to the application of TUPE and singularly fails to provide any assurance of continued employment to members of the existing workforce. It is likely to lead to complex and lengthy litigation that may bring clarity only through a tribunal court ruling after several years.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000048"></a>As for the two-tier workforce issue, although the most immediate concern must be for the current employees, who may be refused employment or offered employment under less favourable terms and conditions by the successful bidder for the quality contract, in the medium to long term, issues will also arise about those subsequently recruited into service by the operator in question. Subsequent re-tenders of the quality contract would inevitably fall under the protection of TUPE and the local authority code, because they would be service provision changes in which the end client would remain the local authority. But that protection would be to no avail if the initial introduction of the quality contracts scheme permitted new recruits to be employed on less favourable terms and conditions, thereby diluting the standard of entitlement of the workforce over time.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000049"></a>Clause 38 does nothing to address that issue. The only obligation on a successful service provider under a quality contracts scheme will be to employ the current staff, but it is not obliged to do so on their existing terms and conditions. It is silent on the treatment of any new recruits, and it can only be assumed that the operator in question would be free to employ staff on the least favourable terms and conditions that the free market permits. Once that has happened, any subsequent protection that might be afforded under TUPE or the local government code would effectively be rendered academic.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000050"></a>The concern about pension provision arises in respect of employees currently employed by a service operator that is unsuccessful in its bid or because it does not bid for a quality contract, but is then taken on by the successful bidder. Pension provision is an exception to the normal TUPE rule, whereby rights and obligations under a contract of employment continue in force for the transferee, and any variation by reason of the transfer is rendered void. To ensure that anticipated benefits under occupational pension schemes were to  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be continued on a &#147;no less favourable basis&#148;, separate provision is necessary. The privatisation of rail services provides a precedent for such guarantees, and further, the local authority code provides similar guarantees when employees are transferred from the public to the private sector. A <I>Fair Deal for Staff Pensions</I>, annexed to the local authority statement, shows that the terms of a transfer should specify that transferred employees must have access to a scheme certified as &#147;broadly comparable&#148; by a professionally qualified actuary unless exceptional circumstances apply. The protections afforded in the local authority code of practice would serve to meet the concerns I have expressed, and would offer a consistency of approach with which local authorities are already familiar in other contexts. My amendments would achieve that goal.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000051"></a>To summarise, as drafted, Clause 38 provides little, if any protection for existing employees&#146; terms and conditions. It leaves it entirely uncertain whether TUPE will apply in any given case. It is likely to encourage tenders on different bases by service operators, and may even encourage a refusal by those seeking to evade the application of TUPE to take on current staff of other unsuccessful operators. Clause 38 also discourages the maintenance of the existing level of terms and conditions as new recruits may be offered the least favourable terms that the free market will permit. That will, first, encourage the successful operator to seek to avoid taking on employees currently working on the service, but for different bus companies. Secondly, to the extent that such staff might be taken on, it will lead to the creation of a two-tier workforce. Thirdly, it will bring about the lowering of standards recognised by the code of practice on workforce matters in local authority service contracts before that code can have direct application to quality contracts schemes, thereby rendering its subsequent effect academic. Finally, Clause 38 provides no protection in respect of existing pension provision either on a no-less-favourable basis or even, at least arguably, on the minimum standards required under the Pensions Act 2004. My amendments would rectify the inadequacies of Clause 38. I beg to move.</p>

The introduction of the TUPE provisions in Clause 38, following consultation on the draft, seems sensible if it works. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has outlined the TUPE problem far better than I could. As I understand it, there has to be both an economic entity transferring and an equivalent job available. In the case of only part of a depot needing to transfer, and the new employer not requiring as many staff, would TUPE automatically apply?</p>

<p><a name="07121284000058"></a>Is this not the same principle as that involving the franchise of a bus network, or part thereof? My amendment would similarly protect the pension rights of individuals when setting up a quality contract. That would provide security to employees in the

It would also prevent any unnecessary interference in the process by employees fearful of their pension rights.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121284000054"></a>We want the costing of including pensioners to be part of the consultation when deciding to propose setting up a quality contracts scheme. Operators would have to take this into account when placing their bid. No doubt the Minister may say that the Government will want local authorities to specify TUPE-style requirements that go beyond the minimum requirements set out in the Bill, but some clarification of where the Government stand on this issue would be helpful and would provide security to employees in the industry.</p>

<p><a name="07121287000001"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121287000084"></a>Lord Snape:</b> Both amendments relate to very serious points. For the first time in Committee, I agree entirely with the words of my noble friend Lord Rosser. These matters should certainly be included in the Bill, but the clause does not properly include them. Mind you, this does point out a few disparities in the system that my noble friend seeks to embrace. Indeed, the whole principle of franchising, which is behind the principle of quality contracts, depends on someone bidding lower than someone else to obtain a particular franchise.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000002"></a>For some reason, my noble friend and those who brief him apparently overlooked this point, so we come to the clause. Of course it is essential that pension provision is properly protected. Indeed, reputable companies such as FirstGroup and National Express did so when they acquired companies. National Express provided a mirror-image scheme to the local government pension scheme to guarantee that employees continued to be protected and enjoy the same benefits that they would have enjoyed had the company that was acquired&#151;West Midlands Travel&#151;remained in the municipal sector. Similarly, FirstGroup gave exactly the same mirror-image guarantees to the companies that they acquired.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000003"></a>A great deal has been said about this in our debates on the Bill, but I have to point out that the London experience was based on entirely the opposite premise. The original franchises for London were based on the cheapest operator bidding on the ground of buying out the terms and conditions, including the pension provision, of many bus workers in London at the time. Yet we are told that this is the example that local authorities and those who speak on their behalf before your Lordships should follow. It was not until Transport for London and the current Mayor&#146;s present policies were actually followed that many of the working conditions which the London bus staff had been deprived of were restored. I would go so far as to say that working conditions have nothing to do with regulation or deregulation. The London experience, and its admitted benefits, is based entirely on the amount of money that is being thrown at&#151;I choose my words carefully&#151;the London bus industry.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000004"></a>Apparently, people see no contradiction between demanding a franchising system and then saying, &#147;But hey, you&#146;ve got to protect the interests of the workforce&#148;. I agree with them; you should protect the interests of the workforce. The more the interests of the workforce are protected, the less likely it is that there will be

There is more to this, of course, than wages and pensions. Companies such as FirstGroup and National Express have share-saver schemes for their employees. Under existing Revenue rules, share-saver schemes are available only to the employees of that particular company. If a company such as National Express or FirstGroup&#151;I name those two because they are the ones I have the most experience of&#151;bid for a quality contract and failed, their employees would, under existing Revenue regulations, have to give up their participation in the share-saver scheme. I wonder whether my noble friend and those who brief him have discussed these matters with those employers or whether he would consider adding to his amendment that some provision ought to be made&#151;although I very much doubt whether Revenue and Customs would allow it&#151;for share-saver schemes to be transferred across in the event of a franchise operation.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000005"></a>Both the amendments are eminently sensible and I hope that my noble friend can accept them. I would be delighted to hear his view on some of the other benefits, not just the ones that I have already mentioned. Some people in local government talk about competition and the lack of it. All too often, smaller competing companies&#151;for very good reasons, although I do not defend them&#151;do not provide things such as canteens, proper uniforms or union recognition. Why does my noble friend not write that into some of his amendments? I am sure that it will not come as a great surprise to him that some smaller companies that would take the quality contracts that he and those who brief him are so anxious to include in the Bill would love to be able to derecognise many of the major trade unions in the industry. I hope that he will come back with further amendments to make sure that they do not.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000006"></a>I repeat that if my noble friend accepts both amendments, as the Government should, it will reveal the nonsense of quality contracts and the injustices of the franchising system that lies behind quality contracts.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000007"></a>Finally, if we are to have proper, comprehensive bus services, we should pay the staff properly and give them adequate working conditions, not subject their employment conditions to the lottery of franchising and quality contracts. I hope that my noble friend can accept the amendments and I congratulate those who have tabled them for the common sense that lies behind them.</p>

A vast range of subjects has been raised and I shall not be able to answer all the points this afternoon, but I may in the end reach a position that noble Lords may think is more helpful than it was when we started thinking about these issues.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000009"></a>The TUPE regulations, and the Acquired Rights Directive which they implement, deal with straightforward cases where a workforce employed on a particular public function, such as waste collection, is transferred to do the same work under a new contractor.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000010"></a>As noble Lords have pointed out, the position when a quality contracts scheme is set up is more complex because the starting point is different. Before the scheme is introduced, employees are working for the provider of bus services, in most cases, on a commercial basis by a private sector operator. When the scheme comes into force, those services are instead to be provided under contract to the local authority, either by the same operator or by a different one, depending on who wins the contract following a competitive tender. The end state is very similar to that of a refuse collector employed by a contractor of the local authority, but the workforce is not being transferred from the local authority or from another contractor doing the same work on behalf of that authority.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000011"></a>The transfer of work will not necessarily involve the transfer of physical assets, such as vehicles or depots, although in some cases it may, as we have discussed. The pattern of services to be delivered under quality contracts may differ considerably from what the operators provided under deregulation. Indeed, one of the main reasons for making a quality contracts scheme may be that the authority wants a different, and better, network. Often, too, there will not be a one-for-one correspondence between the old employer and the new one, and some personnel will not have to transfer at all because particular routes will not transfer. Duty rosters may have to be redesigned and staff moved from one depot to another. It is not a straightforward transfer&#151;or at least it will not be in all cases.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000012"></a>Let us assume that the local market is divided by two or three large employers and a handful of small ones. Under quality contracts, the market may be carved up in a very different way, but some of the changes may balance out. So it may be easier for an employer to keep the same drivers and allocate them to different routes than to transfer them to another operator who has taken over the routes that those drivers originally worked on and get some different ones back in exchange. That might also be a great deal easier for the drivers themselves. I am not saying that will happen everywhere, but we need to make allowance for it.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000013"></a>Clause 38 says, in effect, that any employee who is transferred to the holder of a quality contract will be transferred on TUPE terms. It does not require all the contractors to take over all the workforce, but it will apply TUPE to a number of transfers that would not fall under the regulations but for this clause.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000014"></a>Even if I had not been aware before, I was certainly made aware today that the trade unions and some local transport authorities&#151;and possibly even some operators&#151;would like the Bill to go further and require all contractors to take on all their allocated drivers on TUPE terms. This would be in keeping with the general principles of TUPE, but it does beg the question of who would allocate the drivers if their current job is split between two or more contractors and their current shift patterns would simply not fit into the new service patterns of any of the contractors that subsequently undertake the service.</p>

<p><a name="07121287000015"></a>This may be more a matter of practicalities than of principle, but whatever we do here, it is important that we make a provision that will work equally well across the board in respect of a range of different types of quality contracts scheme. We need to ensure that the provision works where all the existing services provided by one incumbent operator transfer en bloc to another single operator, but equally we need to ensure that it would work where services operated by one incumbent operator are split across a number of new operators, perhaps with new routes previously not provided at all. We need to do so in a way that would not overburden operators and unreasonably escalate the costs of a quality contracts scheme. That said, I am happy to take this point away and discuss it further with the Minister of State. At this stage I cannot say more than that, but we are prepared to have more discussions on it to see whether we can perfect what we have.</p>

We want the provisions in this Bill to be as consistent as is reasonably possible with the legislation applying elsewhere. We do not want to go further than that, but again I am happy to go away and ask my ministerial colleagues to give this further thought.

We agree that there are a good many circumstances in which the interests of bus passengers can best be served by co-operation between bus operators and, in many cases, the local authorities involved. At this point, perhaps I may also pay tribute to the Campaign for Better Transport, which undertook some work earlier in the year on this aspect of the Bill. That work has been very helpful in reinforcing the importance of ensuring that competition law genuinely serves the best interests of passengers. This is why we have made provision in the Bill for a &#147;tailored&#148; competition test, which would apply to voluntary partnership agreements and certain other agreements involving a local authority, in place of the test contained in Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000031"></a>In taking this rather innovative approach, we have sought to ensure that the interests of bus passengers are well served while also ensuring that our approach does not undermine the Government&#146;s wider policy on competition. I am sure that Members of the Committee will recognise that maintaining healthy competition is an important driver of innovation and growth in our economy. The leading role played by local authorities in developing and negotiating voluntary partnership agreements is critical here. It is this feature of voluntary partnership agreements that, in the Government&#146;s view, justifies the departure from the usual provisions of the Competition Act. We recognise that passengers may benefit from certain types of agreement between two or more bus operators&#151;for example, to ensure that services operate at evenly spaced intervals.</p>

<p><a name="07121287000032"></a>Where such provision is in agreements which support voluntary partnership agreements or quality partnership schemes, the provision in Schedule 2 would provide that, in certain circumstances, they would be subject to the new Part 2 test. Those circumstances are where the local authority certifies that the agreement is in the public interest and that any restrictions which would affect competition are necessary in order to meet the

But where a local authority does not make such a certification, the agreement would need to satisfy the appropriate test in the Competition Act 1998.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000033"></a>The intention behind the agreement is clear. It is right that such an agreement would not by itself fall within the scope of the new competition test, but, in our view, that provides a useful incentive for operators to work in partnership with local authorities. The scope of the proposed new test is intended to encourage bus operators to explore scope for agreement, not<I></I>in isolation from the local authority&#146;s efforts to improve services but in close partnership and collaboration with them. We consider that this partnership approach is more likely to deliver the best outcomes for passengers than if local authorities and bus operators pursue their own agendas independently.</p>

<p><a name="07121287000034"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee will appreciate that the approach we propose has been given careful thought and that it shows more flexibility on the part of the Office of Fair Trading. We consider that it provides a real improvement on the current situation and preserves the right incentives for bus operators to work not in isolation but in partnership with local authorities.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000035"></a>We do not think that we can accept the proposal in the amendment, namely that any agreement between two operators should automatically fall within the scope of that provision, but we are prepared to consider whether anything more can usefully be done in this area. Without absolutely committing myself to bringing anything back at a later stage, I am prepared to say that we will give it some further thought and see what more we can do. I recognise the importance of the issues that the amendment raises.</p>

<p><a name="07121287000040"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121287000094"></a>Lord Rosser</b> moved Amendment No. 61:</p>

</ul><ul>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000041"></a>The noble Lord said: The Bill sets out a competition test for quality partnership schemes and for voluntary partnership agreements. That test, which is as I understand it an amended version of what is described as Schedule 10 to the Transport Act 2000, applies in place of the general provisions of the appropriate chapter, which I think is Section 1 of the Competition Act. Schedule 10 means that, where the advantages of partnership  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements, such as benefits to passengers, reduced traffic congestion or improvements to facilities or vehicles outweigh the disadvantages of reduced competition, those arrangements are judged to have passed the competition test. A specific competition test, if that is the appropriate phraseology, for the bus sector is preferable to the application of the general competition law and is likely to act as less of a deterrent to co-operation between operators and local transport authorities for the benefit of passengers.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000042"></a>The amendments would broaden the scope of the benefits of voluntary and statutory quality partnership schemes in that Schedule 10 competition test and refer to,</p>
<ul><a name="07121287000079"></a>&#147;securing improvements in the quality, capacity, usability or variety of transport provision within the area of the authority of benefit to actual or potential transport users&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121287000072"></a>What is in here is rather broader than the terminology that appears to be in the amended version of the Schedule 10 competition test, and it is more appropriate to be able to take into account those rather wider considerations that might be deemed to outweigh the disadvantages of reduced competition. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121287000043"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0007.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="07121287000095"></a>The Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b> My noble friend Lady Scott had indicated her intention to oppose the Question that the schedule stand part of the Bill.

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000045"></a>In the package of draft guidance that we published to inform the debates, the largest single volume is the one that the Office of Fair Trading and the Department for Transport, working together, have provided, dealing with competition aspects of quality partnership schemes and voluntary agreements. While much traditional OFT guidance has been aimed at warning undertakings of what they cannot do, this tries to be far more positive in its approach and encourages bus operators to take full advantage of what they can do. I would like to think that that is a step forward that, I am sure, will be greatly welcomed by local authorities and bus operators.</p>
<h5><a name="07121287000082"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000046"></a>The main purpose of Schedule 2 is to introduce a new variant of the competition test relating to voluntary agreements and other agreements referred to as supporting agreements. This will become the Part 2 test. The existing test in the Transport Act 2000 will therefore be Part 1. That Part 1 test applies to the exercise of certain functions by a local transport authority, rather than to the actions of a bus operator.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000047"></a>In designing the Part 2 test, we took as our starting point the criteria that were already in the Part 1 test: that the public interest purposes to be balanced against any adverse effect on competition should be as follows:</p>
<ul><a name="07121287000080"></a>&#147;securing improvements in the quality of vehicles or facilities used for or in connection with the provision of local services ...  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>securing other improvements in local services of benefit to users of local services, and ... reducing or limiting traffic congestion, noise or air pollution.&#148;</ul>
<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000048"></a>My noble friend&#146;s amendment would add to that all manner of other criteria, which seem to cover virtually anything that could possibly be put in a quality partnership scheme or an agreement, and probably many other things beside. There are two main issues about the amendments. First, I am not convinced that they add anything of substance to the three existing criteria. They are simply examples of things that could be of benefit to transport users, which would be covered by the second and third existing criteria.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000049"></a>Secondly, the amendment text refers to &#147;transport provision&#148; and &#147;transport users&#148;, rather than the users of buses. Those are very broad terms that appear to be capable of covering all forms of transport, public and private. That change would not appear to be relevant to the provisions in the Transport Act 2000, with one possible exception, because Schedule 10 relates specifically to bus-related schemes and agreements. So I cannot see how the power to make such schemes or agreements could, say, be used to improve the quality of train services. The only function to which the revised words might have any application is in the making and varying of ticketing schemes, which may be multi-modal. The majority of such schemes are already subject to different competition rules because of the block exemption provisions.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000050"></a>Nor do I see that the words &#147;actual or potential&#148; users add anything. The schedule applies to the proposed exercise of a function as well as its actual exercise, so by its nature that must extend to potential users as well as actual ones&#151;real ones and virtual ones.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000051"></a>I therefore conclude that there is nothing necessary in the amendments; they could probably be confusing. I have already been pressed today on there being confusion where we need transparency and clarity, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. For those reasons, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendments. We can fairly argue that the objectives that he seeks are already achieved by what is in the Bill.</p>

</ul>
<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000058"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving the amendment, I am fully conscious that we discussed more or less the same amendment, or a similar one, a matter of months ago when the Concessionary Bus Travel Act was going through your Lordships&#146; House. It is very appropriate that I am moving the amendment today, because everything else that we are talking about is liable to collapse if we do not sort this matter out. In fact, I have been to a crisis meeting in Essex this morning.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000059"></a>If anything, as I have just said, the issues that this amendment seeks to address are even more pressing five months after that last discussion. Things have worsened, and I will explain what has happened, particularly in two-tier areas where district councils administer this concessionary scheme. I say immediately that we all support the principles behind the Bill of allowing more concessionary travel for troubled people across the country.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000060"></a>We must be clear on the whole cost of introducing the national scheme. The Government have moved to a free pass from a half-fare pass without really understanding what the total costs and take-up of the scheme would be. The resources identified nationally for 2008-09 are insufficient to support the additional costs of the bus companies, or for local transport authorities to operate the scheme. The Government have failed to recognise the popularity of the scheme and are refusing to absorb the costs if more people use the scheme than they originally estimated, and have failed to recognise the inflationary pressures within the system. Bus operators are also suggesting that fares may rise during 2008 and that present levels of reimbursement are inadequate. This will lead to even higher bills for local councils.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000061"></a>Under the current arrangements, the financial shortfall of the national scheme will fall on the council tax payer. In Essex, for example, we now estimate that the costs will be an additional &#163;8 million in 2008-09. Indeed, in my own county, the leaders of all 12 district councils&#151;that is cross-party&#151;together with Southend have come together to persuade the Government to take note of the issue and its grave potential impact on other services. That is happening across the country. To illustrate, one district council in Essex will have a shortfall of &#163;500,000. A 1 per cent rise in council tax raises about &#163;70,000, so to raise &#163;500,000 it will have to put 6 per cent or something on council tax, which it obviously cannot do. Another district council has got &#163;100,000 profit from the government allocation. Obviously, it will not put that into the pot to help other district councils. Everywhere in Essex I have been this week there is little talk about anything else.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000062"></a>There are an increasing number and length of bus journeys now being taken. Estimates are that over 40 per cent of all passengers are now using concessionary fare travel, and it is predicted that this will increase even further. The rules of reimbursement of bus operators have become highly complex, leading to disputes between councils and operators which the Government have failed to resolve. This means that when the picture  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>becomes clearer the final costs of the scheme could be even higher in Essex than the &#163;8 million we are predicting for next year.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000063"></a>I have a number of specific questions for the Minister. The situation is grave. What represents an acceptable level of additional costs? What constitutes an appropriate level of reimbursement for revenue foregone by the operator so that they are neither better nor worse off than they would have been? Will the Government, as they undertook to do when we discussed doing this legislation, fully fund it? If a district council or any authority is above the statutory minimum determined by the Department for Transport, it is that council&#146;s choice. Authorities are concerned about the statutory minimum costs.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000064"></a>The situation is grave. It is now leading to continued conflict between operators and local councils, with everyone threatening to sue everyone else. The whole problem threatens to undermine the new programme, which comes out on 1 April next year. It is a serious matter, and perhaps the Minister might think this is slightly out of kilter with current legislation, but it is so relevant because it affects the whole operation of the bus services&#151;particularly where there are two-tier areas and small authorities with no ability to raise any quantity of money. I beg to move.</p>

Given where they live, I guess that they will be more likely than most to be using a bus pass. As the noble Lord said, reimbursement was discussed not long ago and certainly at length during the passage of the Concessionary Bus Travel Bill, which received Royal Assent in July. Operators are reimbursed for carrying concessionaires according to the objective that they should be no better or no worse off. Operators are entitled to reimbursement for certain additional costs over and above the basic operating costs; for example, if extra costs are incurred by providing additional services or larger vehicles to cope with rising demand. We are not afraid of rising demand. We want to see more people using buses.</p>

<p><a name="07121287000069"></a>I agree that the national bus concession should be properly funded. The Government are providing a further &#163;212 million to local authorities in England,  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through a special grant, from April next year. That is in addition to the existing funding provided by central government through the formula grant process. Following the introduction of the national bus concession next April, the Government will provide approximately &#163;1 billion a year for statutory concessionary fares. No Government have ever been more generous in this regard. I am pleased to hear from the noble Lord that the party opposite shares our enthusiasm for this policy. We consulted with local authorities on the formula distribution of the special grant funding to ensure that it is targeted to meet the extra costs of reimbursement. We are confident that the total to be distributed is sufficient, based as it is on generous assumptions about fares, pass take-up, extra journeys and additional costs.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000070"></a>I fully understand the concerns that arise over any formula distribution of funding. However, this amendment would oblige central government to underwrite fully the cost for deals done by local authorities with bus operators. That would pass all risk to the taxpayer while leaving control with the local authority. I am not sure that that is exactly what my noble friend intended. I know that he is a strong localist, but were he in the position that I occupy, or in the position that the bus Minister at the Department for Transport occupies, I am not sure that he would want to pass over that responsibility in quite the same way. There is no incentive in the proposal to fight fraud or to negotiate hard with bus operators the overall cost of concessionary travel. Inevitably, it would lead to significant increases. Authorities could also use the concessionary reimbursement as a back door for subsidising marginal routes, again at the expense of the national taxpayer. I would question the desirability of that strategy.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121287000071"></a>We acknowledge that the current arrangements for concessionary fares reimbursement are not perfect, which is why we are working with operators and local authorities to put in place revised and more efficient arrangements for the national bus concession from April next year. It is vital that we secure the best deal for the taxpayer in taking this work forward. Those interests have to be understood and properly represented. I cannot accept the amendment. I accept that there may be difficulties in some parts, but we will continue, as we have throughout the introduction of this policy, to talk to our colleagues in local government and to work with bus operators to secure the best possible outcome and the best possible deal. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdrawn his amendment.</p>

There was the potential, as there is now, for running it through district councils in two-tier areas, but there was also the potential of county councils running it. Obviously, county councils have much more resources for raising money than district councils, because of their size. One district council, my district council of Chelmsford, has a deficit of nearly &#163;500,000. That is the council that is

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000003"></a>It is dissolving into chaos. I know that all sorts of letters have been written asking to see the Secretary of State and so on this week as the problem begins to unravel. Therefore, I am not at all happy with the Minister's answer. The whole thing is collapsing in front of us because the district council cannot cope with it. Perhaps we could go back to the solution of the Government operating a national scheme. Although I was opposed to that in the first place, that might be the best way to do it. It was suggested during the course of the legislation. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that aspect.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000005"></a>I certainly appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s point about county councils having the size and capacity to manage such budget issues. I have heard the complaints in my county as well, where it is said that councils such as Wealden are making &#147;a bit of a profit&#148; out of this, whereas the more heavily populated urban areas such as Brighton and Hove, and perhaps Eastbourne and Worthing, have similar difficulties to those that the noble Lord describes. I accept that the formula is not absolutely perfect, but it is the mechanism for distribution and it has a long history to it. When the noble Lord&#146;s party was in government, their Government obliged authorities to operate within its rigours, and I guess that that is what we are going to have to do here. We continue to listen to what our friends in local government have to say on the matter and, as I outlined in my response, we seek to perfect the operation of the scheme as it kicks in from April next year.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000006"></a>I am not going to be drawn into making comments about the desirability or otherwise of using a national mechanism. I am sure that powerful arguments were made that it could work locally, for the simple reason that local people are closer to where the service is being used and they probably have a better understanding of how it will operate. For those reasons, I will not be drawn any further into that debate, but I give the assurance that we in government continue to listen to understandable concerns and that we have the opportunity to see how it works out as it is implemented from April next year.</p>

<p><a name="07121292000012"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is further to the discussion that we had in the previous Committee sitting allowing registration restrictions within quality partnerships to include restrictions on the proposed length of operation of a new service.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000013"></a>If a proposed service is questioned because of the disruptive effect that it may have on the market, requiring a service to be operated for a minimum length of time may be an effective means of assuring stability. Giving the traffic commissioner the ability to do this could prove to be an effective compromise in place of rejecting an application.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000014"></a>In response to our Amendment No. 12 last week, the Minister spoke mainly about why he thought this amendment would not work with the variation or withdrawal of services. I can understand that varying a service may be useful, such as when co-ordinating with rail timetables, but I emphasise that what I mean by this amendment is the registration of new services and the period of their operation, with or without minor timetabling variations. I beg to move</p>

<p><a name="07121292000015"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07121292000081"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> We are a bit puzzled by some of the reasoning behind the amendment. If a traffic commissioner is called on to decide whether a proposed registration is detrimental to a quality partnership scheme, he or she will decide that it is or is not detrimental following consultation with the relevant local authorities and operators. If it is decided that it is not detrimental, the commissioner must accept the application and register the service. If the commissioner is persuaded that it would be detrimental, he or she can either refuse it outright or ask for it to be amended in some other way. I do not see how amending it to require the service to be operated for a minimum period would in most cases be compatible with a decision that the registration would be detrimental in the first place.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000016"></a>The provisions already contained in the Bill, if enacted, will enable an authority to introduce a registration restriction, which stipulates that services within the area of the scheme should be operated as registered for a minimum period. However, there might be services for which a shorter registration period would be appropriate&#151;for example, a tourist service that operates only during the summer holidays. If such a condition were to be in place, the traffic commissioner could accept only an application to operate for a shorter period or to vary or withdraw a service after such a period of time as the relevant authorities and operators were content. Any subsequent failure by the operator

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000017"></a>The other option would be for the Secretary of State to make regulations under the Transport Act 1985 to impose a longer notice period for registrations in the areas where a quality partnership scheme is in place. This is an option that the department will consider in consultation with others in due course, but that would be a rather more rigid approach, which would apply everywhere, whereas the imposition of registration conditions would give each area much greater flexibility.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000018"></a>We conclude that the amendment is unnecessary and that the options that I believe the noble Lord wishes to have available are probably already in the Bill. I hope that that explanation helps the noble Lord, and more particularly I hope that it helps him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07121292000024"></a>The noble Lord said: The Bill&#146;s proposals for the registration of new services under a quality contracts scheme are different from the potential restrictions available under a quality partnership scheme. The Bill seeks to make the rejection of such applications the norm and the acceptance the exception, determined by a clearance certificate provided by the relevant local transport authorities. Although I have made it sufficiently clear that I do not think that quality contracts are particularly beneficial, or even that many people will take them up, I can see that barring some applications for registration would make sense under such schemes if things were to work as planned.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000025"></a>In most cases, having new services registered alongside would undermine the network planned by the local authority under a quality contracts framework. However, operators obviously usually make applications for commercial reasons. A route suggested by an operator can usually be expected to have sufficient customers if the operator has done the necessary research. As such, that quality contracts procedure could benefit from having this valuable information fed into the discussion. It would therefore make good sense for local transport authorities to have a mechanism for taking suggestions on board and allowing quality contracts to be made in collaboration with operators.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000026"></a>The initial setting up of a scheme requires extensive consultation, but transport needs change. Having operators as an extra resource to help authorities in subsequent periods to determine their transport needs under a quality contracts scheme would help the scheme to be a success. More people might take it up. I have suggested in my amendment that the role could be taken up by the traffic commissioners, who could give an authority guidance to incorporate a service into their quality contract if he saw fit. The Minister might have other ideas as to how this might be done. I simply wanted to raise the issue of the operator not having much input into the process after a scheme was set up, especially if quality contracts are to be continued beyond the initial 10 years. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121292000027"></a><b><a name="71212-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121292000084"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> This is an intriguing amendment for one or two reasons that I shall illuminate. In a quality contracts scheme, the traffic commissioner in essence has a passive role. The role of enforcing compliance with the terms of a quality contract, for example, falls to the local transport authority rather than to the commissioner. All the commissioner can do under existing legislation is penalise an operator who runs a service in a quality contracts area without the authority&#146;s permission.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000028"></a>Clause 43 was introduced to give operators an opportunity to register services in addition to those provided under the quality contracts scheme. It would be entirely for the authority to decide whether the service could go ahead. The traffic commissioner would merely register any service that the authority was willing to accept. This is a rather less bureaucratic alternative than giving the authority the power to issue permits for additional services, as Transport for London does in London under the Greater London Authority Act 1999. It was never the Government&#146;s intention that the traffic commissioner should interfere in the decision whether a particular service should be part of a quality contracts scheme or be allowed to operate outside that scheme.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000029"></a>What intrigues and surprises me is that the proposal embodied in the amendment would run counter to upholding the right of local authorities to take their own decisions. I am really rather intrigued as to why the noble Lord, with his local government hat on, has come up with a scheme that would provide the traffic commissioner with what some might see as a rather dangerous, interfering role. Is that really what the noble Lord wants? I am not quite sure why he wants to do that.</p>

<p><a name="07121292000037"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 63 would update and increase the flexibility of the fee regime that applies to the registration of local bus services. This regime has remained unchanged for the past 20 years. It would provide a more equitable fee structure for different types of operator and route. It also would provide the Secretary of State with a further option for funding any additional costs incurred by the traffic commissioners, for example, relating to the proposed punctuality regime, from the industry. It does not mean that we would definitely do so; that debate is for another day.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000038"></a>If, for example, we were to raise fees to cover some additional traffic commissioner enforcement&#151;this is only for argument&#151;under the current arrangements for charging fees in connection with bus service registrations, only a proportion of operators would bear those costs. Punctuality enforcement benefits all operators, yet charges would hit only those operators who have either registered new services or varied existing ones. Cancellation of services has a transaction cost, though there is currently no charge. In addition, it seems reasonable to charge a fee for a registration to continue in force, much in the way that a holder of a PSV operator&#146;s licence pays a regular fee for the ongoing validity of that licence.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000039"></a>It has been suggested on many occasions that if the traffic commissioners are to carry out additional work, they will necessarily require more resources. Clearly, there are two ways of funding that: either through the department and therefore taxation, or through the industry. I understand that the bus industry might be nervous at viewing this new power. However, I stress that further work needs to be carried out on the additional resources needed, and no decision has been taken on how much, if any, of that burden should fall to the industry. A well-run and modern industry should be able to manage the costs associated with competing in the market, including any regulatory or enforcement costs.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000040"></a>I do not currently have an estimate of how much any additional work might cost, but I do not expect it to be excessive. The detailed work on the arrangements for the bus punctuality regime is still taking place, in particular through the Bus Partnership Forum, and that work will consider the level of any necessary

I also assure Members of the Committee that any changes to the fees regime would be subject to consultation. We are in a position where we are anticipating possible future changes and ensuring that the appropriate statutory powers are available should a particular option be decided on. I stress that the final details have not yet been determined. This is simply an opportunity to bring in some additional flexibility to the fee powers and to make them more fit for purpose in today&#146;s world. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07121292000045"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 63B and 64A. All these amendments deal with the traffic commissioners&#146; judgment in determining whether a service is not being operated &#147;as registered&#148; and the measures available to rectify such problems.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000046"></a>We welcome the highlighting of the punctuality issue and its effect on passengers&#146; perception of local bus services. It seems desirable to allow the traffic commissioner to investigate the root causes of such issues and prepare reports to make suggestions for improvement for both the authorities and the operators.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000047"></a>My point in Amendment No. 63A concerns the initial judgment by the traffic commissioners. It should be remembered that this is one of the commissioners&#146; quasi-judicial functions, which we have discussed. If the traffic commissioner network is populated by competent individuals who are knowledgeable about transport matters&#151;a point that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, raised&#151;this should provide no problems. However, as it stands, the Bill gives no guidance about the circumstances in which a traffic commissioner can deem a local service to be operated &#147;not as registered&#148;. Specifically, no mention is given of the timeframe that such observances should take. I would like to think that any problem should persist over a period of time, with due regard to exceptional circumstances and other situational details, before action is taken by a traffic commissioner. The Minister may say that this is a matter for guidance but, without provision being made in the Bill, the potential exists for a traffic commissioner to exercise poor judgment.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000048"></a>Where a problem is identified with a particular service, the Bill allows traffic commissioners to publish a report containing remedial measures to be implemented by operators and local traffic authorities. Amendment No. 63B would ensure that this report was consistent with any local transport policy that might be affected by the measures. This will ensure electoral accountability and also that any advice is not at odds with the other plans that a local authority may have.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0008.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000049"></a>Furthermore, if the advice is to be effective, it should be reasonably practicable to implement and have regard for the other pressures that authorities

I speak here only for authorities but I am sure that bus operators would like the same considerations to be made from their point of view.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71212-gc0009.htm"/>


<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000050"></a>Advice should be in proportion to the problem faced. I am certain that many suggestions can be made to improve punctuality, but there needs to be acknowledgement that they should offer value for money. The traffic commissioner network is perhaps not the best judge of what is affordable to local authorities, and I can envisage that advice might not be sensible in some cases. If recommendations are undeliverable, they will be meaningless.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000051"></a>Clause 55 makes revision to the section of the Transport Act 2000 that deals with penalties, although I believe that these have now been renamed &#147;sanctions&#148; by virtue of the last subsection of the clause. The idea of traffic commissioners fining operators in the event of poor performance seems reasonable, and the Bill allows traffic commissioners a wider range of options than at present. The idea that money can be returned to benefit bus services and passengers is more favourable than simply fining operators, under which passengers might see an increase in the fares that they pay.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000052"></a>However, the revisions to the subsection of the Transport Act that deals with the amounts of such penalties provide no more clarity to the situation. At present, paragraph (a) of the subsection stipulates that operators can be fined up to &#163;550 per vehicle. However, paragraph (b) of the same subsection is somewhat vaguer and allows the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to specify another amount. I am unclear how this may work in practice, and it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify exactly what that means.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000053"></a>As the Bill revises and increases the powers available to the traffic commissioners where services are not operated as registered, this matter needs to be addressed. I believe that there needs to be some guidance, otherwise the powers could be used in an unpredictable or inconsistent manner. That could have the unintended consequence of passengers thinking that they had received a worse deal in one part of the county compared with another. Guidance could take the form of a penalty policies statement published by the traffic commissioners in advance. This would provide clarity to operators and ensure that the penalty system functioned as intended, with consistency given to traffic commissioners&#146; decisions. I beg to move.</p>

Perhaps we expect too much sometimes.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000055"></a>The first amendment would limit the circumstances in which the traffic commissioner could formally engage with a local traffic authority to cases where bus punctuality had been consistently poor over a period of time. Where a bus operator is faced with a licence sanction for poor performance under Section 26 of the Transport Act 1985, the traffic commissioner has to be satisfied  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC172"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column GC172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that there is no reasonable excuse and that the conduct involves either danger or frequent failure. The situation here, however, is rather different. The events described in subsection (1)(a) of new Section 27A, which the clause will insert into the Transport Act 1985, will trigger not disciplinary action against the bus operator but engagement with the local traffic authority.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000056"></a>The Government continue to work with stakeholders to develop a robust regime for managing bus punctuality. The stakeholders are keen to encourage such engagement to begin at an earlier stage, for example where operators identify a traffic problem and encounter difficulties in keeping to a timetable without actually failing to meet the punctuality standards. They would like to use the tripartite process of commissioner, authority and operator to nip potential problems in the bud rather than to wait for them to become manifest. The Government fully support that in principle but consider that there is no need to spell it all out in legislation. There is nothing to prevent the three parties meeting to discuss these matters and developing strategies to prevent them getting worse. However, the existence of stronger legislative powers if the situation does get out of control would spur them to do so. Clause 54 will provide that spur and give the traffic commissioner sufficient teeth to act when appropriate. The amendment, however, would pull in the other direction and would in effect deter the traffic commissioner from taking steps unless things were in a very poor state indeed. In practice, the traffic commissioners will use their judgment and common sense, as they usually do, and the clause gets the balance about right.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000057"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s second amendment moves in the other direction. It aims to limit the type of remedial measure that the traffic commissioner could recommend to the local traffic authority in his report under new Section 27A(4). It is clearly our intention that any remedial measures recommended should be reasonably practicable to implement and consistent with the local transport plan, so far as that plan goes into such a level of detail, or at least not inconsistent with it. However, I am not persuaded that we need these words in the legislation. In practice, traffic commissioners recognise that they are not experts in traffic management techniques and would be most unlikely to make a recommendation that had not been discussed with representatives from the local authority and accepted by them as a reasonably practicable step that they could take that would not have adverse impact on any of their other traffic management objectives. They are also under a general obligation to exercise their functions in a way that is reasonable and rational. It is not necessary to spell it out in detail in legislation, as the noble Lord suggests.</p>

<p><a name="07121292000058"></a>The third amendment in this group is most odd. It affects an order-making power of the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers to amend the maximum penalty which a traffic commissioner can impose on an operator under Section 155 of the Transport Act 2000. At present, that sum is &#163;550 for each vehicle that the operator is authorised to operate under any of the PSV operators&#146; licences. There will of course be more than one if the operator has operating centres in more than one traffic area.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000059"></a>The order-making power simply enables a Minister to substitute a different figure for &#163;550. The order is by statutory instrument, and any proposed use of the power would be subject to consultation. It would be most bizarre for the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers to be obliged to issue guidance in advance, setting out how they proposed to use the power, which would be the effect of the amendment. I see no value in that at all. It would appear to be asking Ministers to fetter their own discretion, or that of their successors, in a way which, if the noble Lord sat back and thought about it, would be most unsatisfactory.</p>

<a name="71212-gc0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121292000060"></a>The amendments seem to go in different directions. The last amendment is most strange in terms of what it seeks to achieve. Perhaps the noble Lord sees it as a probing amendment, but I am not quite sure what the noble Lord is seeking to find as a result. I am not persuaded by the amendment, and I ask him to think about them carefully and to withdraw them.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="07121263000002"></a>Automatic Teller Machine Charges</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="07121263000014"></a><b><a name="71212-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121263000113"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher) has made the following Written Statement.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07121263000015"></a>Following the March 2005 Treasury Committee report on ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) charging, the Treasury invited the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, the right honourable John McFall, to chair a working group on ATMs to take forward work on key issues. The working group, which included banks, independent ATM operators and consumer groups, published its report on 13 December 2006.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07121263000016"></a>The working group announced an agreement to provide around 600 new free cash machines across 1,707 target low-income areas that it identified as lacking convenient access to these machines. To achieve this, a market-based financial incentive&#151;known as a &#147;financial inclusion premium&#148;&#151;was introduced, to encourage ATM operators to place or retain free ATMs in deprived areas with a low expected volume of transactions. The working group also agreed to implement improved transparency rules for charging cash machines.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07121263000017"></a>The Government are pleased to report that, almost a year on from the publication of the working group&#146;s report, the industry has made excellent progress towards its goals of placing around 600 non-charging machines in low-income areas across the UK, with more than 2 million individuals on low incomes standing to benefit.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07121263000018"></a>As of 23 November 2007, sites for 543 of the 600 new ATMs required have been identified. Of these, 337 new free machines are already in use, with 63 per cent of these ATMs based in deprived areas and receiving the &#147;financial inclusion premium&#148;. Encouragingly, five of these new cash machines have proved so popular that their level of withdrawals means that they have now graduated from the &#147;financial inclusion premium&#148; scheme.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07121263000019"></a>Banks, building societies and independent ATM operators have all contributed new free-to-use cash machines; independent ATM operators have provided or are in the process of supplying around 40 per cent of the confirmed new non-charging ATMs. The UK ATM network, LINK, is continuing to work with its member banks and ATM operators to identify suitable sites in the remaining target areas, and is engaging closely in this exercise with Members of Parliament, local authorities, consumer councils and landlords.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07121263000020"></a>The benefits in terms of financial inclusion are clear. Data from LINK suggest that the new ATMs currently in operation or under contract will enable 1,190,474 residents in the target low-income areas to access cash more conveniently and manage their money more effectively.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07121263000021"></a>In terms of improved transparency, all operators of cash machines that charge users for withdrawals have met the end-June 2007 deadline to improve the on-screen standards of &#147;at a glance&#148; signage. This means that it is clear to a consumer when a charge is applied when withdrawing cash. Good progress is also being made by operators to enhance external signage by end-December 2007.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07121263000022"></a>The Government are encouraged by the substantial progress achieved, and would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those involved in extending free access to cash to those who need it most.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07121263000023"></a>Full details about progress made is available on the LINK internet website at <a href="http://www.link.co.uk/atm/access">www.link.co.uk/atm/access</a> _to_cash_progress/index.html.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07121263000025"></a>In their consultation paper on the law on damages which was published on 4 May 2007, the Government announced their intention to increase the level of bereavement damages awarded under Section 1A of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 every three years for inflation in line with the Retail Prices Index, rounded to the nearest &#163;100, and that the first such increase would be made later in the year. Bereavement damages were last increased from &#163;7,500 to &#163;10,000 on 1 April 2002.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07121263000026"></a>To give effect to this, my right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has laid before Parliament an order increasing the level of bereavement damages awarded under Section 1A of the Fatal Accidents Act from &#163;10,000 to &#163;11,800. An order has also been laid under Article 3A(5) of the Fatal Accidents (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 to make the same increase in the level of the award in Northern Ireland. The orders will take effect from 1 January 2008, and the increased level of the award will apply to all causes of action which accrue on or after that date.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07121263000028"></a>The Community Development Foundation will be the lead national partner for Grassroots Grants, the Government's programme to help develop and sustain the grant funding available to small community organisations in England.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07121263000029"></a>The final report of the review of <I>The future role of the third sector in social and economic regeneration</I> (Cmnd 7189) announced that, in addition to the &#163;80 million we will be making available for small grants to the community sector over the CSR period,  


<notus-date day="12" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS33"></a><b>12 Dec 2007 : Column WS33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we would also make &#163;50 million available in capital grants to local independent foundations to invest in endowment funds. These capital grants will generate income to support frontline organisations in the future and lever in additional money from the private sector on a matched basis. The allocation of &#163;130 million underlines the high importance which the Government attach to this strategy.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07121263000030"></a>This combined programme will be called Grassroots Grants. It will be targeted at improving the grant funding available to the smallest community organisations which play a vital role in building strong and active communities. It will be delivered locally by independent local funders with good knowledge of their local communities and the ability to reach out and engage both small community organisations and donors.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07121263000031"></a>The Community Development Foundation, as lead national partner, will be responsible for running a selection process to identify and appoint the local funders. It will also manage the programme once the local funders have been appointed. CDF has considerable understanding of the community sector in England and experience of managing grant programmes. The appointment is being made under a framework agreement for the provision of grant administration services which the Government have with CDF and other service providers.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07121263000032"></a>CDF will open the application process to select local funders in January and applications will be invited by April. Appointments of local funders will be made in June. Full details of the application process and the programme will be announced in January.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07121263000034"></a>The Home Office has today published a summary of responses to the consultation paper, <I>Banning Offensive Weapons</I>, which sought views on further measures to restrict the supply of weapons which are being used in violent crime.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07121263000035"></a>The Government's primary concern is public safety and Ministers have concluded from the consultation that banning the sale, hire and import of samurai swords is necessary to better protect local communities, and will make an important contribution to our wider strategy to tackle violent crime.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07121263000037"></a>In reaching a conclusion to proceed with banning these weapons we have taken into account both responses to the consultation paper and the views expressed in a larger amount of correspondence which we have received since we first raised the possibility of amending the offensive weapons order. We will seek to protect the legitimate use of samurai swords by certain groups through enforceable exemptions and defences.</p>

<a name="07121263000039"></a><b><a name="71212-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07121263000117"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for International Development (Baroness Vadera):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Gareth Thomas) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07121263000040"></a>I represented the UK for the session on economic partnership agreements (EPAs) at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 10 December 2007. The Foreign Secretary attended all other sessions for the UK.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07121263000041"></a>Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Development Commissioner Louis Michel represented the European Commission and gave an update on negotiations and proposed that the council approve Regulation 2007 0205/ACC. The Commission confirmed that to date 17 countries had signed a goods-only economic partnership agreement and reported that there is a good possibility that Ghana, Cameroon, Gabon, Namibia and the Caribbean will sign agreements in the coming week. The Commission believed that the recent progress was due to its flexibility and generosity and the approaching external deadline of 31 December 2006 when the Cotonou agreement, which governs current trade relations between the ACP and EU, will expire.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07121263000042"></a>Our objective at the council was to continue to maximise the development benefits of EPAs, in particular to protect the duty- and quota-free access from 1 January and the liberalised rules of origin offer from amendment, while also ensuring that no ACP country has worse market access from 1 January. The UK made the first intervention and called on the council and Commission to ensure that poor countries do not face tariff increases as of 1 January 2007. The UK also urged negotiations to continue over the coming days and for further discussions to take place at a council meeting next week. We also welcomed President Barroso&#146;s recent commitment to review progress on EPAs in the new year and the Commission&#146;s unwillingness to adversely amend the duty-and quota-free access and rules of origin offers.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07121263000043"></a>This stance was supported by the Netherlands which also argued for a debate at future councils before the end of the year. Ireland took a similar view. However, a series of other member states noted their support for immediate approval of the regulation as of 10 December. The presidency concluded therefore that the council adopted the regulation on EPAs, which formalises the market access offer of 100 per cent duty-free quota-free market access to the EU with improved rules of origin for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that have signed WTO-compatible agreements.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="07121263000044"></a>The UK, along with the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland, therefore made a declaration setting out our continued concern for non-LDCs which have not yet initialled an agreement and urged the Commission

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="07121263000045"></a>The Commission stated it will continue negotiations with other countries and that those ACP countries which sign agreements before the end of 2007 will also benefit from this improved access to the EU from 1 January. The Commission will report back to the General Affairs and External Relations Council in January 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="07121263000047"></a>I am today announcing the next stage in the review of the law of homicide.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="07121263000048"></a>In July 2005, the Law Commission was asked by the Government to review the law of murder in England and Wales.  In December 2006, it published its report, <I>Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide</I>, with wide-ranging recommendations for changes to the law.  That report was intended as the first stage in the review of the law, with the Government undertaking the second stage.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="07121263000049"></a>It is that second stage which begins today.  The Government have considered the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations carefully and have decided to proceed on a step-by-step basis, looking first at the recommendations for:</p>
reformed partial defences to murder of diminished responsibility and provocation (including the use of excessive force in self-defence);reformed offences of complicity in relation to homicide; and improved procedures for dealing with infanticide. 
<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="07121263000050"></a>The Government believe it is right to deal with these crucial elements of the existing law before moving on to consider the wider structural proposals from the Law Commission.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="07121263000051"></a>We want the review to be open and transparent.  Over the next few months we will be talking to key stakeholders, both inside and outside the criminal justice system, to seek their views on the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations in these areas.  We will publish draft clauses for consultation next summer prior to introducing any necessary legislation.</p>

To increase the supply of social housing over the next three years, we are today confirming allocations totalling &#163;8.4 billion to be shared across the regions. We will be allocating &#163;8.4 billion across the regions over the next three years. Every single region is getting at least a 5 per cent increase every year over the next three years&#151;with areas of greatest need receiving far more than that. The Housing Corporation and, later, the Homes and Communities Agency will be tasked with spending this money most effectively.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="07121263000056"></a>We will also be investing &#163;2.4 billion in the ALMO programme over the next three years. We expect that this will bring a further 150,000 homes up to standard. A further four ALMOs are joining the programme today, from Charnwood, North East Derbyshire, Stevenage and Redbridge. A further &#163;200 million will support ALMOs already on the programme which have yet to pass their inspections. We are continuing to assess the remaining round 6 funding bids and will allocate further programme places to ALMOs as individual funding allocations are finalised.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="07121263000057"></a>We will also be writing to all stock-owning authorities announcing the 2008 housing transfer programme. This will enable local authorities and their tenants, if they wish, the opportunity to transfer ownership of their stock to a housing association to bring in private sector funding needed for further improvements in housing, to build on the decent homes investment that has taken place, and for estate transformation schemes.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="07121263000058"></a>Finally, almost &#163;2 billion from the regional housing pot will fund improvements to local authority-owned and private sector stock.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="07121263000060"></a>The Housing and Regeneration Bill is creating a new regulatory framework, responding directly to Martin Cave&#146;s recommendation that tenants should have a greater say over where they live and how their homes are managed.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="07121263000061"></a>This new framework will reward performance and innovation, giving greater freedom to good housing associations. The new regulator will have a range of powers to intervene where tenants&#146; needs are not being met.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="07121263000062"></a>Initially, the regulator will only have the power to regulate registered social landlords. But in response to demand across the sector, we are committed to extending this new framework to local authorities as rapidly as possible. So I have asked Professor Ian Cole of Sheffield University to work with all key stakeholders in establishing the detail of how this will work in practice, and align with the new performance framework for local government.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="07121263000063"></a>We will also be conducting a review of the housing revenue account subsidy (HRAS) system. I have provided a separate Written Statement to the House on this review.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="07121263000064"></a><I>Improving housing services, mobility and choice</I></p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="07121263000065"></a>We know that the most successful local authorities offer their tenants not only a housing service, but housing options&#151;a service which is more responsive to individual need and to changes in individual circumstances. We also know that the system is not meeting the needs of too many groups at the moment&#151;often due to a lack of mobility in the system. So I am setting out a package of measures to promote greater mobility for social housing tenants.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="07121263000066"></a>We will be investing &#163;1.8 million which will deliver 18 new choice-based lettings schemes offering people the chance to move across different local authorities. A further &#163;2 million investment in the next two years will enable all local authorities to be part of such a scheme by 2010.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="07121263000067"></a>We know that a major consequence of this lack of mobility is overcrowding&#151;a problem which blights the lives of thousands of families. As set out in the Children&#146;s Plan yesterday, we are committed to updating the standard by which we assess overcrowding. And we are today publishing an action plan to achieve that ambition, which has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Initial funding of &#163;15 million will tackle severe overcrowding across 38 pathfinders, including all London boroughs and five other hot spots&#151;Birmingham, Bradford, Leicester, Liverpool and Manchester. We estimate that these local authorities cover more than half of overcrowded households in the country. This work will help identify costs and the time needed before we roll this approach out across the country.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="07121263000068"></a>Elderly people, too, are often affected by the lack of mobility, if they want to move closer to their families or to smaller homes. So we will consult on changing the reasonable preference criteria to benefit older people who want to downsize.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="07121263000069"></a>Finally, there will be an independent, comprehensive review of the private rented sector and we will set out further details in the new year.</p>

More social tenants should have the opportunity to progress into homeownership. We have been running a pilot scheme known as social homebuy to offer those who cannot buy outright a stepping stone on to the property ladder. We will be continuing the pilots. Many tenants have been put off by the costs of taking on full maintenance, and so we will work with social landlords to develop options for shared maintenance costs before assessing the next steps to promote wider access to shared ownership among social tenants.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="07121263000079"></a>I am today announcing a review of the housing revenue account subsidy system to be led jointly by officials in my department and in HM Treasury, reporting to Ministers in both departments.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="07121263000080"></a>In the housing Green Paper, <I>Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable</I>, published in July, we said that we wanted to examine the case for change to the redistributive housing revenue account subsidy system. The purpose of the review is to ensure that we have a sustainable, long-term system for financing council housing and that this system is consistent with wider housing policy, including the establishment of a regulator of social housing.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="07121263000081"></a>This system should be fair to both tenants and taxpayers. It should be transparent, giving a clear and accurate picture of the balance of support from local and central government. It should enable delivery of agreed standards of service and accommodation. It should recognise that social rents should help tenants gain and retain work, while acknowledging the need for landlords to improve the quality and efficiency of services. And it should be affordable and not expose Government to unacceptable fiscal risks.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="07121263000082"></a>The review will build on the work of the pilots we have conducted with six local authorities which looked at the costs and benefits of councils operating outside the housing revenue account subsidy system. It will consider evidence about the need to spend on management, maintenance and repairs. It will consider rent policy, including the relationship between council

It will also consider how the self-financing model developed in the pilot exercise would fit with the aims of the review and, if it is consistent with these, how it could be implemented. And it will consider whether the rules which govern the operation of the HRA need to be changed in order to fit with a new system of financing.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="07121263000083"></a>The review will make its final report in spring 2009, setting out a way forward for the subsidy system, rents policy across all social housing, and spending needs for council housing. It will be followed by a period of consultation. This will enable its findings to be considered in the next spending review. It will also be asked to provide earlier advice in 2008 to inform decisions about council rents and subsidy determinations in the remaining two years of the current spending period.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="07121263000084"></a>The report will also support our aim of a single regulator for social housing across all providers by developing a policy framework of rents and standards for the regulator of social housing. This output will also be delivered in 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="07121263000087"></a>I wish to inform the House of a recent error in processing an application for Section 44 stop and search powers under the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="07121263000088"></a>The application by Sussex Police, dated 3 September 2007, did not follow the recognised procedure. Forces submit applications to the National Joint Unit (NJU) at the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) which are then sent to the Home Office for ministerial authorisation. This must occur within 48 hours of the request being signed by an officer of the rank of assistant chief constable or above&#151;commander in the MPS&#151;in the relevant force. In this case, due primarily to a process failure, the application was not passed to the Home Office for ministerial authorisation but the force continued to use the powers for the period up to 25 September when the next authorisation was submitted to the NJU. Sussex Police have confirmed that 259 stops and searches were carried out at Gatwick Airport during the unauthorised period. This relates to the period between the previous authorisation expiring and the next one being signed by the force.</p>

On 25 October I subsequently wrote to the new chief constable of Sussex police outlining my concern that this error had occurred. I also wrote to Lord Carlile in his role as the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. Lord Carlile replied on 9 November to indicate that he would be recording this incident in his annual review which I expect to be published in spring 2008. A note from ACPO (TAM)&#151;The Association of Chief Police Officers, Terrorism and Allied Matters Committee&#151;was disseminated to all forces on 14 November outlining the more robust Section 44 process.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="07121263000090"></a>No arrests occurred as a result of these stop and searches; however Sussex Police will shortly be writing to all of the individuals concerned to apologise. Since this error came to light, it has been brought to my attention that this is not the first time that Sussex Police have used these powers without proper authorisation. Regrettably, a similar incident occurred in June 2003. All steps have now been taken to ensure, with the NJU, that such regrettable and serious omissions do not occur again.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="07121263000091"></a>In light of this, Home Office officials are reviewing previous Section 44 authorisations to identify any other occasions where the power has been used in error.

A right of appeal exists in Section 10(l) and (3) of the 2005 Act against decisions by the Secretary of State to modify an obligation imposed by a non-derogating control order, without consent, and to refuse a request by a controlled person to modify any such obligation. Appeals have been made in respect of two modification requests that were refused. One modification appeal made by a controlled individual was heard on 25 September 2007 and it was dismissed by the High Court. The other modification appeal has not yet been heard.</p>

The House of Lords had heard the cases of JJ and others, MB, AF and E in July and considered both Articles 5 (Right to Liberty) and 6 (Right to a Fair Trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

It was held by a 3:2 majority that control orders with 18-hour curfews do amount to a breach of Article 5. The Home Secretary is disappointed that the House of Lords found against control orders containing 18-hour curfews which she feels is necessary, in certain circumstances, to protect national security. The Home Secretary believes that the ruling does, however, allow us to impose curfews of up to 16 hours.</p>

<a name="07121263000107"></a><b><a name="71212-wms0002.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="07121263000123"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Ivan Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="07121263000108"></a>Today the department is to launch a consultation on proposals for a strategic framework for funding and investment support to third sector organisations. The document has been placed in the Library and copies are available for honourable Members in the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="07121263000109"></a>The purpose of the review, informed through the consultation process, is to develop a framework for strategic investment in the sector by the department and transform the current, rather piecemeal, arrangements for funding the sector into a strategic portfolio of investments that will more explicitly support the delivery of the department&#146;s objectives and priorities for health and social care. This consultation document sets out the vision of a more strategic approach to the department&#146;s investment in the sector that reinforces the sector&#146;s value in a way that reflects the department&#146;s role in creating the conditions for innovation and improvement in service delivery across health and social care.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="07121263000110"></a>The consultation proposals are set in a coherent framework with four key objectives to:</p>
 allow more coherent investment;support evaluation of outcomes and benefits;increase value for money; andreinforce the sector&#146;s integral role
<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="07121263000111"></a>The consultation process will help to further the Government&#146;s aim of supporting the development of a strong and sustainable third sector, and will have the benefit of not only promoting and supporting the third sector&#146;s role in delivery of the health and social care agenda more effectively, but also promoting strong and sustainable communities through both community involvement and volunteering.</p>

<a name="71212-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="07121263000112"></a>The consultation will run until 20 March 2008 with a view to the department setting out proposals, based on the responses we receive to the consultation, in a document to be published in summer 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="07121295000047"></a>Our overall aims are to:</p>
increase the number of people drinking within the Government's sensible drinking guidelines;reduce the number of men who are drinking more than 50 units a week and the number of women who are drinking more than 35 units or more than twice the sensible daily drinking guidelines on a regular basis;reduce the number of under-18s who drink and the amount of alcohol they consume;ensure the laws and licensing powers we have introduced to tackle alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder, to protect young people and bear down on irresponsibly managed premises are being used effectively; andshape an environment which actively encourages sensible drinking. This will be delivered through partnership working, by ensuring existing laws and powers are being used effectively, and by reviewing the effectiveness of existing powers in areas such as promotion and pricing.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="07121295000048"></a>We undertook in <I>Safe.

The review will cover advertising, price discounting and its promotion, and links between these and harms to young drinkers and other groups. It will take account of the study recently published by Ofcom and the Advertising Standards Authority on the impact of the stricter controls on alcohol advertising introduced in 2005. The independent review is expected to report findings in July 2008.</p>

long-dated currency swap&#151;a level 3 input would include interest rates in a specified currency that are not observable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data at commonly quoted intervals or otherwise for substantially the full term of the currency swap. The interest rates in a currency swap are the swap rates calculated from the respective countries' yield curves;three-year option on exchange-traded shares&#151;a level 3 input would include historical volatility, that is, the volatility for the shares derived from the shares' historical prices. Historical volatility typically does not represent current market participant expectations about future volatility, even if it is the only information available to price an option;interest rate swap&#151;a level 3 input would include an adjustment to a mid-market consensus (non-binding) price for the swap developed using data that are not directly observable and that cannot otherwise be corroborated by observable market data;asset retirement obligation at initial recognition&#151;a level 3 input would include expected cash flows (adjusted for risk) developed using the reporting entity's own data if there is no information reasonably available without undue cost and effort that indicates that market participants would use different assumptions. That level 3 input would be used in a present value technique together with other inputs, for example (1) a risk-free interest rate or (2) a credit-adjusted risk-free rate if the effect of the reporting entity's credit standing on the fair value of the liability is reflected in the discount rate rather than in the expected cash flows; andreporting unit&#151;a level 3 input would include a financial forecast (for example, of cash flows or earnings) developed using the reporting entity's own data if there is no information reasonably available without undue cost and effort that indicates that market participants would use different assumptions.<a name="wa_subhd_12"></a>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_116"></a><a name="07121295000198"></a>As part of the project appraisal, Partnerships UK, one of the consultants advising on the project, recommended to EEDA that, in order to demonstrate the likely viability of the project, its funding of the outer harbour development should be subject to revenue commitments from a ferry operator being secured and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry made this a condition of his consent to EEDA to fund the project. The Minister for Regions, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, subsequently waived this condition, being satisfied with EEDA's judgment that the plans of the preferred developer were viable without such revenue guarantees. The private sector port developer will carry the risk of any revenue shortfall. The European Commission decided that the public funding for the maritime access works did not constitute state aid. At present no road or rail improvements are considered necessary in connection with this development.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_138"></a><a name="07121295000272"></a>As part of the early years foundation stage (EYFS)&#151;a single framework for learning, development and care for children from birth to age five, which will become statutory in all settings from September 2008)&#151;the physical development of babies and young children is one of the six areas of learning and development which practitioners must encourage, through play, and by providing opportunities for physical and recreational activities. Implementation of the EYFS is funded through grants for training and delivery primarily through the free offer for three and four year-olds.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_139"></a><a name="07121295000273"></a>This department has allocated &#163;135.5 million in 2006-07, &#163;150.5 million in 2007-08 and &#163;155.5 million in 2008-09 to deliver the national school sport strategy and its targets. DCMS has allocated &#163;44.75 million annually in 2006-07 and 2007-08 to deliver the strategy. The allocation for 2008-09 is being finalised. This investment has helped us to increase the proportion of children aged five-16 participating in high quality PE and school sport from 62 per cent in 2003-04 to 86 per cent in 2006-07, achieving our target for 2008 of 85 per cent a year early.</p>

<a name="71212w0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_140"></a><a name="07121295000276"></a>There is a clear role for the Government to play in acting as a &#147;critical friend&#148; to football, and in seeking to start useful debates around areas of concern across all levels of sport. However, it would not be right for the Government to seek to intervene in these issues directly. Whilst the Minister for Sport will continue to raise these issues in discussions with the football authorities, we have asked Mr Drasdo to raise his concerns directly with both the FA and supporters direct.</p>
