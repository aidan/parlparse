As the noble Baroness will know, a small number of newborns are vulnerable to strokes from intracranial bleeding, and are given vitamin K to prevent this. A large proportion of strokes in children occur in those with sickle cell, so we have implemented national antenatal and newborn screening.</p>

Is she aware that the Government's National Stroke Strategy for improving adult stroke care makes no mention of childhood stroke care? Is she also aware that 400 children in the United Kingdom succumb to stroke each year and that stroke is one of the top causes of death in childhood in the UK? It is likely that most stroke-affected children will be left with a disability of some sort. Does she agree that parents, family members and teachers should be made aware of stroke symptoms?</p>

The National Stroke Strategy does not refer to children because the majority of the annual 110,000 strokes occur to people over the age of 55. However, the main reason is that the clinical path for dealing with children who have strokes is quite different from that for adults. For example, a child who has sickle cell disease may

That is why we use the Royal College of Physicians' clinical guidelines on how to treat children with stroke. I read with interest that the Stroke Association has produced a manifesto for children with stroke. We are looking at that and I am very happy to answer questions on what we intend to do about the different proposals in that.</p>

One is awareness of the condition. The Government's FAST campaign has been very successful, so could they not do something similar for children? Parents and teachers do not know what the problem is. The other problem is that of misdiagnosis. Children taken to A&amp;E in time for an emergency scan are often sent away having been told they have an ear infection. There is a need for training of those receiving children in A&amp;E departments.</p>

I am not sure whether the case is yet made for a comparison with childhood cancer, but there is absolutely no doubt that, for those 420 cases, it is devastating both for the child and their family. We need to focus on making sure that diagnosis and treatment are swift and that the rehabilitation process is appropriate to the child.</p>

The first few days of assessment of movement, positioning, swallowing, speech and communication have to take place as quickly as possible. What this requires for children is paediatric care as well as the medical care that adults would receive. It is also important that parents are involved in all these processes. The Royal College of Physicians' guidelines are clear on all these issues. We must improve abilities in movement and speech for children affected by stroke and we have to find ways of helping them to adapt. Their skills in daily activities have to be developed, and of course they must be given social, emotional and practical support following discharge from hospital and during their re-entry into normal life in school.</p>

It is very serious, as 10 Hayne Street may be the site of the missing anthrax burial ground that has been lost for 488 years, since Christ Church, Spitalfields and the church at Charterhouse Square refused to accept the bodies of the 282 victims of the anthrax outbreak that wiped out the whole population of Hayne Street at that time.

However, if the question was whether I accept that there is an issue that needs further study in respect of 10 Hayne Street, the answer is yes. Crossrail understands that there is a very small possibility of buried human remains being encountered during the works at 10 Hayne Street. The advice that it has taken from experts at the Museum of Archaeology and Porton Down is that it is highly unlikely that the works would release any anthrax spores or bacteria causing plague. However, further sampling work will be carried out by experts in July. The results of any tests will be made available to the noble Lord and I will be happy to discuss them with him when they are available.</p>

For example, in my home town of Bradford, TB Alert presented to 170 local GPs in a continuing education seminar, with important messages alerting them to the symptoms of TB. In London, we have a partnership with the Homeless Link concerning finding and treating, which we have discussed in your Lordships' House before. We are developing training in those areas with homeless communities where we know there is enormous vulnerability to TB.</p>

It has, for example, identified 400 cases of TB, and works in prisons, homeless units and places across London. It is a very important part of the Find &amp; Treat TB exercise in London. I regret to say that at this moment the PCTs in London have yet to co-operate to find the relatively small amount of money-somewhere in the region of £20,000 to £30,000 per year each-to keep the mobile units going. The noble Baroness and I need to join together in campaigning to ensure that the units can continue this very important work.</p>

Quite often in migrant communities in this country it may be two or three years after someone has settled here before they develop TB. The key point is to ensure that those communities and community leaders are aware of the need to ensure that the doctors and communities themselves recognise and treat it as quickly as possible. The awareness-raising campaign is very focused on providing leaflets in different languages and-as I mentioned in relation to Bradford-briefings for doctors. That is the way in which to contain TB and to ensure that we deal with it in the proper fashion.</p>

There is no doubt-as will be widely appreciated in the House-that there is at the moment considerable public doubt about GM. This is shown in that supermarkets are not prepared to stock many of the products, and of course supermarkets are reflecting the fact that they do not think they will make many sales. At present, GM products are all restricted either to the one that I have just identified, or for feedstuffs for animals. The rest of the world-outside Europe-has moved on and 25 countries are involved in GM food production.</p>

Furthermore, if cars are to be needed for short journeys, considering the increase in the production of electric cars which has been announced, will he ensure that all new train station car parks can charge those cars?</p>

Today, we have announced that the Leaf will be produced in the north-east. That is a decisive step forward in making the United Kingdom a manufacturing base for plug-in hybrid and electric cars. We have also recently provided £30 million of funding for a plugged-in places initiative that will identify three significant regional centres for electric charging infrastructure: London, the north-east and Milton Keynes. I launched that scheme in London a few weeks ago in a supermarket car park, so we are taking very seriously the points that the noble Lord raises. It is important that, over time, we establish an electric charging infrastructure across the country that encourages people, including those who do not have off-street parking, to buy electric and hybrid cars.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="10031838000095"></a>I turn to palm oil, which is the particular source of biofuels at issue in the research work reported in the newspapers recently. It is important to understand that palm oil is a small proportion of biofuel production. It accounts for 10 per cent of the 1,284 million litres of biofuel used in the UK in 2008-09, and less than 4 per cent of global demand for palm oil comes from biofuels. It is not the case that all palm oil production is unsustainable, even in the terms of the research that was conducted. Research carried out by the Renewable Fuels Agency suggests that certain practices can be undertaken to limit the unwanted impacts of biofuels. Specifically to palm oil, this report highlighted that there are potentially 35 million hectares of unused land in Asia where suitable biofuel production, including palm oil production, could take place. The issue at stake is not simply the source of the biofuels but the land in question when it comes to production. Clearly, deforestation or the transfer of land from agricultural purposes to certain types of biofuel production may be undesirable, but there is plenty of marginal or unproductive land across the world which would be suitable for these forms of biofuel production.</p>

Therefore, can he not nod too closely towards the false gods of intermittent renewable technology in preparing his plans for this exciting development in our transport system?</p>

However, my noble friend is absolutely right as to the benefits of high-speed rail, one of which is the much lower carbon impacts that it has per passenger mile than alternative forms of new transport capacity. The average carbon emitted per passenger kilometre by high-speed rail is in the range of 8 to 17.6 grams of CO2, based on the current operation of Eurostar. That compares with an average of 128 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometre in the case of car travel and 171 grams per passenger kilometre in domestic aviation. There are significant carbon advantages to be had from high-speed rail if we are going to provide significant additional transport capacity between our major cities.</p>

Much more traffic will be able to use other lines as a result of the high-speed line. Will he also please take account of the fact that the fares charged to passengers are another important factor in the volume of use that these lines will get?</p>

All the modelling work done by High Speed Two Ltd, which prepared the plan on high-speed rail that we published last week, was based on the assumption that fares charged on the high-speed line would be the same as those charged on the existing network; it was not based on any assumption of a fares premium. On modal shift from other forms of transport, all the international evidence is that, when journey times between major cities by train can be reduced to three and a half hours or less, a significant shift takes place from the plane to the train. In the Command Paper published last week is the projection that with lines extending from London to Manchester and Leeds-connecting respectively with the west and east coast main lines so that high-speed trains can then run through to Glasgow and Edinburgh-it would be possible to have a Glasgow and Edinburgh to London journey time of three and a half hours. That would be a massive achievement for the railways and would lead to a significant shift of traffic from the plane to the train.</p>

However, from the end of May, those EU rules will be changed; foreign lorries will be able to undertake only three jobs in seven days, and they will have to come over to the UK loaded.

The first, entitled <I>Quality and Equality: Human Rights, Public Services and Religious Organisations</I>, provides us with a marker to calibrate the deterioration over the past three years in establishing greater equality in the world of employment.

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="10031838000121"></a>It is undeniable that in its present form, with 26 seats reserved for the Church of England Bishops, the House of Lords presents an odd face to the outside world. It is interesting to note that even within the 38 provinces  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_675"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Anglican Communion, only England still insists on an established church. This is a problem. As the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, warned some eight years ago in your Lordships' House, when this subject was last debated,</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000425"></a>"it is as bad for a Church to be seen as enmeshed in the state as for the state to be seen giving privileged eminence to a Church".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/5/02; col. 770.]</ul>
<a name="100318-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="10031838000122"></a>Regrettably, in the intervening years the Church of England has continued unwarrantedly to enjoy and increase its privileges within the state-in education, in employment practices, law and public broadcasting-as statutory public services continue to be contracted out to religious organisations.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="10031838000123"></a>The consequences have been to imperil the take-up of public services and to encourage discrimination against users of such services and against employees who owe allegiance to another religion or to none at all. Most egregious has been the discrimination offered to the gay community. Career prospects have stalled for some attached to the wrong religion or to no religion at all. Religious harassment has had an open goal to shoot at, while the status of religious organisations has been undeservedly advanced under the cover of the public purse.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="10031838000124"></a>Uneconomic duplication in the provision of services is a constant danger, as is the division fostered within local communities by the separatist approach of the religious organisations using public money. In the current Equality Bill, for instance, the Government still ponder giving religious organisations the power to discriminate against gays, non-believers and believers of other faiths who apply for lay positions. The hesitancy over the sensible amendment from my noble friend Lord Alli, which would allow religious groups to conduct civil partnerships in their own places of worship if they so wish, is a further example of bowing to church pressure.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="10031838000125"></a>In the Children, Schools and Families Bill, religious groups have seemingly wrested back the control to teach children their versions of sex education. The Government's feeble sticking plaster of a "balanced approach" will hardly dilute the ingrained homophobia and antipathy to sex redolent in the teaching practices of too many of our religious schools. Seventh-Day Adventists, for example, can still freely teach that abortion is a sin to be tolerated only in exceptional circumstances, like a pregnancy arising from rape. It is the lack of clarity and consistency in the teaching of sex education that continues to maintain our unwelcome reputation as being at the bottom of the class in Europe for unwanted teenage pregnancies.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="10031838000126"></a>It now appears that believing in a religion privileges those who have broken the law. A custodial sentence was recently set aside because the prisoner was deemed to have a greater sense of right and wrong, born of his religious belief. The fact that three out of four prison inmates declare themselves to be religious undermines that partialist philosophy.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10031838000127"></a>Astonishingly, the BBC found itself taken to task by a member of the most recent Church of England Synod for failing to support religious broadcasting. This inventive thought was suborned by the evidence  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_676"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 676</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the rampant but wholly unjustified doubling of religious output by the BBC. The new fad for identifying the religious allegiances of the contributors to "Any Questions"-three Roman Catholics and one Church of England on last Friday's edition-as well as the scheduling of two "thoughts for the day" each morning also scotch that myth. Indeed, the shame of the continued ban on humanists contributing to "Thought for the Day" is only intensified by that privilege being afforded to the Pope, an offer masterminded by the unabashed Catholic Mark Thompson, D-G of the BBC.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10031838000128"></a>I turn to the second BHA report, outlining support for a secular state in an open society. Some years ago Prince Charles suggested that when he came to inherit, he would like to be known as the defender of faiths. While overlooking humanists, he at least was recognising the very changed nature of contemporary Britain. We now live in a multicultural and multireligious Britain, where other religions challenge the established Church of England.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="10031838000129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morgan, reminded us in our 2002 debate that the Church of England is a mere fraction within a fraction, even within the declining Christian communion. It still has a position in our nation and society, however, that is wholly incommensurate with its numbers, and nowhere more so than in your Lordships' House, where 26 privileged places are preserved. Other religions are gradually being represented here, including by our colleagues from the Muslim community and, more lately, the noble Lord, Lord Sacks, representing part of the Jewish community. The House of Lords is becoming secularised accidentally.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10031838000130"></a>I believe that in the future reform of the Lords, all privileged places should go. If religious groups are to be present, they should be chosen in line with their current strengths, and humanists and atheists should also be acknowledged, given the growing numbers of our tradition-Professor Richard Dawkins and David Attenborough spring to mind-indeed their wider interests would make a valuable contribution to this House.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10031838000131"></a>I believe that the time has come for a secular state within an open society-an idea which has the support of many humanists and many among the Anglican Communion. Many Anglicans share the view that their history and tradition cannot alone justify their traditional privileges. These people yearn to proselytise Anglicanism with modern and contemporary arguments, competing against other religions and none.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10031838000132"></a>The BHA case for secularism argues that we can no longer base society on a shared religion, but rather on shared values. A secular state, which is most avowedly not an atheist state, seeks to protect the rights of all citizens to hold their own beliefs, religious or otherwise. A secular state is assuredly an open and an even-handed state in which people's participation in public institutions does not depend on their religious or non-religious convictions.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10031838000133"></a>Can a society function without shared values? I suggest that one possible answer is to distinguish between the public and the private space. In the public space lie the shared values of tolerance-a willingness to accept differences and to allow others to pursue their own ideas and ideals-the political values of  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_677"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 677</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>equal citizenship, freedom of speech and assembly, the right to vote and stand for public office, social justice, equal opportunity and the right to a fair share of the common resources of society. All these make up a wide consensus. Still, some may demure from this apple pie and motherhood, but I believe that even those opposed to the summary of liberal values might nevertheless welcome some formulation of the secular state, where they can reserve the right to proselytise in the public square that which they celebrate in the private circle. This formulation provides autonomy, letting people make their own choices about the most important things in their own lives. Secondly, it provides fairness to those who might otherwise-</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10031838000136"></a>It provides fairness to those who might otherwise have to bend their strongly-held views to those who hold very separate and equally strongly-held views. Finally, there is a pragmatic consideration that in such a society governed by tolerance, that where inimical views spill into the public from the private domain, they may still be accommodated by some reasonable give and take exercised on all sides. I give as an example the debate over religious symbols. Sometimes I think we get in a muddle by denying someone the right to wear a preferred religious symbol; if it does not interfere with health and safety or offend other people, we could exercise a little more tolerance.</p>

<a name="100318-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10031838000137"></a>Sometimes it would be helpful in this debate on the secular state if some of those who oppose humanists and atheists did so with a less shrill voice than is occasionally heard, where typically we are termed "aggressive secularists", for instance. It would be helpful if they learnt a little more about humanism, atheism and, indeed, secularism, because they are not all the same. It would also be helpful if they understood that the basis for our thinking is that we simply do not believe in something which does not exist. There are many reasons why we should try to find what one Member of this House talked about when describing himself as a wishy-washy liberal-the common elements that we share, religious or otherwise. I give as a practical example the preservation of our wonderful churches, which represent some of the best architecture in the land. That is typified in the case of Liverpool-the subject of our next debate-which is home to two of the finest and most interesting churches.</p>

I was intrigued, if not impressed, by the point that the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, was seeking to make about the schizophrenia between the private and public sectors of life. As a follower of Jesus Christ, I believe that it is an integral part of who I am that I should try to practise in the public sector what I believe and practise in the private sector. I know that my noble friend shares similar sentiments and I would be grateful for his view on that point.</p>

Indeed, one of the two or three points that I shall make in my speech addresses exactly that perspective. My noble friend and I share those views and I agree with him.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10031838000142"></a>The two documents that we are debating this morning represent, to me, a pretty wacky, hardcore, highly illiberal, campaigning sort of humanism. They point the way towards a society dominated by majoritarianism and not a more tolerant view of society, which I always thought that the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, in whose highly thought-provoking debates I have taken part before, really shares. I trust that he does not want to replace what he might see as any reactionary illiberalism with a new overwhelming, overbearing, liberal intolerance, any more than would, I suspect, the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, whose remarks on this subject I have listened to with respect in past debates.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10031838000143"></a>When we talk about these issues in your Lordships' House, it has become the fashion to declare faith, or lack of faith. I can date it exactly to 2 March, when during the proceedings on the Equality Bill, in moving an amendment of high importance on adoption society matters, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, crisply declared for Anglicanism. There and then, the floodgates opened and people were popping up and coming out all over the Chamber about their faith, or lack of it. For example, in a marvellous short speech declaring against the imposition of majoritarian views, the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, said that he was "not a religious person".</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="10031838000144"></a>There was one wonderful moment for the real connoisseur, the best declaration of all-again of Anglicanism-from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bradford. Some of us had suspected for some time, as he rose from the Bishops' Bench, gorgeously attired in full episcopal choir dress, all billowing sleeves secured with black cuffs to match his black tippet, that he might indeed be an Anglican. We had taken the hint. So the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, whose speech I look forward to greatly, can accept that we have taken the hint in respect of him. For the avoidance of doubt, I had better come out and declare Roman Catholicism, while at the same time recognising, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, does, that people of faith have no monopoly of spiritual values, probity, morality or goodness. Indeed, I have a friend who is a model possessor of all of these virtues  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_679"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 679</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>while being what I can only term a high church atheist in his manifest disbelief, and I admire him greatly for his strength of character.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="10031838000145"></a>Now I move to the point that my noble friend Lord Mawhinney raised in his welcome intervention. As the state moves from being a universal service provider to becoming more and more a service commissioner, it would be wrong to try to exclude religious bodies from being commissioned to provide services, as the British Humanist Association seeks to do, for the following three reasons. First, it would be rank, outright discrimination, plain and simple. Secondly, it is philosophically bankrupt and inept, for it assumes automatically that, while faith-based projects are not value-neutral, by definition secular projects are inherently value-neutral. That is nonsense. All bodies are rooted in a particular place or places and have a set of values. Indeed, the whole purpose of seeking to tap into the energy of civil society, as my noble friend wishes to do, as opposed to the impersonal state, arises from its rootedness in different narratives, traditions and identities, all of which are value-laden. At this time when all political parties, I thought, were seeking to promote diversity and choice, it would make absolutely no sense to prevent faith-based welfare providers from accessing government money, because some people like using services given in a faith ethos or by faiths.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="10031838000146"></a>Some recent words from the Catholic Bishops' Conference are worth a quick ponder. Its document <I>Choosing the Common Good</I>, which was published earlier this month, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="10031838000410"></a>"The right to religious freedom means the right to live by faith, within the reasonableness of the common good, and to act by faith in the public forum".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000388"></a>It goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="10031838000411"></a>"Partnerships between Government and faith communities should be mutually respectful and permit these communities to act with integrity in the provision of public services for the common good. This has long been the case in the provision of education and the benefits brought by that partnership are substantial and clear".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000389"></a>The one thing that I would like to hear from the Minister is a clear reaffirmation of the value, in the mind of the present Administration, of religious education provided by Muslims, Jews and Roman Catholics. I trust that the Government will not waver in giving a clear message of support for religious education from these and other groups, such as Hindus, Sikhs and whoever else chooses to set up a school. So I say a "Hear, hear!" to the sentiment that we just heard from the Roman Catholic bishops, which I am sure is shared by people of all faiths and people of no faith.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="10031838000147"></a>I will end by saying that I totally disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, much as I welcome his debate and respect him personally, that in the past five years religious groups have somehow advanced in their influence. To me it is the exact and total opposite: you cannot wear a crucifix to work, offering to pray for someone gets you suspended and Catholic adoption societies are getting closed down. Rampant secularism is what we face, of the most intolerant and illiberal sort.</p>

Yesterday, the Minister John Denham announced that the Government have set up a new £1 million fund to help faith groups get their voices heard by government and public bodies. This is occurring just at the moment when other public services and local councils are facing real and deep cuts. Council tax will rise by the lowest amount possible since it was introduced and certainly well below the inflation level. It is extraordinary that the Government have £1 million to dispense in this way. In addition to that fund, the Government have set up a £50,000 social action prize fund to help publicise and reward faith-based projects, and only faith-based projects, that are finding new ways of meeting local problems, bringing people together and meeting the needs of local communities. This debate is therefore extremely timely.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="10031838000149"></a>This is a particularly interesting issue and I think that, essentially, there are two possible approaches to it. The first is that voluntary services, by which I mean the extra services, can be delivered by people who see that extra service to the community as part of their faith. That is an entirely valid approach which is much to be welcomed. The second is that public services should be delivered by public servants who are bound by a common public service code of values. That is what I understand as a public service.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10031838000150"></a>I went to a Quaker school and, during my formative years, I learnt just what the first of those approaches-extra voluntary services delivered by people of great conviction-can mean. For me, Elizabeth Fry was perhaps the most powerful example of such an approach. In 1818 she became the first woman to give evidence to a House of Commons committee, on the conditions then prevailing in British prisons, and with her brother she persuaded Peel to introduce a series of prison reforms that ended with the Gaols Act 1823. As your Lordships will be aware, she was active not only in prison reform; they both also took up the causes of abolishing capital punishment and establishing hostels for people with nowhere to go. I am glad to see that there are still so many living memorials to her, particularly in Islington, where the Elizabeth Fry Institute and the Elizabeth Fry probation hostel are still located. I would therefore not decry this sort of effort made by people of faith, whatever faith it might be.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10031838000151"></a>Perhaps my deep concerns about a model which relies on delivery by people of faith stem from my time as a district councillor. I remember a time when well-intentioned councillors who wanted the best for their communities had the power to approve or disapprove housing allocations. Of course they tried hard to be objective and to allocate on the basis of housing need. Inevitably, however, they bore in mind what they believed was the best for their communities. That could include not housing those whom they regarded as undesirables or who they thought would not fit into the community. The ramifications were that the same people were constantly turned down despite their evident housing need, and their children suffered a life of constant

I am pleased to say that we as a council got rid of that councillor discretion long before the Government decided to do so nationally. Those councillors were acting in good faith and on what they believed, but they were not acting on objective criteria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="10031838000152"></a>My worries could be slightly lessened by the evangelical Faithworks movement, which has been heavily involved in contracting. It has produced a charter which calls for Christian groups to be non-discriminatory, principled and non-proselytising in how they operate. That might be adequate, except for the Government's increasing propensity to make exemptions in law for faith groups on fundamental points of principle. The noble Lord, Lord Harrison, has outlined those very adequately today and we debated them very recently in your Lordships' House. This debate is particularly timely because we have learnt that the Government are willing to make exception after exception on important points of principle. We need to be deeply concerned about that.</p>

I am very sorry to see that the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, has abandoned the debate after making his point as I think that he would have gained much from the other speeches, as I intend to do.

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="10031838000157"></a>The notion of aggressive secularism-I think that the noble Lord, Lord Patten, called it rampant secularism-perpetrated by some religious leaders is, of course, a nonsense. Secularism seeks neutrality from the state as regards different religions and beliefs, including non-belief and non-religious affiliation. Humanism maintains-as I do-that values, ethics and morality are not exclusively in the gift of religion. Individuals can, and do, develop moral codes that are equally valid and have a right to live by non-faith principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="10031838000158"></a>In the death of Dr Ashok Kumar MP, we have just lost a great humanist of Hindu and Sikh extraction. He said in response to a debate on faith schools in 2006, "I am against segregation". He said that we do not want groups of people in society who believe that one religion is superior to another. He regretted that the then Secretary of State, Alan Johnson, was "slapped down" by the whole religious lobby. In my view the influence of religion on law-making is very disproportionate.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="10031838000159"></a>The European Humanist Federation has stated that the EU consistently favours the churches and religious organisations. Humanists are systematically excluded from negotiations. Christian churches are granted huge privileges-for example, financial-in European countries. Secularism or humanism does not, of course, seek to exclude those with religious beliefs from public life, but those beliefs should not be imposed on others. Public policy and laws should not be based on religious premises or arguments and religious people and institutions should not have a privileged position in society. All relevant human rights instruments, including the European Convention on Human Rights, give equal standing to non-religious beliefs as to religious ones. This principle is unchallenged in legal circles but seems not to be recognised by many politicians and has not been implemented.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="10031838000160"></a>Education is an example of a public service that has been caught up in the religious controversy surrounding the growth of faith schools. The majority of these schools are run by the Church of England and other Christian denominations, often for good historical reasons. There are also increasing numbers of Muslim and Jewish faith schools. All this seems to be in the name of promoting fairness and equality. I believe that it has got out of hand, and what is more, the majority of the general public seem to agree. In an ICM poll for the <I>Guardian</I>, 64 per cent of people believed that schools should be for everyone, regardless of their religion, and that the Government should not be funding faith schools of any kind. Other polls suggest that people regard faith schools as divisive, are opposed to their expansion, and are against the state funding them.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="10031838000161"></a>It has been shown time and time again that faith schools actually decrease parental choice. The increase in faith schools replacing comprehensive schools has led to a situation where parents in some areas do not have the choice of whether to send their child to a faith school. I know that there are arguments that faith schools have a positive ethos, achieve better academic results, have better discipline and so on, but I would say to that: not necessarily. I shall quote from the <I>Times </I><I>Online</I>:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10031838000413"></a>"In some areas, schools employ exclusive and discriminatory policies".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000391"></a>What worries me is the notion that faith schools encourage community cohesion. I cannot see this to be the case when children are divided up and removed from their communities. Equally, a school whose intake is of one religion only, as some are, cannot promote cohesion and respect for other communities in society because they are exclusive. Indeed, the report <I>The Case for Secularism</I> goes so far as to say that:</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_683"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 683</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10031838000414"></a>"In a plural society, people of all faiths and none have to learn to live together without their differences degenerating into destructive conflict ... they [faith schools] encourage children to identify with their own separate communities and are thus liable to perpetrate a climate of suspicion and distrust".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000392"></a>Of course there are excellent faith schools which are inclusive, but there are also excellent community schools. An excellent school depends on good leadership, good teaching, good resources and respect for the views of others, not necessarily on a faith base.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="10031838000162"></a>To return to my first points, ethics, a positive ethos and moral standpoints do not stem exclusively from religious faith. Public services or the state should be separate from religion while living alongside religions of all kinds. Politics, citizenship, equal rights and social justice are part of a civilised society. As my noble friend said, sometimes there is a distinction between the public and the private, so they should enable people of different viewpoints to live together in harmony. <I>The Case for Secularism</I> maintains that the state should be,</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000426"></a>"neutral between those differing values and should not impose a concept of the good life".</ul>
<p><a name="10031838000393"></a>If only all states could do this, we might be spared some of the conflicts evident in our world today. In this country, I fear that we may create tensions unnecessarily by promoting religions as a solution to societal problems in the name of some sort of equality.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="10031838000163"></a>I hope that politicians of all parties will take note of this debate and of the reports introduced by my noble friend. I hope that we will henceforward proceed with great caution in considering the future of our society in relation to religion and its place in human rights and public services.</p>

<ul><a name="10031838000427"></a>"an increasingly diverse society can live at ease with itself in a spirit of equality and justice".</ul>
<p><a name="10031838000394"></a>I agree entirely with that ambition. <I>The Case for Secularism</I>, however, uses the words "secular", "neutral" and "open" almost as synonyms-a neutral state in an open society. I want to argue that no state can be neutral and that it can and should be open. Neutrality is impossible. Here, for example, we frequently debate policies with a bias towards the poor and ways to defend the vulnerable. Those debates are value-laden, and rightly so. We do not want a neutral state.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10031838000165"></a>Rather, we need a state that is in favour of values and where there is an encouragement for groups with different values to express them for the common good. Christians and others, including non-religious humanists, should be encouraged to take action in order to benefit others. The report, <I>Quality and Equality</I>, for example, acknowledges the part played by Christians in the work of hospices, which are among the great contributions of our generation to the common good. Hospices are supported by the state and many of them are an expression of Christian values about the importance of the quality of life to its end. That value is not solely  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_684"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 684</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Christian, and others will share it, but many of those hospices would not exist without the support and encouragement of the state for a faith-based enterprise. Quality provision in society comes from the shared values of particular communities and not simply individuals.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10031838000166"></a>For example, Caring for Life is a charity based in Leeds that provides accommodation and employment for people with learning difficulties. Those who run it believe that fulfilment of life is found in Jesus Christ, and they share that with others. <I>Quality and Equality</I> would argue that its clients are vulnerable people who should not be exposed to Christian propaganda. But it is exactly because of their vulnerability that care needs to be shown, and Caring for Life can do that only in terms of Christian modelling. <I>Quality and Equality</I> seems to argue that it is acceptable to have Christian principles so long as you do not share them. That fails to understand the nature of faith, where the whole of life is lived in conscious obedience to God. Work for the common good springs not only from that, but is also integrally a part of it.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="10031838000167"></a>It is a will o' the wisp to chase a neutral society. It is far better for the open state to support quality wherever it is found. I believe that that goes for education. Christians and others make significant personal and communal contributions to our state school system. Last week, I cut a ribbon at the opening of a new maths block at Abbey Grange Church of England High School in Leeds. Maths is taught according to the national curriculum. That block benefited from substantial financial contributions from Christian bodies. Churches give millions each year to the education of our children. They work for the common good.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="10031838000168"></a>If it were true that education in this country was reserved for Christians or Muslims and denied to others, that would indeed be wrong. But there is not a single example in <I>Quality and Equality</I> of education or social care being unavailable to the general public. Rather, the work of faith groups means that there is greater availability of services at less cost to the taxpayer. Often it is religious groups who provide services for the homeless, for those seeking a way out of prostitution, for those who are dying, and for vulnerable groups who need special care. It is right for those services and the values they represent to be supported by our state. <I>Quality and Equality</I> claims that 70 per cent believe that church and state should be kept separate, while 9 per cent disagree. But if you had asked people whether Leeds City Council should support the work of St George's Crypt in its care for the homeless, I believe that you would have got a very different answer.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="10031838000169"></a>Moral values belong to communities as well as to individuals. I want now to reiterate and develop a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten, earlier in the debate. We demonstrated that on Tuesday, when we spoke of the values of this House as a whole in compiling the code of conduct, not simply of the individual values of Members.</p>

<a name="100318-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10031838000170"></a>The case for secularism is much too individualistic and fails to acknowledge the benefit of particular values expressed by groups and communities within our society.

This is indeed a timely debate, with a new Equality Bill now before Parliament. During consideration of that Bill, secularist Members of your Lordships' House have expressed concerns about the employment practices of religious groups contracted to provide social services to the public. As we have heard, the BHA report, <I>The Case for Secularism</I>, addresses these and other concerns. However, I will leave the detailed analysis and arguments to fellow humanists who are well represented in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10031838000172"></a>I simply want to make some valedictory remarks, because I am standing down at the end of this Parliament, after serving five years as chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group. Noble Lords may be reassured to hear that that group is not motivated by hostility to religion. Indeed, I am pleased to see in her place the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, an active supporter, who often describes herself as a Hindu humanist-and India of course fights to sustain its proud secularist traditions. Our members include Jewish and Christian humanists, including one MP-a practising Anglican-who turns up at our AGMs to ensure that we are not short of the required quorum. This good Christian believes that humanists have an important role to play in Parliament through an all-party group, with the advantages that that brings when booking meetings and communicating with other parliamentarians.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10031838000173"></a>However, as one would expect, most of our members are agnostic or atheist. Interestingly, our numbers have more than doubled in recent years, and membership now totals more than 100 MPs and Peers from all major parties and the Cross Benches in your Lordships' House. This growth in numbers and the more active contribution of humanists in Parliament owe a great deal to the work of the British Humanist Association, including the reports that we are debating, and I want to outline some of that activity and support.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10031838000174"></a>First, let me make clear that the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group is not formally affiliated to the BHA, nor is it signed up to all its priorities. As I hope noble Lords will have gathered, ours is a loose grouping that is able to accommodate all the idiosyncrasies that flourish here in Westminster. That said, on behalf of my humanist colleagues, I thank the BHA for the quality of its briefings produced in the first half of this Parliament by Andrew Copson, and latterly by Naomi Phillips. I also congratulate Mr Copson on his recent appointment as chief executive of the British Humanist Association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10031838000175"></a>The BHA's thorough research helped many of us to make informed and better-argued contributions to debates, particularly on complex ethical issues which arise in this House by the year.

Some noble Lords with whom we have differed may feel that we humanists have had too much to say in controversies about education, but we make no apology for trying to improve the teaching on sex in schools, nor for our opposition to the teaching of creationism as science.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="10031838000176"></a>Most importantly, with briefing from the BHA, we were able to monitor and question some of the policies and practices of faith schools. In this contentious area, noble Lords should be aware that religious groups also support a secular approach to schooling. The BHA is a partner in the Accord Coalition, which advocates inclusive schools and is, in fact, chaired by a rabbi, Dr Jonathan Romain. Indeed, the BHA's wider work makes it increasingly active across communities by consulting and co-operating with national and local government, broadcasters and public agencies.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="10031838000177"></a>Like our All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, the BHA also takes an ecumenical approach to politics. I spoke on the Labour Humanists Group platform at our Brighton party conference. I am told that the Liberal Democrat humanists staged a successful event at their party conference. There is now a Green Party humanist group, and I am particularly pleased to hear that there is a flourishing Conservative humanist group. All of this helps to explain why membership of the British Humanist Association has grown significantly in recent years and it now has a total of around 20,000 members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="10031838000178"></a>Recruitment was probably boosted last year by the widespread celebration of the bicentenary of Charles Darwin, which also merited a debate here in your Lordships' House. An Early Day Motion calling for Darwin Day to become a public holiday was put down in the House of Commons. I recall it with some sadness, because the EDM was sponsored by our colleague in the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, Ashok Kumar. As the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, told us, Ashok died earlier this week. He was a much-loved Member and will be much missed. All of us mourn his tragic death and our condolences go out to his brother Ravi and the Kumar family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="10031838000179"></a>Ashok Kumar was also a scientist, and no doubt appreciated the observation made in the 18th century by the father of economics, Adam Smith, that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="10031838000415"></a>"Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000395"></a>It seems very fitting that Adam Smith's portrait should now ornament our banknotes, complementing that of Her Majesty, Defender of the Faith. That is a very British juxtaposition that Adam Smith's friend and enlightenment philosopher, David Hume, an atheist icon, would surely have enjoyed.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="10031838000180"></a>I therefore conclude in the spirit of British enlightenment to which humanists and Christians contributed so much, with the hope that we can again find a common cause to advance a shared tradition of rational debate and tolerance in the defence of human rights and the pursuit of social justice. Naturally, in today's Britain, we humanists would hope to work more closely with enlightened followers of all religions. I hope therefore that our All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, under a new chair in the next Parliament, can find ways of bringing together

That was the definition in the admirable report of the British Humanist Association, and it was very much accepted by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds. Somewhat illogically for this purpose, the absence of religious beliefs counts as a belief. This neutrality requires the separation of Church and state, which was one of the most important consequences of the Enlightenment, which I regard, in the words of Isaiah Berlin, as one of the best and most hopeful episodes in the history of mankind.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="10031838000182"></a>Indeed, it can be strongly argued that one factor which has held back the development of Islamic states is the absence of this separation. Likewise, perhaps the most encouraging recent development in the Muslim world has been the move towards democracy in Indonesia, the largest Muslim state, which would not have been possible if it were not for the fact that Indonesia does not have a theocratic constitution.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="10031838000183"></a>In Britain, however, the separation of Church and state, which as Voltaire and Diderot very much acknowledged and which contributed hugely to the Enlightenment, is not complete. The presence of the Bishops in this House is one example; the establishment of the Church of England is another. I suspect that deep down, right reverend Prelates themselves realise that whatever the historical justifications, today their constitutional role in the legislature is indefensible. While Members of this House are appointed, some Bishops may well justify their individual appointment. One has only to cite the contribution made by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth. But with the decline of religious belief in this country, especially in the number of active members of the Church of England and the increase in the followers of other religions, the Bishops' constitutional position is a glaring anomaly.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10031838000184"></a>The other and more important failure in separating church and state is state support for faith schools. The main argument advanced against these schools is that they are divisive. That is certainly supported by the evidence of Northern Ireland. However, my main argument is more fundamental. For schools to teach children faith or belief is a basic contradiction of what education should aim to achieve. Parents, understandably, want their children to follow their faith. If they wish to bring up their children in their own beliefs, no one can deny them the right: but the role of schools is to teach children to think, to question and not to accept unquestioningly what their teachers, or the press, or the Government, or their church, may ask them to believe.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10031838000185"></a>Children must be given the opportunity to choose their own beliefs. Schools should not indoctrinate. In fact, schools should do much more not only to teach science, but to teach understanding of the scientific

Schools should teach children to reason. Teaching them about the miraculous power of prayer to heal the sick, for example, is contrary to all reason and evidence and hardly promotes a rational approach.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="10031838000186"></a>Many religious schools-certainly many Church of England schools-do not indoctrinate. I went to a Church of England school and had to attend chapel daily. Most of us regarded chapel as a rather boring chore, but the singing was thoroughly enjoyable. Generally, the school strongly encouraged free thinking. Almost the only teacher who tried to inculcate religion was the school chaplain, a keen cyclist irreverently known as Cycling Jesus. Of course, Sir Humphrey might explain that Church of England schools are different because, as he once observed, the Church of England is primarily a social rather than a religious organisation-or was before the evangelicals got going.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10031838000187"></a>Believers often tell us that teaching religion is to be nurtured because it provides a moral basis to education, and that without God there is no basis for morality. This often-proclaimed belief not only shows a degree of arrogance, but has no logical justification. It is arrogant because it suggests that believers are somehow morally superior, for which there is no evidence whatever. It is also illogical. To put it briefly, when the likes of Christopher Hitchens point out that the Old Testament God is nasty, bloodthirsty and vengeful, Christians reasonably answer that their God is the god of the Sermon on the Mount, which is one of the most admirable moral texts. Similarly, when critics of Islam quote bloodthirsty passages from the Koran, moderate Muslims point out that other passages show Allah to be tolerant and merciful. What both say is that to qualify as a proper god-their God, the real God-He must be good. He must qualify by a standard of goodness that is independent of the deity, because if He is not good, He cannot be the real God.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10031838000188"></a>Schools should certainly teach children about religions, because they are an important part of our-and other nations'-cultural heritage. However, far greater emphasis should be placed on science teaching, not only because we need science for prosperity, but because science plays a much more important role in promoting the values of a civilised society than is generally acknowledged. Science has made the world more civilised. It is also one of the pillars of a liberal democracy. Because science rejects claims to truth based on authority and depends on the criticism of established ideas, it is the enemy of autocracy. Because scientific knowledge is tentative and provisional, it is the enemy of dogma and promotes tolerance. Because it is the most effective way of learning about the physical world, it erodes the superstition, ignorance and prejudice that have been at the root of the denial of human rights throughout history, whether through racism, chauvinism or the suppression of the rights of women. Teaching science is the opposite of teaching belief. It is the surest way of promoting the values of the Enlightenment and of a secular society.</p>

I am a supporter of the British Humanist Association. I believe that secularism is the best system in a multicultural society in which we want everyone to feel that there is equality and justice for all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10031838000190"></a>We have recently been discussing the Government's Equality Bill, which seeks to legislate for some of these aims. It should not be thought that secularism is anti-religious. I am not myself a believer in any of the main religions, but I know many to whom faith is important. They have a right under the Bill, and as part of our belief in human rights, to practise their faith without discrimination and, indeed, to proselytise if they wish to. However, religious and philosophical differences should not become divisive, which can happen when religious fundamentalism seeks to impose its beliefs and way of life on people who do not share those beliefs. I emphasise that I am talking about fundamentalism, as some mainstream religions have become more tolerant and have come to terms with a less traditional and more modern outlook.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10031838000191"></a>I do not much like faith schools. I believe that they are divisive and have that effect on communities. However, they exist and they receive state funding, but they should not be permitted to discriminate against those who may not share their faith and should certainly not discriminate as far as concerns employees. They should not be able to insist that employees, except those specifically involved with instruction relative to the faith, should be bound by the precepts of a faith that they may not share. Employees have rights that must be honoured and which are provided by our legislation.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10031838000192"></a>According to the press, the Pope, who is due to visit the country later this year, has been critical of our newly emerging equality legislation. Of course, he has the right to express his opinion. However, the many who feel as I do also have a right to insist to our Government that his views on our legislation should be entirely disregarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10031838000193"></a>The British Humanist Association has produced a report on human rights in public services and religious organisations. The issue has arisen because of the apparent desire of the Government to contract out the provision of some public services to religious organisations. The BHA report concluded that there was little evidence to support the view that religious organisations offer any particular benefits to the supply and provision of public services. In the view of the BHA, there are no good reasons why public services should not be provided on a secular basis. Otherwise, there could be problems for users and employees, with a risk of discrimination and of infringements of human rights.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10031838000194"></a>There has been some discussion of these issues during the passage of the Equality Bill. I am still not content that the issue has been resolved. We still need legislative provision to ensure that a religious organisation providing a public service cannot discriminate between service users on religious grounds or, indeed, on any other grounds, that it must respect the human rights of users and that it must have equality-based employment policies. It is very necessary that parallel public services

That would be unacceptably divisive in a multicultural society.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10031838000195"></a>It must be made clear that the Equality Bill rightly establishes protected categories, which include sexual orientation. Discrimination against individuals on that basis, either as service users or as employees, cannot be allowed under our own or EU legislation. There has been a long and largely successful campaign in the past few years against discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people. We cannot have those gains that that campaign has elicited endangered by discrimination. That is why the Equality Bill is so important.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10031838000196"></a>The BHA report makes it clear that secularism does not pose a threat to anyone-quite the contrary. It enables religions and beliefs to exist and flourish. It seeks only to protect against discrimination those categories of people who generally are in a minority and whose vulnerability is deemed to require legislative support. That is what secularism is all about and we should all support it.</p>

I am not and never have been a humanist and I have no intention of becoming one. I was very much welcomed by the humanist group, particularly as at that time I sat on the Tory Benches. The group was very short of Tories and I even got elected vice-chairman. When I pointed out that I was not a humanist, noble Lords said, "It's all right, we are a broad church".

I take a world view rather than just a British view of religion. All the faiths and religions that we are talking about are world religions. They have an impact on many countries, not just on this one. If we are talking about equality and human rights, have we given any thought to the situation of poor women in developing countries and how religion has impacted on their lives? By and large the Anglican Church is not so discriminatory. A lot of good work is done by not only that church, but other churches, too, in developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10031838000199"></a>However, let us consider the Catholic Church-the Holy See. What is it doing to women? It preaches women's human rights every day, but we are now drowning in people. There were 2.6 billion people in 1950, but there are now 6.8 billion. We expect that by 2050 there will be another 1.5 billion. Yet the Pope goes to Africa and says, "Don't use condoms". Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor said, "Don't send condoms to Africa; send them antiretrovirals". What does that mean? Make them ill first and then give them the medicines. We know very well that only about 6 per cent of people in Africa get antiretroviral drugs. It is not even possible for everybody to get the drugs. Surely it would be better to prevent people from getting sick first. I cannot understand why the Holy See and the

They still seem to be living in the Middle Ages. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Patten, is not here, as he refers to the Holy See as head office. People like him should be telling the Holy See that it is time to change its policies on abortion and contraception. What happens to the poor women? One woman dies every minute of every day in childbirth. When did we last hear of a woman dying in childbirth in this country?</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="10031838000200"></a>Religion should be a force for good, but it is not always so. As a Hindu atheist, I take my moral teaching from wherever I find it. The noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, says that he follows in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. I remind myself all the time: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. If we remember some basic teachings of any faith, we will not go wrong. When I used to work in the community and race relations, some of the worst hypocrites and racists were those who attended church every Sunday. They were very much against the newcomers. The churches rejected West Indians when they came to this country, so they formed their own. Let us not get carried away by the "goodness" of religion. It is not all good.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10031838000201"></a>We have faith schools. Church of England schools were the only ones that taught poor children. Had they not existed, poor children would not have had any education. They are part of this country's history. But why do we need to separate our children now? Do we not remember what happened in Northern Ireland? We do not have to go very far; we need only look at what is still happening there, across a small sea. Why should children be taught separately? They should be taught together so that they have at least one chance of getting to know one another and maybe developing a liking and respect for one another. I do not believe in faith schools.</p>

In fact, they are now taking children who are not Jewish, which is a very good thing. Church of England schools always take children who are not of that faith, but the Catholic schools do not-some do, but many do not. This country should not have schools that take children from only one faith. It is not in the interests of how we want to develop.</p>

I had hoped to take one line in this debate, but since it has gone almost entirely one way, I thought that I should tilt the balance and try to raise issues that are in danger of being ignored.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10031838000206"></a>In recent years we have witnessed a clash between two kinds of dogmatism. For secularists, religion is at best a nuisance and at worst a source of positive mischief; religious people should therefore be kept out of public life or kept at as much a distance as possible. Religious people resent this and become aggressive, which further feeds secularists' anxiety. They become even more anti-religious and a vicious cycle is born. What is the way out of that? That is my main concern. </p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10031838000207"></a>A way out is to develop a kind of secularism that is sensitive to religious aspirations, that understands what religion is about and what it means for religious people, and to develop a view of religion that recognises the importance of secularism. That is a large philosophical and cultural debate. In my own field of moral and political philosophy, that is where the energies of a large number of people are currently concentrated-rethinking the traditional understanding of religion. Thanks to the Enlightenment, a particular view of what religion is about has become dominant. If one looks at a pre-Enlightenment way of understanding Christianity, one will see that that is not how it was understood. Even to equate religion with faith is something very peculiar to modernity. When one talks about religion, immediately questions arise. If you think of religions like Hinduism, for example, they have very little to do with beliefs and are primarily concerned with practice. If you think that religion has to do with God-well, Buddhism has nothing to do with God. It is agnostic, and Jainism is positively atheistic. When we talk about religion, it is important to bear this in mind and not to homogenise different systems of thought.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10031838000208"></a>With that proviso, it is worth recognising that when one talks about religion, one ought to appreciate that it is grounded in recognition of a sense of mystery and a sense of finitude of human life. There are experiences that we cannot easily make sense of and we also recognise that as human beings we have certain profound limitations. In one form or another, religion is an attempt to come to terms with these two. It is in that sense a corrective to human hubris, and also a corrective to the illusion of human omnipotence and human omniscience.</p>

<a name="100318-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10031838000209"></a>If one therefore understands religion not in terms of God or of dogma but as a certain sensibility that recognises the finitude of human beings and which also recognises that there are large areas of human experience that we do not fully understand, then any well considered form of humanism should recognise it as an important and valuable dimension of human life. After all, humanism is concerned with human beings, and human beings-as I argued earlier-do appreciate that certain elements of human life include recognition of religion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10031838000210"></a>I am entirely in favour of a secular state-but what is a secular state? In the debates in India, where for the past 60 years we have been spending an enormous amount of energy in trying to understand what secularism is, secularism is basically about the relation between  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_693"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 693</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>state and religion. This relationship can take any number of forms. If, for example, you had to install a wall of separation as the Americans have done, then the state will not be able to interfere with religion. And if it did not, it would not be able to abolish the practice of undecidability, or sati or many other things which derive their sanction from religion. So the wall of separation is out. A secular state is basically a state that pursues secular goals, is guided by secular public reason, and does not make its membership, namely citizenship, and the concomitant rights dependent on subscription to a particular religion. That is basically what a secular state is about.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10031838000211"></a>The question is: why should the state be secular? There is nothing inherently good or bad about the state being secular. It should be secular because that is the only way in which certain important values can be realised. What are these values? There are three. The first is liberty of conscience, by which I mean respect for deeply held beliefs provided that they are rationally defensible. The second is equality of treatment-that regardless of whether one belongs to this religion or to that one, or to no religion at all, all should be treated equally. The third is that the state should be constituted so that all its citizens feel that they belong to the same community and no section feels alienated. These three-liberty of conscience, equality of treatment, and what one might call fraternity or a sense of community-are the three fundamental political values, and the secular state is the only state that is capable of realising them. On that we must insist and we cannot compromise. That does not mean that the state cannot and should not co-operate with religious institutions or that, if it were to do so, it would somehow lose its caste or get corrupted.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10031838000212"></a>In modern society we face acute problems, and in solving those problems the state has its own limitations. Its administrative reach is limited, its moral reach is limited, it relies on certain motivations, and it is necessarily impersonal and bureaucratic. Therefore when there are problems where it cannot reach, we might need to rely on organisations that might be able to fill the gap. I can think of areas-spaces-where religious organisations might be able to deal with drug addicts or the rehabilitation of prisoners, or to foster better understanding between different communities and, in so doing, promote community cohesion. In other words, religion-with all its limitations, which I fully recognise; and I am not a religious person-can be a force for public good, and there are areas of life and groups of people for whom it can be an important source of motivation. In so far as it is a source of moral energy, it would be foolish for secularism or humanism to ignore it all together.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10031838000213"></a>What therefore needs to be done is for the state to lay down certain basic principles or parameters within which public discourse and political action can take place. We can have religious schools. I am not particularly in favour of them but I know that they can promote certain important values and mean a lot to parents. But there are religious schools-I know of two Muslim schools for example-where art is not taught and music is not taught, because they go against Islamic principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10031838000214"></a>The question therefore is for the state to lay down certain parameters, and as long as these parameters or standards are met, religious schools may be allowed to function. I would say the same about adoption agencies and lots of other things. Secular principles are absolutely crucial, but there is no reason why a good humanist may not engage in a critical dialogue with religious persons. After all, every view of the world has its limitations. Secularism has its own limitations and religion may be able to contribute something useful.</p>

In 1959 I was there as a tourist. I had reached Smolensk, which has a fine cathedral, so I asked the local Intourist office to get me a guide. I was provided with a real Soviet battleaxe who had probably killed an entire German regiment with her bare teeth. As we were coming out of the cathedral, she said to me fiercely, "Do you believe in God?". I hummed and hawed and eventually replied, "I suppose I don't, really". "Well then", said the battleaxe, "Why don't you stay in the Soviet Union?" . She clearly thought that non-believers were persecuted in Britain. Of course, we are not. We have had equal rights ever since Charles Bradlaugh was allowed to take his seat in the House of Commons. But that is not the end of the story. A friend of mine once described himself as a non-practising atheist. That is what I was for a long time. I had been brought up as an Anglican-though my father was a non-practising Jew whose favourite meal was pork pie.

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10031838000396"></a>Things have changed. When I was a law student in the USA 50 years ago, my friends and I laughed at the infamous Scopes trial, when, in the 1920s, a young schoolteacher in Tennessee was prosecuted for teaching his pupils about evolution. We thought that that was something entirely in the past. It never occurred to us that in the 21st century there would be millions of Americans who still believe in creationism. Nor did it occur to me at the time of the Cuban missile crisis that in 2010 we would find ourselves more worried by the acts of Islamic fanatics than by the threat of a nuclear world war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10031838000397"></a>Religion can of course cause harm as well as good. Religious hatred still exists, as has been shown in Northern Ireland, though I think it is fair to say that that is more about nationalism than about religion. Religious groups can be blamed for teaching such manifestly absurd concepts as creationism. The Roman Catholic church, and some evangelical Christian groups, also can be blamed, and I think should be blamed, for their rejection of contraception, which has enhanced the spread of AIDS, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, has pointed out, has caused great hardship and suffering to women particularly in developing countries. Religion was also responsible for the death of nearly 3,000 innocent people in New York on 9/11, and for that of the 52 people who were killed here in this city some two years later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10031838000216"></a>It is not the role of humanists to go out and try to convert religious people to humanism; that is to turn humanism itself into a kind of religion. In a time of globalisation, however, surely we must all learn to live side by side. Education is by far the most important way of achieving that, which is why I entirely agree with every word that my noble friend Lord Taverne and the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, said about schools. I believe that the Government's support of new state-funded faith schools was a profound mistake. Surely children who sit side by side in a school will understand more about each other than will those who have been to separate schools.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10031838000217"></a>Religion must be taught in schools, it is an essential part of history-not only political and national history but the history of art, architecture and music, because so much early art is wholly religious. However, publicly funded schools should not teach that one church or religion knows the truth and that the others do not, or indeed that any religion is necessarily the truth. Religious faith is a matter to be taken up outside the formal structure of our schools, in Sunday schools and their equivalents in other faiths. It can be taught at home or, indeed, in schools on a voluntary basis, but it should not be part of the structure. This is a very valuable debate. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, on his Motion, and I am very happy to support him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10031838000219"></a>There were long periods, many, until his death in 2003, under the leading guidance of the late Lord Jack Dormand, who some of us remember, when even he was unable to get official recognition of the group as a proper all-party group. That was mainly because there were never enough members to fill the Conservative quota, despite the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, reminding us today that she was then a Conservative. She was punching above her weight, as she continues to do now as a Cross-Bencher. In those wilderness years, the group was still able to meet but did not have the privileges of an all-party group, for example, in advertising its meetings. For some time now, that has fortunately no longer been the case, and all-party support is assured with many distinguished speakers coming to talk to the group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10031838000220"></a>I am grateful to have my attention drawn by this debate to the two documents before us, which I might otherwise not have read. My remarks will be mainly prompted by the booklet<I> The Case for </I><I>Secularism</I>, which is highly readable even though it was written by a committee. It appears to have been written by the humanist philosophers' group which, I am afraid, might give me the licence to go off in a slightly more philosophical direction than is usual or ideal. This booklet argues very well the case for a particular form of secularism, and I am pleased that its preface says that not all humanists will be expected to support its  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_696"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 696</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contents. It is offering an invitation to debate those issues. In my opinion, it is really highlighting one level of secularism and inviting those with other beliefs to gather round and agreed to label the discussions and debates that follow as secular; that is, using a secular framework by the consent of all.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10031838000221"></a>I would claim that there is another, much deeper level of agreement and disagreement, which might distinguish the various participants in such debates and which, because of its deep and ingrained nature, sets up much greater and more fundamental differences between separate groups. These differences are often simply not addressed, as they are sometimes irreconcilable and difficult to articulate. For the reason that something can be reconciled, the simpler level of disagreement provides examples of what can usefully be discussed and might then lead to a harmonious and agreed outcome.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="10031838000222"></a>We might read about the discussion on when a religious cross might be allowed to be worn, or what type of burka should be worn, where secular reason is meant to hold the ring to provide an agreed outcome. Concepts such as private or public space are used, and one is aiming for a rational, secular framework and hoping that it causes a peaceful and harmonious outcome. While that particular version of secularism is obviously useful, -and, as some might say, a start-for me it leaves much deeper divisions unanswered and, often, unaddressed.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="10031838000223"></a>To give a rather facile example, one of the minor skills of civilisation-one which is, in fact, quite complex and which we acquire without too much conscious thought-is to be able to walk down a crowded street without generally bumping into people. That is a useful and almost unconscious skill that makes life more harmonious and bearable, but what is going on inside the bodies and minds of other people that we avoid bumping into is another matter and at a different level. This booklet, then, shows commendably how an agreed secularism might make life more harmonious at a simpler level but, in my opinion, it does not address the more fundamental differences that humanism should also be able to highlight. That is where faith and religious belief come in. I do not think that humanism or secularism should try to compete at the same level as religious belief, especially when such beliefs rely on irrational or non-rational practices or traditions.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10031838000224"></a>As a major aim, we secularists must encourage and emphasise a rational and reasoned response to what is presented to us, even though that might not be the easiest or most obvious way. In the long run, I believe that we have to rely on reason and-although I hesitate to say it in this age-science to arm our arguments. I hesitate about science because of the uses that it has recently allowed itself to be put to or pressured into. Having, as I warned earlier, talked in rather general philosophical terms, I realise that we are all living in the real world and that that is what the Minister is having to answer on, and rightly so. I do not criticise those who are trying to solve everyday problems in the real world. Finally, humanism and secularism have a serious and increasing role to play, but there is some way to go before we can claim the fuller coherence of our philosophy, to which we should aspire.</p>

I am a member of the British Humanist Association, which I came to very late in life. When I was a Royal Marine-I was called up-one of the first questions the sergeant asked me was, "What's your religion?" I asked, "What are the options?" He said, "Well, you can be a Roman Catholic, or Church of England or a Jew". I said, "When I was a boy, I went to a local church hall and I was a member of the Boys' Brigade". He asked, "What religion was that?" "Congregationalist", I said. "Right", he said, "You're an OD", and so I asked "What's an OD?" "Other denominations", he said. In other words, I was the great unwashed; I did not have a firm place.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10031838000226"></a>Religion as such has never played a major part in my life, but I have always acknowledged that what are called Christian beliefs-or that style of living, with the good Samaritan and all the other things that go with that-are the kind of precepts that I would like to feel that I try to live by, but without being moved. I tell some of my friends, who I know are deeply religious in the terms which your Lordships would understand, "I admire you, and I'm jealous of the fact that you have got that faith". Invariably, they say to me: "We may be religious, but we are religious because of what we do". In other words, they put into practice their religion but they are not necessarily over-religious. Over the past few years, we have come to recognise in society-it may be that the influx from overseas has sharpened and heightened this-that there is shrillness about divisions in attitudes. I am very uneasy about that.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10031838000227"></a>In Edmonton, which I was proud to represent for a period, there is a little church, what I would call a happy-clappy church. It is mainly West Indian. Every year, they invite me along, and when I go, a lady who is a waitress in the House next door tells me to wait at the door. Then she marches in and says: "All stand. Here comes the Lord!" I march in and wave, and for five minutes there is pandemonium. Then, when they have settled down, we sing hymns.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10031838000228"></a>That brings to my mind that when my mam used to have two hours off out of 168 in a week, she would go to the Women's Guild. When she came back, I would say: "What did you do, mam?" "Oh", she would say, "we had a raffle; we had a cup of tea; we had a speaker; and we sang hymns". That was her social intercourse; that was the way she could relax. I would hope that secularism should be heavily overlaid with tolerance and understanding. I have no great faith that either this House or anything that succeeds it in any shape or form will radically alter the attitude of the British people. If we are involved in anything, it should be the attitude of the British people.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10031838000229"></a>I looked at the options open to me. My wife was a member of the humanists. I tolerated that, agreed with it, or I supported her. I did nothing untoward. When she died, she opted for what is called a green burial. There are burial sites all over the country, which are not graves in the sense that we know. She was buried on the edge of a bluebell wood 10 years ago, and the bluebells have grown over the ground in which she is

I have difficulty finding the slab of concrete, which was laid flat, not standing up. I go there and I do as any loving husband having lost his lovely wife would do. It provides me with the opportunity of thinking of the life that we led and the place where she is now. I do not know where she is. There are those who know for certain that when they die, they will go to heaven. I wish them well, and I hope very much that their ambition is fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10031838000230"></a>The shared values which this document tells us we should learn from are a valuable contribution to the system in existence. I once had the opportunity of going as a friend of Israel to the Middle East and the Holy Land. What almost paralysed me was looking at the scenes in the Holy Land. They were exactly what had been painted in the children's Bible which I had been given years ago. I was deeply moved in the knowledge that I was in a place that had given so much comfort, guidance and assurance to so many people. The last thing I would ever do is to knock either religion or people who follow it. I believe that there is a place for such attitudes. However, the percentage of the British people who have become apathetic towards religion is not diminishing. The number of churches of all denominations, but especially of the Church of England, is declining. They are being transformed, knocked down or sold. That must be a great worry. All I want to say to our good friends in the Church of England is that they have a fight on their hands to try to stem the tide of apathy.</p>

I have agreed with my noble friend over many years about pretty well everything, but I have to say on this occasion that I am one of the members of the Church of England to whom he referred. I should also thank my noble friend Lord Harrison. He does us a service by enabling us to have such a debate, which I have not had in any other forum that I can remember. Long may he continue to do so.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10031838000232"></a>I would have left this to be a conversation among members of the British Humanist Association had I not read the document, which I am grateful to my noble friend for drawing to my attention. What wound me up to think that I should say something were two sentences in the conclusion. It is a good idea to have a text; I am used to having that every Sunday and reflecting on it thereafter. This is what worried me. The conclusion states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="10031838000416"></a>"It is hard to see how religious organisations could be involved in providing public services in ways that would benefit society as a whole ... we maintain that all organisations involved in the provision of statutory public services should be secular ones".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000398"></a>I do not agree with that and I am happy to say that my view is shared by a very prominent person describing himself as a secular humanist. He is a good and right honourable friend of mine-the Secretary of State, John Denham. He made a speech yesterday. It is very timely that we should be having this debate today, although that is probably by accident. I do not know Southampton, but I agree with him wholeheartedly. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="10031838000417"></a>"In my own area, Southampton, we are fortunate to have diverse and vibrant faith organisations active in the community in a whole variety of ways. Helping provide essential services to the  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_699"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 699</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>elderly; supporting parents having a difficult time, campaigning on behalf of the vulnerable and marginalised. Their involvement and enthusiasm contributes immeasurably to the health and strength of our community".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000399"></a>I think that you could say that about pretty well any community in Britain.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10031838000233"></a>The weakness of the document, although there is much in it that I agree with, is that it overlooks the involvement of faith communities, as we call them these days-obviously, I speak with such authority as I do about the Church of England-in not only providing vital public services today but developing what were originally new public services. Think about education. Think about hospitals. Think about hospices. They became universal public services later. That is unarguable; it is what happened. To take a random list-I could have made it very long had I wanted to-of groups involved today from all sorts of different religious bases, there is the Methodist Homes for the Aged, which co-operates with the state, locally or nationally, to provide services, the Salvation Army, which works with unemployed youngsters and the victims of domestic violence, the Jewish Housing Association, Hindu services for the elderly in one or more of our big cities, work with offenders leaving prison by Christian groups, welfare-to-work projects, debt advice work, work with hospices and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, mentioned, wonderful work in overseas development. The whole fair trade movement was substantially due to churches and the involvement of Christians in its early evolution.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10031838000234"></a>There is a lesson to be learnt from that. Why are faith groups so good at doing such things? It would be churlish not to acknowledge that they are very good at them. The answer is that they reach parts that lots of other groups cannot reach and they do so in a practical, demonstrable way. Friends of mine who are clergy in the Church of England, particularly in deprived areas, often say that all sorts of people are involved in helping-teachers, doctors and social workers-but all too often it is the vicar or the priest, who does not go home somewhere else at the end of the working day and who lives in the heart of the deprived, if that is the right word, community, who picks up issues as and when they arise.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10031838000235"></a>The role that the church plays at times of national tragedy cannot be overlooked. When dreadful things happen in our country-the Hillsborough tragedy, for example-where do people go? Often, it is the cathedrals and churches of our country that are filled on such occasions. I guess that my noble friend Lord Harrison is also a strong supporter of the state support that goes to cathedrals and churches. It goes to them not because they are beautiful buildings, though they may be, but because they are living places where people get joy, solace, comfort and inspiration. It is a good job that they do this and continue to do so, for the reasons that I have described: these are the places to which people go at times of difficulty and stress.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10031838000236"></a>Time is short, so I will simply make one final point. We often hear about the imminent divide; we assume that this is a secular society and that the church is on the way out. Christmas services in 2008 were attended by 2.6 million people-in my book, that is not something  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_700"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 700</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is on the way out. Given that people had to turn out from a nice warm room to walk through the cold winter's afternoon or night and sit in a very often cold church for an hour to hear some music and listen to sermons of variable quality, that is not a bad turnout. I am not surprised that 72 per cent of the British public described themselves as Christian in the last census. That was self-definition, not some chap with a clipboard going around for an opinion; that is how people wished to see themselves described.</p>

<a name="100318-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10031838000237"></a>I conclude as I started, with the words of a secular humanist, my right honourable friend John Denham. In his speech yesterday, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="10031838000418"></a>"To conclude, I know that there are still those who ask why Government should be interested in faith groups and vice versa. Why don't we just leave each other in peace? I think the answer is clear. Politicians are interested in shaping society for the better. Faith is one of the powerful forces which shape society. Most people of faith are concerned for the human experience today, as well as spiritual welfare in the future. It's natural and inevitable that we should be interested in each other's views and want to work together".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000400"></a>We can all say amen to that.</p>

My wife and I stayed in Lincoln overnight driving between London and Saltaire the other month. As we got up in the morning, a captain who had been killed clearing mines in Afghanistan was being buried in the cathedral. The entire city stopped and the cathedral was full. This is still very much part of our national life; at the moment we have no alternative and it helps to pull us all together. As the right reverend Prelate said in his excellent speech, we need to remember that values are a matter for the community as well as for each individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10031838000239"></a>I speak as a liberal. Liberalism as a tradition grew out of the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries and, on the continent, the reimposition of authoritarian rule by states closely linked to the Roman Catholic Church. Continental liberalism, as I learnt about it, was therefore strongly anti-religious and linked to the Freemasons; the revolution was as much against the Catholic Church as it was against authoritarian government. I was being briefed on liberal Judaism the other day and I was told that Napoleon opened the ghetto and thus provided the basis for liberal versions of Judaism to emerge. The Catholic Church in the 19th century set its face against modernity on the continent. The Pope not only declared himself infallible but issued papal bulls denouncing liberalism as a heresy. The Roman Catholic Church is still doing its best as a hierarchy to come to terms with a liberal and open society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10031838000240"></a>In Britain, the legacy of the Civil War left us with a rather different tradition: a broad and open established church and a large dissenting tradition that enforced a degree of toleration if we were to live together as a society. Out of that, a rather different English, British liberal tradition has grown, in which the overlap between  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_701"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 701</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>church and state has not always been entirely clear. After the Irish rebellion of 1798, for example, the then Whig Government argued the case for the provision of public funds to train Roman Catholic priests in Ireland-against strong Tory opposition for years afterwards, of course. That was so successful in training Roman Catholic priests to understand the balance that one needed between church and state that, when they were inspected in the 1860s, the Vatican delegation accused them all of Gallicanism. I strongly support provision of state funding for the training of imams in Britain on exactly the same basis today. We need to help our new religious communities to understand how their established practices of religion need to come to terms with a shared understanding of the relationship between faith and the state.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10031838000241"></a>At least this humanist report recognises that there are divisions in all faiths between a more liberal and a more fundamentalist or conservative approach. Liberalism as an approach, whether secular or faith-based, is something that we all need to defend. I am a liberal because as a choirboy I sat through umpteen sermons by on the whole very progressive members of the Church of England, which is how I acquired my strong political values: tolerance, respect for diversity and so on. But let us recognise that it is easier to be a liberal if you are well-to-do, secure in your identity, securely employed and within an established and secure community. Thus in the 1960s it was easy to be a liberal and easy to be a liberal Anglican. Now, in a much less secure world, fundamentalisms of all sorts-both faith-based and secular-are much stronger, just as in the 1930s the political, secular fundamentalisms of communism and fascism had a much stronger appeal. We find evangelicals within the Protestant churches and those dreadful fundamentalists in the United States, a fundamentalist tendency within the Roman Catholic Church and bitter fundamentalists within the Jewish, Hindu and Muslim communities. We need an alliance of liberals, humanists and religious liberals against fundamentalists of sorts-including, if I may say so after having been unhappy with some of the phrasing of one of these reports, against the most aggressive atheists and the most absolutist members of the National Secular Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10031838000242"></a>I take the separation of church and state as a given. I was astonished by the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney. I thought that I remembered a text that said, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's". That, for me, is one of the basic texts on the separation between church and state. Of course there is tension between public and private belief and between public and private life. I was unhappy with the way in which the report treated that tension, because it is a necessary and creative tension. Liberalism is always a set of arguments about the values on which we operate: the definition of our open society and the relationship between members of that society-the position of women, for example, on which liberalism, when it started, was pretty poor, as with everything else. We must continue to argue; that is the basis of an open and a liberal society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10031838000243"></a>The question for all of us is: how do we promote public debate on underlying values and on the moral dimensions of social life, of economic life and, for that  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_702"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 702</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>matter, of life itself? If we want to be more than a consumer society, we have to tackle what the noble Lord, Lord Graham, described as "the tide of apathy" and to debate the underlying moral issues: the moral basis of capitalism and of social life of all sorts. My father spent 40 years working for a bank that had been established by Quakers and I am very sorry that it has entirely lost any sense of moral purpose, as has much of the rest of our financial sector. Indeed, we all need to redefine the moral basis of capitalism now.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10031838000244"></a>There is a messy overlap between the state and society and now between the public sector and the voluntary or third sector. As public funds are cut, we will have to rely more on voluntary funds, which will make life much more difficult. I strongly agree with the report in its attack on the neo-conservative tendencies of Tony Blair in taking the American example and wanting to reintroduce a faith dimension rather aggressively into the provision of public services. We on these Benches oppose the expansion of faith schools; we want to see schools that are rooted in local communities. We recognise that a line needs to be drawn between public provision and private choice, but we also recognise that those with religious motivations do much in areas such as social care through hospices and services to old people and to street people; the Salvation Army does much for the homeless on our streets that is not otherwise provided for. Adoption is the most delicate and the most difficult area. There is also a great deal to be done in prisons and in the provision of probation. We find young men in prison without any system of values. They are completely lost and they somehow need to be helped as they come out of prison to reintegrate into society and to find a sense of purpose.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10031838000245"></a>It is not entirely irrelevant to our debates that many of those who are most committed to making voluntary contributions to the community have a religious motivation. The question of motivation also comes up in the humanist report. We see much too little in our current society of the motivation to do more than look after ourselves and we should not denigrate the fact that those with faith are much more likely to think that they must also work for others.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10031838000246"></a>In an open society, we live with creative tension about the boundaries separating the public and the private and the overlap between the secular and the religious. We live with a monarchy-a remarkably absurd thing in many ways, but we have it-and with an heir to the throne who says that he wishes to be a defender of all faiths. I attended the 50th anniversary service of the Queen's coronation in Westminster Abbey, and there, under the lantern, were representatives of Britain's other faith communities: Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Zoroastrian and Baha'i. I thought that that was a splendid and wonderful thing to have. It was inclusive and it recognised that Britain is a society of many diverse communities. We want all of them to contribute to the common good. That is what we should be working towards.</p>

I did not recognise any militant humanism or secularism in the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, presented his case. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, referred to Dr Ashok Kumar, with whom I traded seats in the other place for a number of years. I, too, found him to be a man of astounding character and of great and gentle humour. He was intelligent but always incredibly courteous, and he will be a real loss to politics and to his constituency.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10031838000248"></a>It will come as no surprise to the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, when I mention that we on these Benches have been fairly consistent in our position on these matters and have not been able to muster sufficient Members to help the All-Party Humanist Group to get off the ground, for which I apologise. At the same time, I wish to present our case, which is this; we believe not that there is too much activity from faith groups in the public sphere but that there is too little. We believe that faith groups make a huge contribution to society at all levels, and their voices are to be celebrated and heard and their activities are to be encouraged and not discriminated against.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10031838000249"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grocott, listed many of the areas in which the impact of faith groups is felt by people in this society, such as in education, in which they have an outstanding track record. People go to faith-based schools not necessarily just because of their religious faith but because they deliver an outstanding education. They queue around the block to go to them. This contrasts very sharply with some of the education provision in some of our city areas in particular. They have been hugely successful in this area, as they have been in the care for prisoners when they leave prison, in the care for asylum seekers and in the care for the disabled. Mention has been made of international aid and development.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10031838000250"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said, faith groups are also interwoven into the fabric of our society. Church is where people get married, children are baptised, and people are buried; it is a focal point for the community. Our churches and faith communities are often the first and the last in our societies to provide compassion and social care, and they are to be encouraged on that basis. Moreover, some of what has reached the history books has been extremely welcome. We argue that, in recognising the driving force of faith, we also recognise the foundations of what we enjoy in our modern liberal democracy-it is not a theocracy; no one wants to live in a theocracy-whether it is John Locke's concepts of freedom, democracy and social concern; the work of William Wilberforce to abolish slavery; the incredible work of Elizabeth Fry and the movement behind Sunday schools, which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned; or the work of old Shaftesbury, of William Booth and of Josephine Butler. The list goes on. Internationally, there is the work of Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King. There is in all this an incredible, strong third dimension to their huge intellect and will: the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects that drive those people forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10031838000251"></a>I totally endorse the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Graham, whose contributions, I am sure, are always enjoyed by those on all sides of the House. He said something very telling about faith communities; it is not what you believe, it is what you do. That is key to how faith communities engage in the public sphere. It is not so much what they believe, it is what they do. It is the effectiveness, or the lack of effectiveness, of what they do that should be the sole arbiter, in our view, of whether they are allowed to contribute to public service.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10031838000252"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, referred to the fact that faith communities often contribute in a way which could be described as a public good. I think that that is true and that we should recognise that contribution. I was reminded of an interview that I watched one Sunday morning a few months ago with someone who, I suppose, would be classed as the archbishop of the humanist agenda, Professor Richard Dawkins. He was being interviewed by Adam Boulton, a very talented interviewer who often manages to get to a grain of truth, and they were talking about Darwinism. Adam Boulton asked whether Darwinism could be described simply as survival of the fittest. To that, Richard Dawkins replied, "Well, yes, it's a bit crude, but it could be described as survival of the fittest". Adam Boulton said, "Presumably, then, you must recognise that human society must be the most un-Darwinian society, because we care for the poor, we protect the weak and we ensure justice-this is profoundly un-Darwinian". To that Professor Dawkins replied-it took my slightly by surprise-"I agree, human society is profoundly counter-Darwinian and thank goodness for that". Quite who he was thanking at that point, I leave for theologians to muse over. He said, "I think it is a good thing that we live in a rather non-Darwinian society".</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10031838000253"></a>Who could deny such a statement, when people have seen the carnage wreaked in our world by atheist regimes, whether by the Stalinist regime in Russia, the Nazi regime in Germany, Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot-so many of these regimes. Much is done to question the contribution of religion, but we also need to recognise what happens when people place themselves in the place of God and how they then treat their fellow men and women. History would say that that is something which should certainly be considered.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10031838000254"></a>I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, that atheism, humanism and secularism need to be discussed in schools and in fact they are part of the national curriculum. In religious education, there is a part which refers to that. I think that that is quite right and that the national curriculum needs to be respected in faith schools-I understand that it is-and in non-faith schools. It is important that people learn tolerance and respect for all views.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10031838000255"></a>Moving briefly, since time is running out, to the reports presented to us here, my noble friend Lord Patten made a very powerful speech with which I found myself in complete agreement. He asked whether we could really believe that there is such a thing as neutrality in the public sphere regarding religious faith. That point was also made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds. I agree with this: it is  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_705"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 705</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not possible for people to have neutral or scientific politics without moral or religious commitments. I am arguing that it is not possible to decide questions of policy, law, justice and rights without presupposing some account of the good life. For religious people, that will be theologically driven. The role of government is to preference some notions of the good over others. In the words of the 2009 Reith lecturer, Michael Sandel:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="10031838000419"></a>"Asking democratic citizens to leave their moral and religious convictions behind when they enter the public realm may seem a way of ensuring toleration and mutual respect. In practice, however, the opposite can be true. Deciding important public questions while pretending to a neutrality that cannot be achieved is a recipe for backlash and resentment. A politics emptied of substantive moral engagement makes for an impoverished civic life. It is also an open invitation to narrow, intolerant moralisms. Fundamentalists rush in where liberals"-</p>

<p><a name="10031838000401"></a>with a small "l"-</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000428"></a>"fear to tread".</ul>
<a name="100318-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10031838000256"></a>That sums up our position. In the area of equality, we say that faith organisations, which are driven by a sense of faith, should be able to attract people to come and work for them who hold to that particular view. In the same way, I am sure that, should the British Humanist Association ever be seeking a new chief executive, it would want somebody who believes in what it believes in. It would seem appropriate, therefore, and perhaps just a little bit generous, that one ought to allow church organisations and religious organisations to do the same.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10031838000257"></a>In essence, we are not arguing that faith communities have a monopoly on compassion; of course they do not. However, they have done an outstanding job in our society, up and down this country-people will acknowledge that. This is not about discrimination against. It is about looking at the results which are delivered, not by politically correct inputs, but by socially advancing and community encouraging outputs.</p>

It has been, at times, an intense and intellectually engaged debate. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I do not succeed in fully reconciling the spread of views that have been expressed. I welcome also the contributions from the British Humanist Association and the Humanist Philosophers' Group, which are referred to in the Motion. These documents challenge the misconception that humanists and other non-religious people are anti-religious-a point made by my noble friend Lord Macdonald and endorsed by my noble friend Lady Turner-and although the Government might not agree with every single point, I recommend them as accessible and thoughtful contributions to public debate.</p>

In my noble friend Lord Parekh's terms, the key components of a secular state are liberty of conscience and equality of religion with all citizens belonging to the same community.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="10031838000260"></a>We recognise the importance of freedom of religion and belief-indeed, we have sought to guarantee it through equality legislation-and the value of having an open society with diverse religions and beliefs. To foster an open society, the Government have strengthened the legislative framework needed in a secular state to protect people from discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief or, indeed, lack of it. This includes The Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 and the Equality Act 2006. The present Equality Bill is intended to declutter the existing legislation, including that relating to religion or belief, and to strengthen the law.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10031838000261"></a>Among the measures contained in the Bill is a new equality duty on public bodies which will bring together the existing duties on race, disability and gender and extend them to religion or belief, sexual orientation, age and gender reassignment. As noble Lords will be aware, the Bill will have its Third Reading in this House next Tuesday.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10031838000262"></a>The Government believe that it is important to ensure that members of all faiths, and those of none, enjoy the same life opportunities and feel confident in working with people who have different beliefs, but shared values, to work together towards common goals. This is a pragmatic approach that respects people's freedom within the law to express their beliefs and convictions, and our belief in active communities. Indeed, it is a key aim of the Department for Communities and Local Government to help bring about a society in which different belief systems, whether religious or otherwise, are equally understood, respected and valued.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10031838000263"></a>As many noble Lords will know, in July 2008 we published <I>Face to Face and Side by Side</I>, a framework for partnership in our multifaith society. This was part of our overall response to <I>Our Shared Future</I>, the report of the Commission on Integration and Cohesion, and in particular, its recommendation that there needed to be more constructive relationships between those who are religious and those who are not. As the document itself says, we believe that the building blocks set out in <I>Face to Face and Side by Side</I> represent the key enabling factors for effective dialogue and social action involving people with different faiths and beliefs and those with none. We recognise that the commission's highlighting of the importance of going beyond interfaith dialogue to encourage meaningful dialogue between people of faith and no faith and people of different ethnic backgrounds and cultures, has been echoed by those who feel excluded from the table of interfaith dialogue. It is aware that the key rubbing point for many interfaith forums is the role of people who profess no religious belief in this dialogue.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10031838000264"></a>The British Humanist Association has itself been working to address that. The Government's Faith Communities Capacity Building Fund funded the British Humanist Association to establish and support a network  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_707"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 707</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of grass-roots humanists to work and build relationships with statutory bodies and participate in groups that advise local authorities on matters of religion or belief. The project aimed to enable local humanists to network with faith and interfaith groups, to participate in groups convened by local authorities and to contribute towards good relations and community cohesion.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10031838000265"></a>With individual faith communities there is often diversity, and there are challenges both for faith communities engaging in interfaith activity and for local authorities. It can be all too easy to take the simplistic route of conflating faith, ethnicity and culture, but faith is a distinctive category in its own right.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10031838000266"></a>Some faith communities have much to offer in helping to eradicate disadvantage, and the Government seek to enable them to use that capacity for the wider benefit of society. More on that shortly, but our work with faith communities is not about privileging religious groups or discriminating against those with non-religious beliefs or no belief. It continues to be a priority of the Government to ensure that those with a non-religious perspective are also able to participate in constructive debate on policy issues and to inform the development of legislation. We welcome the opportunity to gain further insight into the humanist perspective and regard the regular meetings that my officials have with the BHA as a valuable opportunity for constructive discussion.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10031838000267"></a>The Government want to see a Britain with strong communities where people with different beliefs get on together and are treated equally, but we do not believe that this kind of secular state is incompatible with one in which particular faith groups deliver certain services to their own group or to the wider community. We believe that what we might call "the faith sector" is a key part of the third sector.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10031838000268"></a>The principle at the heart of faith communities-and, I should say, of humanists too-is service to others. This can be about working for a better quality of life in the local community or about global issues of justice or the environment. It is on the basis of this principle that the public sector can build a working partnership with faith communities to deliver services as varied as homeless shelters, youth clubs, health and social care, health advice and relationship counselling services. We have heard of others from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, my noble friend Lord Grocott and the noble Lord, Lord Bates-I think his expression was that often they are the first in and the last out. The days are gone when the public sector could delivery virtually all these services in a top-down manner, and if services are to meet the needs of communities then communities themselves have to be engaged. It is right sometimes to speak about the coproduction of services to help us describe the processes that may need to happen. This is also about efficiency and getting the best value for money, not measured in crude monetary terms but in terms of the best outcome for communities.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10031838000269"></a>Then there are the buildings. With 54,000 places of worship in the UK, faith communities are essential providers of sacred and secular spaces for people to interact and pursue shared activity. These spaces are found in all parts of all our communities, from large  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_708"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 708</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cities to small rural villages. They are used by local people for local events and activities, and often function as the primary resources and buildings for community spaces and essential meeting places. They are supported by networks of experienced, willing volunteers.</p>

<a name="100318-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10031838000270"></a>I recognise some of the concerns that the British Humanist Association has so clearly articulated. It may be helpful for noble Lords if I deal in turn with a few myths surrounding the funding of faith-based bodies, a point touched upon by a noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Issues around the funding of faith-based bodies may underlie the reservations that are shared by many in local authorities, and thus can obstruct the fair access of such bodies to public funding and tendering opportunities as part of the third sector. My department issued a paper about these myths yesterday at a conference on faith and social action, a matter referred to by my noble friend Lord Grocott in his contribution.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100318-0008.htm"/>


<a name="100318-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10031838000271"></a>One myth touches on the equality points I made earlier. It is sometimes believed, I understand, that faith-based bodies would not help people of whom they did not approve, like atheists or homosexuals. However, the equalities legislation is quite clear on this. All providers of goods, facilities and services to the public or a section of the public are obliged by law to provide services to all those who need them, irrespective of religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender or race. The Equality Bill presently before this House extends that to cover age as well. Faith-based service deliverers are no different in a service-delivery context from any other provider, a point made by my noble friend Lady Turner. Indeed, discrimination against faith-based providers in a tendering process could itself be illegal. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, made that very point.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10031838000272"></a>It is sometimes argued that funding for a single group has negative implications for community cohesion. The fact is that although faith-based organisations can be funded to deliver services to a wide cross-section of the community, in particular circumstances they and other identity-focused, cause-focused or issue-focused bodies may be funded to work primarily with their own community.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10031838000273"></a>It is not illegal for a local authority to contract with an organisation to provide a service to a particular community-for instance, kosher meals on wheels for Jewish old people-as part of service provision for the local population as a whole. Sometimes that can enhance service access to especially vulnerable groups in society.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10031838000274"></a>Another myth is that funding will imply support for the religious views or doctrines of the organisation. Of course, such an implication would not be confined to faith-based organisations, and although the Government agree that local authorities and other bodies may want to include a disclaimer with any grant emphasising that funding does not imply support for an organisation's views or doctrines, this implication is in any case unlikely to be drawn. Funding to organisations to deliver services does not imply endorsement of their overall organisational aims, whether they are religious or not.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10031838000275"></a>Faith-based service delivery with public funding does not represent, as the British Humanist Association has suggested, an overly cosy relationship between faith and Government. It is about local government

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10031838000276"></a>The separation of Church and state was raised by a number of noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, and my noble friend Lord Harrison. Noble Lords will be aware that the Government will shortly be publishing draft clauses on House of Lords reform, as has been reported in the press. Those draft clauses will cover the issues around the composition of the Lords. I remind noble Lords that the 2008 White Paper made it clear that if there were to be an appointed element in the second Chamber, there would be a proportionate number of seats reserved for Church of England bishops. The White Paper also stated that the Government were clear that if a reformed second Chamber were wholly elected, there should be no seats for Church of England bishops or any other group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10031838000277"></a>A number of noble Lords raised issues around faith schools-the noble Lords, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, Lord Goodhart, Lord Patten and Lord Taverne, my noble friend Lady Massey and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds. The Government welcome the contribution that schools with a religious character make to the school system, both as a result of their historical role and now as key players in contributing to the more diverse school system with the greater opportunities for parental choice that we see. Ministers are keen to ensure that all maintained faith schools, along with all maintained schools, comply with the schools admission code and admissions legislation to ensure fair access for all children, regardless of their background. We remain committed to supporting the establishment of new schools by a range of providers, including faith organisations, where local consultation has shown that this is what parents and the local community want, where the school is willing and able to comply with the requirements on all maintained schools and where this greater diversity will help to raise standards.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10031838000278"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred to spending on capacity building at this point in the economic cycle. We do not resile from that. She made particular reference to her experience of dealing with local authority housing allocations and the need for objectivity. That of course is absolutely right and indeed what equality legislation should ensure. My noble friend Lady Massey talked about morals not being the exclusive preserve of religion. I absolutely agree with that. My noble friend Lord Graham was making the same point when he spoke of his view of life and expressed, in a sense, a jealousy of those who were able to base their moral position on religion. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds spoke of some of the important services delivered locally in his area. That underlines the importance of access that faith communities can provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10031838000279"></a>My noble friend Lord Macdonald gave us his view on the experience of the All-Party Humanist Group. I congratulate him on having achieved five years as its chair. It has been a particularly interesting time, especially with its growth of membership, as the noble Viscount,  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_710"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 710</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Craigavon, pointed out in his contribution. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, referred to the importance of teaching science in schools because it is, as he put it, the enemy of dogma. I do not disagree. I do not see that as being inconsistent with the teaching of religion and belief. The role of science in schools is clearly important. My noble friend Lady Turner said that religious and philosophical differences should not become divisive. I agree with her.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10031838000280"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Flather, moved us onto a world view with some very telling points about the impact that some religious approaches can have, particularly in poor countries and where churches are still opposing contraception, with all the devastating consequences of that in relation to explosions of population and increases in poverty. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, gave us some examples of the negative effects of religion, such as the bombings in London. I noted his opposition to publicly funded faith schools.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10031838000281"></a>My noble friend Lord Graham talked about the basis of his moral beliefs, which he said were based on those of Christianity. He spoke movingly of his wife and her green burial and his support for shared values. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, referred to the voluntary capacity that faith organisations can bring to the delivery of services in our country. That is, indeed, very important.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10031838000282"></a>Despite the important points of disagreement that may have emerged today, it is worth concluding on what I hope is a positive note. The British Humanist Association acknowledges the merit of a diverse society and in its publications recognises the contribution to British society of religious individuals, communities and organisations. I am sure too that religious people will recognise the contribution to this country of humanist individuals, communities and organisations. The concept of a secular state, in which religions and beliefs are treated fairly and in a way that does not disadvantage any group, is a helpful one that I am sure we can all support.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10031838000283"></a>There must be no question that this Government recognise the central role which Christianity plays within wider British society. The Christian churches have had an immense historic influence in shaping society and continue to make significant contributions in a wide range of areas such as community development, education, social inclusion and heritage. However, in Britain today people identify with a range of religions and beliefs. Within each there are different degrees of practice and belief and just as we must never ignore our Christian heritage we must also recognise and celebrate the contributions made to our heritage by individuals with humanist beliefs and by our compatriots of Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and other faiths. Whether we use the language of secularism or equality or human rights, I hope we agree that the state must be even handed to all lawful religions and beliefs and should not disadvantage any sections of society.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10031838000284"></a>It is important to ensure that people from all religious backgrounds-and those with no religion-enjoy the same life opportunities and feel confident in working with people who have different beliefs, but shared values, towards common goals. Today's debate has contributed to the ongoing conversation on how we

There may be continued debate over what shape such a secular state might take, but I hope the debate can continue and be as informed, thoughtful and as well reasoned as it has been today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="10031838000289"></a>I am greatly encouraged by those who have put their names down to speak in this debate. I believe the timing is providential. When I entered the ballot, I did not know that last Friday would see the publication of research, commissioned by Liverpool City Council. This research was undertaken jointly by the universities of Liverpool and John Moores and is entitled <I>Creating an Impact: Liverpool's experience as European Capital of Culture</I>. It lists the impacts under five headings: cultural access and participation; economy and tourism; cultural vibrancy and sustainability; image and perceptions; and governance and diversity process.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_712"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 712</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="10031838000290"></a>I commend this research to your Lordships, especially to those who are committed to the importance of sustaining the cultural dimension of our society. One of the anxieties we face in this phase of economic downturn is that cultural services could be seen by some as an easy hit and their budgets reduced or cut altogether. As I hope this debate will show, such cultural vandalism would prove a false economy. As Liverpool's experience as European Capital of Culture demonstrates, cultural activities have economic, social and health impacts that are way in excess of the investment into them.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="10031838000291"></a>It was the poet TS Eliot, in a book called <I>Notes towards the Definition of Culture</I>, who offered a succinct definition. Culture, he said,</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000429"></a>"may even be described simply as that which makes life worth living".</ul>
<p><a name="10031838000402"></a>He added,</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000430"></a>"it is what justifies other peoples and other generations in saying, when they contemplate the remains and the influence of an extinct civilisation, that it was worth while for that civilisation to have existed".</ul>
<a name="100318-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="10031838000292"></a>During Liverpool's celebrated year, we had everything on show. We had art that was highbrow, middlebrow and lowbrow. Indeed, part of its huge success was that some of the activities drew literally tens of thousands on people on to the streets of the city to see, for example, the extraordinary mechanical spider-La Machine-that crawled majestically through the streets of Liverpool only to end up disappearing down the Mersey tunnel. I met one father who took his little boy on his shoulders to see this mechanical beast, and when the young lad saw that the spider had gone down the Mersey tunnel, he told his dad he would never go down that tunnel again.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="10031838000293"></a>There were events to please the masses such as the Night of Liverpool Music, hosted by Paul McCartney in the football stadium at Anfield where, as dusk fell, 30,000 raised their baton torches to sing "Hey Jude". As you would expect, there was a lot of music to touch the soul, including the combined orchestras of Cologne and Liverpool gathering in my own cathedral to sing Benjamin Britten's "War Requiem". To think that less than 70 years ago these two European cities were scarred by mutual bombing, and here they were, joined in music and harmony, lamenting in unison the slaughter of Europe's young men and women.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="10031838000294"></a>In 2008, there were some 7,000 events in Liverpool, involving 10,000 artistes and 67,000 children. Some 160,000 community members participated in creative activities. There were 13 royal visits. One million hotel beds were sold, with hotel occupancy levels at 77 per cent. There were 3.5 million new visitors to the city and 15 million visits to a cultural event or attraction. It is estimated that the economic benefit to the Liverpool city region was in the region of £800 million, with 70 per cent of people from Liverpool visiting a museum or gallery.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="10031838000295"></a>These are just some of the statistics that give insight into the successful reach of the cultural programme. Such was its success in reaching inwards to its own people and outwards to a national and international audience that José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, said at the time:</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_713"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 713</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="10031838000420"></a>"It's turning out to be one of the most successful Capital of Culture programmes that we have ever had. We are now trying to create a network of European Capitals of Culture to build on Liverpool's experience".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000403"></a>This success could not have happened without the initiative of Liverpool City Council, the vision and expertise of the Culture Company and the investment and support of the Northwest Regional Development Agency.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="10031838000296"></a>I declare an interest in that I have recently become a trustee of National Museums Liverpool. In 2008, our museums and galleries attracted 2,736,701 visitors, which is the highest number on record, and more than three times as many as in 2001. What is most encouraging, however, are the statistics on the social inclusion programme of NML. Visitors from low socio-economic backgrounds have been increasing continually over the past five years so that numbers have increased from 442,401 to 780,068. This is what differentiates museums and galleries in provincial parts of the country from their sisters in London, which attract largely international audiences. We in the regions have a track record of penetrating our own communities, especially areas of deprivation, with our cultural heritage. This is one of the reasons why we must not treat such cultural services cavalierly and why they cannot be swept aside in times of economic stringency.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="10031838000297"></a>One of the areas I want to highlight, which is one of the reasons I sought to secure this debate, is not just to report on the economic impact of culture but to show how there is an inextricable link between good cultural services and the health and well-being of a community. Let me quote from a letter that I received from the chief executive of the NHS mental health service provider in north Merseyside, Mersey Care NHS Trust. He writes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="10031838000421"></a>"It is my opinion that culture in all its forms is a more significant contributor to health and well-being than direct formal services alone".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000404"></a>He has given me the example of 25 reading groups that have been set up through Mersey Care linked with the year of culture. He can identify people within these groups who otherwise would have needed in-patient care had it not been for the support and benefit of the groups. Groups cost about £6 per person per session; by comparison, an in-patient stay costs £9,000 on average.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="10031838000298"></a>Mersey Care NHS Trust has commissioned its own report on the benefit of cultural activities that were linked with Liverpool's year as capital of culture. This shows emphatically how, by entering into partnerships with a number of cultural organisations, the trust has been able to deliver a strategy of mental health and well-being that is having a significant and positive impact on mental health service users.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="10031838000299"></a>The trust was encouraged in its work by the then Secretary of State for Health who, in September 2008, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="10031838000422"></a>"Music, poetry, dance, drama and the visual arts have always been important to our mental and physical wellbeing, and collective participation and engagement in the arts is a fundamental element of any civilised society".</p>

<p><a name="10031838000405"></a>He added that the creative arts are not some kind of eccentric add-on,</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000431"></a>"but should be part of the mainstream in both health and social care".</ul>



<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_714"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 714</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="10031838000300"></a>The Mersey Care report cites a number of examples of creative partnerships such as those between the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts and the Broadoak acute psychiatric in-patient unit, and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and acute psychiatric in-patient units. The value of these creative partnerships is that participants reported improved mood and sense of well-being. Such is the success of these partnerships that Mersey Care has recognised that this is an opportunity to stimulate further its own engagement with the cultural sector.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="10031838000301"></a>As well as having a beneficial impact on health, cultural services also contribute to creating a more caring and compassionate society. If I might be allowed what at first appears to be a digression, I spend some of my time as bishop for prisons meeting and listening to offenders. The point that comes across time and again is that prisoners, without seeking to exonerate themselves, tell me that they had little or no understanding of the impact of their crime either on the victim or the victim's family, or even their own family. Criminal acts are often committed because of a failure of the imagination. As prisoners go through rehabilitation, education and cultural programmes, they have their imaginations stimulated and enlarged and begin to realise what they have done to others. Enabling them to begin to put themselves in the shoes of the victim is a vital step in correcting their behaviour.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="10031838000302"></a>I have seen prisoners get involved in drama exercises and speak about how their minds and hearts have been changed and opened to the full dimensions of their criminal behaviour, and this in itself has led them to change. It is the development of the imagination that is crucial to creating a caring and compassionate society. If people are not able to put themselves in the shoes of a victim, we end up creating a care-less and compassion-less world. The arts within our cultural services help to develop the imagination. That is why it is so important, especially in those areas of our society where people are deprived of the means of developing their imagination, to invest in our cultural services. I look forward to hearing the speeches of noble Lords, underlining the importance of culture as a front-line service.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="10031838000303"></a>In conclusion, at the beginning of Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture in 2008, I invited the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury to give a lecture in the Anglican cathedral on the role of faith in European culture. Some 2,000 people attended. By the way, the Catholic and Anglican cathedrals are two of the city's greatest cultural icons. Not only did they house some of the major musical, theatrical and artistic events and exhibitions, but our visitor numbers rose from 430,000 in 2007 to 530,000 in 2008, making the Anglican cathedral more visited than even Salisbury Cathedral, not that there is any competition. As you can imagine, his Grace the most reverend Primate explored the role of faith in cultivating a civilised society. He showed how instrumental it was in developing the arts, from music to novels and paintings to theatre. The arts both define and express our values as a civilisation. Although a stable and just economy is vital to our well-being, in the end there is more to life than money. Those other values are enshrined in our

We must be careful not to sacrifice our culture on the altar of the economy. If we do, we might find that we have lost more than we realise.</p>

I declare a familial interest in that my stepson is dean of Liverpool's Anglican cathedral. I have, of course, consulted him on the matters that I wish to raise.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="10031838000305"></a>It seems to me that we should do three things in this debate. First, we should celebrate Liverpool's year in 2008 as European Capital of Culture. Secondly, we should ask ourselves whether what happened there, which was marvellous, is sustainable and, if so, in what measure. Thirdly, we should ask ourselves whether what happened in Liverpool is a paradigm for other urban centres and rural areas in the United Kingdom and whether what was done in Liverpool can be transmitted in some form to encourage the creative industries in other areas of the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="10031838000306"></a>First, let me celebrate the success of Liverpool. I know that the right reverend Prelate will disapprove of the fact that I am going to read out some economic statistics, but they are pretty formidable. The additional visitor spend in Liverpool in 2008 as opposed to 2007, attributable directly to the European Capital of Culture experience, was £750 million. In 2008, over a third more people visited the city than in 2007. The socio-economic profile largely mirrored that in the city itself, so it was not a middle-class event. Liverpool had a much improved image in the media as a result of this-and it has suffered its knocks over the years. Eighty-five per cent of the population of the city thought that it was a better place in which to live than in 2007. That is a striking statistic, which shows that Liverpool is on the up. But is all this sustainable?</p>

<a name="100318-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="10031838000307"></a>In Liverpool at the moment, according to the research that the right reverend Prelate referred to, there are 1,683 creative industry enterprises, which employ 11,000 people. The multiplier on employment in the creative industries is therefore very great and we have hope there. The city itself has a strategy for 2008-13, which is a commitment by local government to continue the effort on creative industries in Liverpool. There is a clear understanding that culture has added value to already existing regeneration programmes. There is some hope for the future, therefore, but it depends on the commitment of local authorities and possibly central government to the idea that creative industries are part of regeneration programmes up and down the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="10031838000308"></a>Does the success of Liverpool offer a paradigm for other areas of the United Kingdom? There is a problem. With what is known now as the Cultural Olympiad and the attraction of London, Birmingham and Cardiff, there may be a danger of a lot of our cultural expertise tending to gravitate to where the audiences are. We have to accept that they are in the big urban areas. In Wales, Cardiff is an enormous centre for all the arts. There is also London, Birmingham, Manchester and

The question that I hope my noble friend will be able to answer is whether there is any way we can expand this into the rural areas, which up to now have felt rather deprived.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="10031838000309"></a>There is some hope. I am not dismissing this entirely. I cite the experience of Powys County Council. Powys is the largest county in the United Kingdom. It is rural and has no major towns, but it has Brecon. The Brecon Jazz Festival has become international and the Brecon baroque music festival has also just been recognised internationally. Powys has the Presteigne festival, too. It has theatres and an opera company. But above all it has a county council with a rural development plan that takes account of the creative industries in the area. There are not many of them, but part of this rural development plan is a project called Chance to Create, which will enhance the business side of creative industries in the county. It is run by two very energetic ladies-arts development officer Lucy Bevan and arts and culture manager Louise Ingham. They have managed to persuade the Welsh Assembly Government to get European Union money to support the business aspects of creative industries in Powys, with the multiplier on employment that that brings with it.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="10031838000310"></a>I am hopeful that, when he comes to wind up, my noble friend will say that, although this sort of organisation or enterprise is modest-it is not like those in Liverpool, London or Birmingham-it at least gives some idea that creative industries of the United Kingdom, whether they are in Wales, Scotland or England, will not be overlooked because of the inevitable tendency of London, Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool to attract the big hitters. I hope that I can get that assurance from my noble friend. While we celebrate the success of Liverpool as the European Capital of Culture, we must not forget that other areas of the United Kingdom need the creative industries as much as Liverpool does. Where Liverpool has set the example, I hope that others will be able to follow.</p>

I have no claim at all to cricket, apart from being scorer of the Eton second XI; even that put me into another profession. However, it is a great pleasure to the follow the noble Lord, Lord Williams; I call it first wicket down. It is an even greater pleasure to find with us this afternoon the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool, the author of this debate on culture and what it can do for that great city and its inhabitants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="10031838000312"></a>In 1984, in the course of other duties that came to me through your Lordships' House, I had close contact with a powerful religious gentleman down the Corridor; in fact, he is still the honourable Member for North Antrim. When this parliamentary colleague asked whether I ever read the Bible, I said, "Yes, I did stay awake last Sunday". I hope that the right reverend Prelate with us today will be able to correct me if I am wrong, but Matthew 22:20 has our Lord saying:</p>

I said that too many people thought that he was, which caused considerable disturbance in that area. The right reverend Prelate is the most marvellous representative of what I call the Caesar aspect and the city of Liverpool. Today, and on other occasions, he has given marvellous leadership in your Lordships' House. As for the other side of the coin, I will leave the Almighty to look on our venture today.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="10031838000313"></a>I declare an interest in the city of Liverpool, in that I have shares in an institution. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, will take cover when I say that the motto is "Nil satis nisi optimum", or "Only the best will do". That is probably the motto of, and certainly evinces the qualities shown by, both the right reverend Prelate and the city of Liverpool.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="10031838000314"></a>The right honourable lady the Member for Liverpool Wavertree, in the year of culture, organised an event in the Members' Dining Room of the other place. There were five boys and girls who came with cellos and at least one harp, if not two. They came from Kensington Junior School and the Sacred Heart Primary School to play in the Palace of Westminster under the guidance and at the instigation of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. That evening, I met the maestro Vasily Petrenko-I understand that that is how one can refer to the principal conductor of such an organisation. He corrected me on various aspects of Liverpool, music and his own career. It may have been him or other leading members of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic who started to encourage these five young boys and girls to take an interest in music, but, to follow the wonderful speech of the right reverend Prelate, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Vasily and the others responsible have unlocked the talent of those boys and girls-and, I suspect, of their parents and other people in that great city.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="10031838000315"></a>Indeed, I was given a briefing yesterday from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. A group called the West Everton Children's Orchestra visits two, three or four primary schools-I do not know how many. I understand that it is given blanket coverage and that an inordinate amount of interest is taken in music and instrumental activities. That is an aspect of culture, which we are discussing this afternoon. The West Everton Children's Orchestra is one of three such organisations in England; there is a similar organisation in the Stirling area of Scotland. Certainly, from what I saw in the Members' Dining Room in 2008, with the enormous success and enthusiasm under the cultural leadership of the great city of Liverpool, there is a feeling that youngsters and others can move out and, above all, unlock their talents and enjoy themselves.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="10031838000316"></a>The magnificent city of Liverpool is 300 miles from my home in the boondocks of Scotland. The first time I visited Liverpool, as part of my military duties, I went to a Scots Guards dinner with various others and did not get into too much trouble. I visited Liverpool again in 1965, when I went to the Grand National at Aintree. I remember sitting in the back of an open Land Rover. There was somebody with a placard, who may have a connection with the right reverend Prelate. He howled at me, "By their fruits ye shall know them". Today of all days, I return that instant volley to the right reverend Prelate; by what he has done, and is doing today, we know him, and we thank him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="10031838000317"></a>The other dates in my diary are 13 and 14 October 1967 and 11 November 1967, when occurred two great events in my life that caused me to have great love for the great city of Liverpool. It is not merely 300 miles from my home, or 200 miles from where we are now. A mere 20 metres away, in the Royal Gallery of your Lordships' House, we find a huge painting by Daniel Maclise. I understand that the measurements of the painting in the Royal Gallery are 18 feet tall by 54 feet wide. When I made a brief cultural visit to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool one morning, I had not necessarily been overindulging or done something dreadful, but I thought that I was familiar with that picture-the original of Daniel Maclise's "The Death of Nelson" is in there. I was certainly not surprised, but I was agreeably delighted that I could see in Liverpool paintings and culture of that nature.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="10031838000318"></a>I have referred to the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. I have been in the Philharmonic Hall not once but twice. Once, I even made a speech-I did not sing-in connection with an event with which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and the right reverend Prelate may be familiar. It was an awards ceremony at which I was invited to say a few words. I was proud and delighted to be there.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="10031838000319"></a>I thank the right reverend Prelate for showing us what can be done by unlocking the talents of the young people in Liverpool, as the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic has done. What was done in 2008 sowed the seeds for the future. I am very grateful to the right reverend Prelate for introducing the debate and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

I am delighted that the right reverend Prelate has chosen to develop this theme in the aftermath of the events, reviewing the outcome, assessing the lessons and looking ahead at the economic prospects and anticipated restraints on public spending.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="10031838000321"></a>That debate two years ago was a prologue to a celebration. We sang the praises of Liverpool and drew from our own personal experience. I was born and brought up in the city and was proud that it had won-rather to everyone's surprise-an ambitious programme of special events in what would be a very demanding year. However, I was anxious. In the course of preparations there had been some rough passages and arguments reorganising administration, with some leading participants dropping out and gaps among the plans. Liverpool's reputation had always been up and down. Could it really work? However, it did work. It was a triumph and a huge success for the people of the city, the north-west and for many visitors who had never before been to Liverpool. I was in a queue at the Klimt exhibition at the Tate Liverpool-that was seen as a world-class occasion-where I saw a very distinguished academic who rarely travelled outside Oxford. "What are you doing there?" I said rather foolishly. He said that he was enjoying his visit immensely and was staying for several days.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_719"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 719</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="10031838000322"></a>Another of my concerns was the possibility that for Liverpool culture meant only the Beatles, street parties and popular scouse comedians laughing through their tears. But in my formative years in Liverpool, when I played and watched football and listened to traditional jazz, I and my contemporaries had benefited greatly from libraries, the Walker Gallery, architecture, music and scholarship-high culture, as it is sometimes called. I hope that, two generations on, they will be encouraged and that people will be excited by them, thus opening up ideas and challenges. I made six separate trips to Liverpool and all the occasions met my criteria. I and my friends were tightly packed between St George's Hall and Lime Street Station when the music helped to launch the year. On another occasion, I watched fascinated and in pouring rain the extraordinary spider-like mechanical creature to which the right reverend Prelate referred, called La Machine or La Princesse. I am not sure whether it set off from the city centre. I also listened to the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle. It did not play music by Beethoven-an obvious choice-but an unusual and provocative piece of music that I-or, more relevantly, most of the audience-had never heard before. That certainly widened my cultural boundaries.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="10031838000323"></a>Now that it is all over, what next? I remember that, following the 1953 coronation festivities, David Low produced a famous cartoon with the caption, "Morning after". The ball was over-an unreal occasion-and the cost had been high. In a different context and time, I am much concerned about what will happen when the 2012 Olympics are over. When energy, enthusiasm and money are exhausted it will be all too easy to collapse with happy memories and not take essential further steps to regenerate and raise standards.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="10031838000324"></a>As the right reverend Prelate said, the City of Liverpool council, to its credit, commissioned a five-year research programme from the University of Liverpool-what I used to call the old university-and Liverpool John Moores University to examine Liverpool's experience and the impact on it of being the European Capital of Culture. As has been said, the report was published last week. It is rigorous and disciplined although analytical rather than prescriptive. I will not repeat all the details as the report is available through the Library. However, the programme had an income of £130 million over the six years to and including 2008. It attracted 10 million additional visits to Liverpool and these generated more than £750 million for Liverpool, Merseyside and the region. Of the 2.6 million European and global visits, 97 per cent were first-time visits. As for what the report calls "cultural access", one-third of the audience was local and during the period 2006-08, there was a 10 per cent rise in each year, and in 2008, 11 per cent of Liverpool residents "tried something new".</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="10031838000325"></a>Over the years, Liverpool has often had a very negative profile in newspapers, on the radio and on television. However, most of us who followed the coverage during the year found that it was positive-initially cautious but wholehearted later. The report concludes that Liverpool has undergone "a remarkable image renaissance", and that,</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000432"></a>"levels of confidence have been raised across the city".</ul>



<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_720"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 720</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="10031838000407"></a>It says that culture,</p>
<ul><a name="10031838000433"></a>"is more widely accepted as a driver for economic change, health and social inclusion".</ul>
<p><a name="10031838000408"></a>At several points it refers warmly to partnership. I agree very much with the right reverend Prelate on that matter. Speaking personally, I think that partnership will be essential in the years ahead because religion and politics have often divided the city. For the past 10 years or so there has been welcome relative stability. The council showed imagination and strength in carrying through the programme. I hope that all parties will build on Liverpool's success because there are very many tasks ahead. Unemployment is high and, as the report shows, skill levels are low. Household income rose 40 per cent over a decade, but Liverpool remains one of the poorest cities in the country. I welcome the intention announced earlier this week to develop an Atlantic gateway covering the hinterland of both Liverpool and Manchester. In 1997, the Government of the day published a famous report, <I>Change or Decay</I>. I still have a copy. There has not been enough constructive change over those years.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="10031838000326"></a>In 1945, I campaigned as a sixth-former during the general election where I lived and close to my school, Quarry Bank. In Liverpool there were 11 parliamentary constituencies, one of them uncontested with only 21,000 voters whose single candidate was carried from street to street on a horse-drawn cart. In the forthcoming election there will be only four parliamentary constituencies, each with five, six or more candidates. I hope that all these candidates will congratulate those who put together Liverpool's year of European Capital of Culture and, more importantly, strongly support the culture of the city and the growth of its vital constructive industries.</p>

But the answer in politics is that it does not mean that you should not say it. Several things originally attracted me to speak in this debate. When I was still looking forward to my 30th birthday, I made several visits to Glasgow during its year as a city of culture. I remember the buzz of being there, although it is true that I was still young enough to enjoy the buzz without feeling like death warmed up the next day; such are the memories of youth. Glasgow gained a degree of confidence and took pleasure in enjoying itself. The whole city stopped being miserable.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="10031838000328"></a>Glasgow and Liverpool come from the same industrial past. They both have a wonderful series of galleries, museums and so on which were provided for them by 19th century philanthropists who made their money out of the industries of the day. They both have incredibly well kept cultural secrets. Indeed, many people outside this place probably say, "Don't tell people about the galleries and museums. We won't be able to get into them as easily". There was a sense that the museums and galleries were not for the people who lived in those cities: they were well kept secrets.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="10031838000329"></a>I am afraid that I did not get to Liverpool during its year of culture, but what we saw on television and  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_721"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 721</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what I read showed that the cheerfulness happened again, but on a bigger scale. Local people were encouraged to take part in events and to build on what was already there. Indeed, telling people what is already there is probably the most important task. There is no point in holding an event if you do not tell everyone it is going to happen. That can be overdone, and I have personal experience of that from my own party conference just after the competition was announced. I found myself chairing a meeting-I do not know why, and I do not think the people who organised the meeting knew why I was chairing it either, but these things happen at party conferences. It was late at night, and I suggested that ordinary, grassroots sport might not have the biggest contribution to make to culture. I was told that it could make a contribution because there would be festivals with lots of small children from football teams celebrating them. My definition of sport does not really stretch to having children running around, but the idea that everything was possible was an infectious one within the group. It was comprised of councillors from the one of the dominant political parties in the city, so it is not surprising that such a degree of enthusiasm was able to permeate.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="10031838000330"></a>Once enthusiasm gets going, you are okay, but it has to be backed up with investment and structural support in order to go out and reach people. That becomes clear when you read the information: things must be well organised. This takes me to the Olympics. If we do not see the Olympics as anything other than the high point of a series of well planned big events that generate income and enthusiasm, we are missing a trick. Those running the Cultural Olympiad will be particularly trying to reach out beyond London through different sorts of structures, and so will face slightly different problems. What they have said very clearly is this: you have to keep your nerve when planning something. It was the underlying lesson they had learnt.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="10031838000331"></a>Journalists and indeed even politicians sometimes have been waiting for the big disaster with the Olympics so that they can say, "Oh, it shouldn't have happened". Holding one's nerve is apparently very important, and certainly that is the impression I was given. You must make sure that you carry on with the building programme so you can look back to what is good about it. I am always keen on people pointing out what has not worked out too well. Admitting to a few mistakes that you will try to change is a great way of building confidence. It is better than trying to pretend that everything is wonderful all the time, because we know that does not happen. Success, even when it is great success, is still relative; you could have done better.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="10031838000332"></a>It is important to think about how to generate a high level of enthusiasm. By all accounts, and I am looking at this from the outside, Liverpool seemed to be able to create a feeling that something good, positive and of its very own was happening. If we can learn how to reproduce that feeling, we will be doing very well. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, pointed out that this happens on a smaller scale in other places using specialist units. We must think about how to generate it in other parts of the country. How should we build on the work of our festivals? Turning back to the Scottish connection, the Edinburgh Festival takes place every year. Although the good burghers of Edinburgh  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_722"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 722</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are probably sick of unicycling jugglers after a week or two, it is clear that people still enjoy the festival. They know that it generates enthusiasm. If there is a structure that lets people know what is happening, other benefits come from that. Employment is generated, there is a positive attitude and a can-do mentality that is not exclusive. Those who are on the front line must be backed up.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="10031838000333"></a>That is surely the biggest lesson to learn. Support must be given to those who do the planning, and you must ensure that you make people feel involved. If you do not, all exercises in mass participation will be limited in their success and unable to reach their full potential for enhancing their localities. We must always remember to back up good works.</p>

There is a national obsession with trying to find fault, but one of the things that we learned from Liverpool is that, as my noble friend said, if we get behind the people and the planners involved in the Olympics and the Cultural Olympiad, we will have a great national success and generate the same boost of confidence nationally as Liverpool has had from being the capital of culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="10031838000335"></a>I pay tribute to the right reverend Prelate for obtaining this debate. If he came to the McNally household on some Sunday mornings he would find me doing the Sunday fry-up and singing,</p>
 "We live in a city exceedingly fair,We speak with an accent exceedingly rare,If you want a cathedral, we have one to spare,In my Liverpool home".
<p><a name="10031838000409"></a>That is usually followed by shouts from my children: "Oh for God's sake, shut up, Dad". That is due to the quality of my voice.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="10031838000336"></a>My background and locus for speaking in this debate is that my parents were born in Old Swan in Liverpool at the turn of the last century. I grew up with Liverpool being the first big city of which I was aware, and I still have the sense of visiting Liverpool in its pomp in the 1950s. I also grew up with some knowledge of the legacy of the religious divide in the city. My parents talk of Liverpool in the early 20th century and the religious bigotry there. Sometimes when people tell me that areas in Northern Ireland or elsewhere cannot overcome such a divide, I say, "Well, look at Liverpool. Look at the way that those kinds of divisions are part of its history". The fact that Liverpool has overcome it is due in no small measure to the leadership of its churches. I do not think that we have a cathedral to spare, because the leadership of those two cathedrals at either end of Hope Street-how well named is that street which connects them-has been the driving force for leaving religious bigotry behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="10031838000337"></a>My other contact with Liverpool was, first, as a north-west MP in the early 1980s, and then when working on a project for the Government Office for

It might be worth recapping some of the findings of the study that I carried out. There was a massive lack of community pride and identity. There was the appalling media image, to which my noble friend Lord Rodgers and the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, referred. There was a sense of grievance and neglect. I was in Liverpool on the day that Mrs Thatcher resigned. If there had been an instant vote, Mr Heseltine would have been elected, because he seemed to have been the only politician in the past decade who had taken an interest in Liverpool. Although the garden festival was a one-off and did not leave a tremendous legacy, the effort that he made at the time was appreciated. I also remember from my survey something that has changed. I had asked what contribution the university made to Liverpool. One respondent shook his head and said, "The university is the castle on the hill. It doesn't get involved in the problems of the city". That is no longer true. All three universities are deeply involved.</p>

<a name="100318-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="10031838000338"></a>When the culture bid was made, we received the usual media sneers. As my noble friend Lord Rodgers said, there was the fear that Liverpool has a tradition of being able to shoot itself in the foot. There were fears that, for either political or community reasons, the people involved would not hold together. There were a few stumbles and bumps on the way, but they held together magnificently, and the result has been not only a success during the year itself but a tremendous permanent legacy for others to look at. It has to be said that that was partly helped not only by the leadership of the council but by support from national and regional government, which kept the project on track.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="10031838000339"></a>Liverpool today, as a cultural centre, has the good hotels that modern visitors need. It has good restaurants, good transport links and good shopping. It provides a good visitor experience. It has an excellent conference centre and some great examples of regeneration. To see the restored St George's Hall is a tremendous feeling. Literally billions of pounds of new investment have been put into Liverpool over the past 10 years and the results are there to see. It makes one feel that culture, in its widest sense, can be used as a successful regenerator: Liverpool is a good example. However, there is the question of what comes next. Warren Bradley, the leader of Liverpool City Council, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="10031838000424"></a>"The last decade has seen Liverpool undergo one of the biggest transformations enjoyed by any city in recent times. There is a determination that Liverpool will forge ahead with its regeneration through strong leadership and partnership working. Our presence at this year's World Expo 2010 in Shanghai-the only UK city to be represented-gives us a great opportunity to attract more tourists and students, further investment and showcase Liverpool to the world".</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="10031838000340"></a>I came to this debate from a lunch hosted by KPMG for the new Chinese ambassador. It could not have been in greater contrast to an occasion in 1981, when I went as one of the north-west MPs to a conference organised by Granada on the state of the city of Liverpool. The city was on its knees, with all confidence drained out of it. Now Liverpool will be Britain's city representative at the World Expo opening in Shanghai in seven weeks' time. It is brimming with

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="10031838000341"></a>As the right reverend Prelate said, becoming the Capital of Culture was seen as a success, but the cultural programme continues. This year there will be a 12-month celebration of dance; a One City, One Goal football tournament as part of the 2018 World Cup bid; an On the Waterfront festival of dance; maritime art; the Tate Picasso exhibition; the Mathew Street Music Festival; and hundreds of other grassroots events. As well as these events-I will not repeat what others have said-the investment in the Liverpool Knowledge Quarter and the Liverpool Science Park builds on recent success. The first national museum in 100 years is being built on Liverpool's historic waterfront. The Museum of Liverpool will open in 2011. Liverpool City Council is also bidding to become a UNESCO City of Music, bringing together the traditions and worldwide fame of both the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the Beatles. I have mentioned the key part that the city is playing in the World Cup bid. So as well as the tremendous success of the year itself, which has been referred to, Liverpool is retaining the momentum and carrying on using its cultural heritage, and the investment that has been made, to project itself forward. This is also to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="10031838000342"></a>The concept that motivated the bid-the world in one city-is one from which lessons can be learned about cultural diversity. It is no surprise that Liverpool is going to Shanghai: it has one of the oldest Chinese communities in Britain, as well as a long-standing relationship with that great city. The multiculturalism of Liverpool was also marvellously enjoyed and experienced during the City of Culture year itself. Again, it built on and repaired what in the past were often damaged race relations.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="10031838000343"></a>I welcome the opportunity to revisit this subject. We in this House often talk about post-legislative scrutiny. Today we have had some post-event scrutiny. The report that we can deliver on the effort made in the Capital of Culture year is that those of us who had confidence in Liverpool had our confidence justified; and also that the lesson that we can learn now as we move forward to the Cultural Olympiad and other events is that culture and the creative arts can be tremendously important in raising the morale and confidence of a community, and can also be important wealth-creators and job-creators in their own right. My dad lived in exile in Blackpool for much of his life, but he was always a proud Scouser, and he would be proud of his city today.</p>

It seems amazing that it is already two years since this great event. I believe that it has had considerable results.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="10031838000345"></a>As we all know, the title European Capital of Culture was designed to help bring European citizens closer together. It might surprise some noble Lords to know  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_725"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 725</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that since 1985, more than 30 cities have been awarded this title-from Stockholm to Genoa, Athens to Glasgow, Krakow to Porto; and then, in 2008, Liverpool beat five other British hopefuls to become the host city. What a fabulous host Liverpool was, and is. I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and commemorate straight away my noble friend Lord Heseltine's involvement and instrumental role in Liverpool's regeneration. We do not believe that the city would have been in anywhere near the correct state to receive such a tremendous honour as European Capital of Culture without all the work, time and interest that he had previously invested in the city.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="10031838000346"></a>I was privileged to be entertained by the local authorities in Liverpool in the run-up to 2008, and I was very impressed with the spirit and enthusiasm that I encountered on all sides. I was also lucky to visit some of the great showplaces in Liverpool which have been mentioned this afternoon, most notably the Walker Gallery, the Maritime Museum and St. George's Hall-a super building of which I had never really heard before, but I have now. I have to state my interest as a dealer in watercolours and to say how many superb works of art I was shown in Liverpool.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="10031838000347"></a>We can all agree that Liverpool as the European City of Culture was, and continues to be, a huge success, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, emphasised. It holds the largest collection of Grade II listed buildings outside London and has one of the best collections of European art in Britain outside London. It has the fifth largest cathedral in the world and has been a location for some 140 films in the past year alone-most of which I fear passed me by.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="10031838000348"></a>From a tourism perspective, it is estimated that visitors to the city totalled nearly 10 million in 2008 and more than 18 million across the four years of the build-up programme. Thirty-five per cent of all visits to Liverpool were influenced by the title European Capital of Culture, with many making a trip to the city for the first time. From 2007 to 2008 there was a growth in overall numbers and significant increases in both national and international visitor numbers, split roughly between 1.5 million from the UK and 300,000 from abroad. From a business perspective, the financial impact just from tourism based on estimated direct spend stood at some £753 million. Major developments during the period, accompanied by public realm and infrastructure improvements, transformed Liverpool's office quarter to offer a modern and attractive business environment. The commercial district was set to be expanded with 1.75 million square feet of new, high quality office space, making Liverpool one of the UK's fastest growing business destinations. Furthermore, retail space at the Paradise Street and Metquarter developments has been designed to re-establish Liverpool as a top class national retail destination. The Paradise project is now Europe's largest retail development and has created an extra 1 million square feet of new shopping floor space.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="10031838000349"></a>Of course, this amazing business expansion has created thousands of new jobs. Within the arts and cultural sector alone-of which in 2008 there were a staggering 1,683 creative-industry enterprises, representing  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_726"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 726</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a growth of 8 per cent in the number of enterprises over the 2004-08 period-a phenomenal 10,987 people were employed, which accounted for around 3 to 4 per cent of the overall workforce in the city.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="10031838000350"></a>All these factors combined have led to an enhanced image of Liverpool, not just for the national and international visitors who have come to the city but also, I believe, for the people of Liverpool themselves. My noble friend Lord Lyell said that only the best will do, and I think that that has been the guiding light during the build-up to the City of Culture-and since then as well. It is well known that, sadly, the city of Liverpool attracted very high levels of negative UK national media coverage for most of the second half of the 20th century, and that was also reflected in negative preconceptions of the city at a national level. However, since the European Capital of Culture title award in 2003, there have been some remarkable changing trends in media coverage about the city, and in national as well as local perceptions. It has undergone a remarkable image renaissance, locally, nationally and internationally. Local opinion leaders give more credibility to the city's cultural assets and to the cultural sector as a source of civic leadership. National media in the mainstream, as well as in specialist domains, are now used to presenting a richer picture of Liverpool as a multifaceted and contemporary city with world class assets and an ability to build on them. Internationally, the city has been rediscovered as a tourist destination, and rightly so.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="10031838000351"></a>Because of its time as Capital of Culture, levels of confidence have been raised across the city. Strong partnerships have been developed. There are greater opportunities to retain local talent, bring in new ideas, attract external investment and further develop the range and quality of what the city can offer. All these have increased at an incredible rate. It just goes to show, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said, how important culture is as a driver for economic change and social inclusion.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="10031838000352"></a>Being European Capital of Culture has put Liverpool on the heritage map and alerted people to the city's status as a world heritage city. But we must not become complacent. We must now look forward and ensure that this most tremendous start retains its momentum.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="10031838000353"></a>I have a couple of questions to put to the Minister. As I said, being European City of Culture has had a remarkably positive effect on the portrayal of Liverpool in the media for the duration of the cultural offerings, shifting the primary focus from stories about football and crime. To what extent has this been a permanent change in the perception of the city? How, from now on, will the Government support Liverpool residents so that they may continue upholding their new reputation?</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="10031838000354"></a>Liverpool City Council invested an additional 84 per cent in the arts between 2002-03 and 2008-09. What plans are there to ensure that the city's artistic endeavours are not left with a funding shortfall now the official events of the year are over?</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="10031838000355"></a>The internet and online social networking sites are fast becoming a key marketing method with which to reach the largest number of people. The ECoC in Liverpool is a successful example of how this new

How are these tools being utilised to promote other UK cities at home and abroad? Finally, what lessons, from the successful delivery of Liverpool as the ECoC, can and will be taken forward to the implementation of the Cultural Olympiad?</p>

The House has been indebted for a considerable time to the Bishops of Liverpool; the right reverend Prelate will be all too well aware of the impact that his predecessor, David Sheppard, made while he graced these Benches as Lord Sheppard. We are delighted that the right reverend Prelate is carrying on that most constructive tradition.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="10031838000357"></a>I need to declare an interest, as I participated to a limited degree in the development of the city of culture. I played a particular part in the opening of the museum of slavery, which I know is now one of those greatly visited museums in Liverpool. I had the great joy of being at the opening ceremony when Paul Robeson Jr played a star part; there is a name to conjure with. Consequently, I have the fondest recollections of the beginning of that year and I am delighted that the right reverend Prelate was able to identify the benefits that flowed from that year. He is of course right that there were economic benefits; it was not quite £800 million, but our figure is not far shy of that in terms of economic benefit to the area.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="10031838000358"></a>I can tell my noble friend Lord Williams that it is not possible for those figures to be generated without having an impact on the surrounding areas as well. I do not just mean the Wirral; everybody knows the significance that the city of Liverpool plays in relationship to the adjoining areas of north Wales and so on, to say nothing of the hinterland of Lancashire and Cheshire, so the fact that the city plays the key part as a city of culture is not to underestimate the spin-off to the rural areas. However, I accept his point: we need to attend to the rural positions. I should indicate to him that that is very much in the Government's mind at present, as we are working with the Rural Cultural Forum to look at how to build up the rural need for cultural provision. We all know the challenges-the big investment that is possible in cities will not be possible in the same way in rural areas-but I am very grateful to my noble friend for identifying the fact that we need to develop the non-urban areas.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="10031838000359"></a>Perhaps I might also give a note of optimism on another front, that of my noble friend's more distant point in the debate. The rural area of the south-west of England, which is not quite so distinguished for its large cities, has an important part for the creative industries at present. We are seeing that flourishing against the background that the right reverend Prelate identified at the beginning: the importance of the cultural industries as far as the economy of the city of Liverpool is concerned. However, that is also true of Liverpool being emblematic of the creative industries in relation to the whole country's economy.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_728"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 728</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="10031838000360"></a>In this last decade of significant growth in the British economy, one very significant matter is how much greater a proportion the creative industries are contributing. The Government have played their key part in supporting that development. Perhaps I might emphasise one dimension; one of the first acts that we set about, as soon as we came into power in 1997, was to end the fees for museum entrances. We all know the impact that that creative diversion has had in terms of visits to museums, and therefore on the increased experience of that dimension of our culture. One encouraging thing about it is that the sociological evidence also indicates that free museum entrance has increased attendances at art galleries. There is significant growth, among those sections of the population of whom it might have been said, in the past, that they showed the least predilection to go into museums and galleries. That is also an important spin-off from that concept.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="10031838000361"></a>On the success of Liverpool-I am glad that the right reverend Prelate presaged this in a gentle way in his introduction-those who are a little more forthright and almost as knowledgeable about the city, such as the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Rogers, said that there was a fairly shaky start to the year of culture. I have a wonderful quote from Phil Redmond, who played such a significant part in picking up what was at its early stages very limited momentum. He said that the whole process was a bit like a Scouse wedding: all over the place at the beginning, but everybody got their act together by the end. That is how it felt with Liverpool. I remember a debate in this House after Liverpool had won the designation but before the plans had been established with any security and the anxieties reflected at that time-anxieties which, happily, were entirely ill founded.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="10031838000362"></a>One of the spin-offs is that we now have a competition for the British city of culture, which is engendering keen competition among British cities for our version of the European dimension. We are all too well aware of the fact that we cannot monopolise the European city of culture in quite the same way that we hope to do with the European Cup in football because slightly different factors are at play. The European city of culture concept will be shared among the nations of Europe, but we want the stimulus that meant so much to Liverpool to occur frequently among our cities.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="10031838000363"></a>To respond to the noble Lord, Lord Luke, we have not the slightest doubt that we need support for the arts and culture in our big cities, especially Liverpool. There are difficult economic times ahead for public expenditure, and we appreciate that local authorities, including city authorities, will be under constraints over the next few years. Margaret Hodge, my colleague in the department in the other place, has made absolutely clear that she expects constant support for the arts and cultural organisations in this difficult period, because they produce the advantages which the right reverend Prelate emphasised.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="10031838000364"></a>It is not just a question of economic activity; there are also the benefits to be felt from the experience of a strengthening culture of optimism, of a feeling of creativity and of improvements in mental health. The right reverend Prelate identified those aspects of well-being.  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_729"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 729</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We might have been less aware of this a decade or so ago, but recent research has shown that the rehabilitation of offenders and how we improve the response of prisoners and those who have fallen into crime can be helped by increased exposure to cultural activities.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="10031838000365"></a>This has been an exceedingly positive debate. I expected that from the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Rodgers, because of their association with the city. I was very grateful for what the noble Lords, Lord Addington and Lord Lyell, had to say. Both of them emphasised morale. It is always difficult to mention one Liverpool football club without mentioning another, so I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, on mentioning one, and I was pleased that he mentioned the Latin tag of Everton, which has got it right. I went to a school where it was intended to say exactly that-"Nothing but the best"-but it translated literally as, "Nothing, but you couldn't do better", which was not quite the intention. That was poorer Latin, so I am grateful to Everton for at least improving in that respect.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="10031838000366"></a>When we talk about culture today, we have a tendency to do so in terms of the arts, museums and art galleries and the year of culture. But Liverpool would not be our Liverpool without our appreciation of three facets of culture which are of the greatest importance. One is certainly music. Liverpool is a city of popular music; for a long time it was the world capital of popular music, and as a consequence we should recognise what a significant part it has in the city. Secondly, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for emphasising this, for a very long time Liverpool has inevitably been associated with association football and the strength of commitments in those areas. The other aspect is that dimension which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, sought to capture, as did the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers; the noble Lord, Lord Addington, actually gave phrase to it as "holding your nerve". It is rather more than that: it is the ability to triumph over adversity, and the expectation that certain things are not going to run easily your way.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="10031838000367"></a>It is a long time since Liverpool enjoyed the fruits of exceptional economic standing in the United Kingdom. The great days of the 19th century and the relationship with the United States and so on are long since gone. But Liverpool has always come through because of its people. Even when the going is tough the very best is brought out of them, not least with that characteristic, rather disparaging Scouse humour. These are all parts of the culture of this city which we are here to celebrate for having made such a success of that year and set an example which others have to follow.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="10031838000368"></a>Certain noble Lords associated Liverpool with Glasgow, the second city to have been awarded the European Capital of Culture. They also have a great deal in common in their undoubted greatness. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred to the great benefactors of the past. These city benefactors reflected very considerable wealth in the city which was the product of the great successes of the 19th century. This is also true of Glasgow. Both cities have had to adjust to the rather different economic circumstances of the second half of the 20th century and now the beginning of the 21st century, and in that respect both  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_730"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 730</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of them have shown that capacity to fight back, sustain their culture and meet the challenges which lie before them. None of us would underestimate those challenges.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="10031838000369"></a>I emphasise that none of this would have been so successful without a very deep commitment by government to the concept of culture and its significance in our national life. It is often emphasised in economic terms, and so it should be. Well-being is an important dimension and can be measured in many ways, but it is difficult to have well-being if one is suffering economically. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Luke, said about the gestures the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, made towards Liverpool, and that he emphasised that he wanted to make a contribution to the city's recovery. It needed recovery after that time. In a decade or so when this land was scarred with joblessness, Liverpool suffered as much as any significant city. We can all recall the 1980s as a decade of very considerable stress and strain in the city, and of joblessness. One of the features of the past decade is the extent to which job creation has aided the city, not least in the important area of the creative industries and the opportunities which are produced through cultural developments.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="10031838000370"></a>I go on to another dimension of culture which was not mentioned this afternoon, although I know if he had had more time the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, would without doubt have addressed it. We have had very significant architectural developments in our cities, and Liverpool is one of the beneficiaries of this. It always had the grandeur of its 19th century buildings, but it has had some very striking developments in recent years. We should appreciate the extent of architectural achievement-particularly in our great cities with waterfronts, where modern architecture is in many ways enhanced by and enhances the waterfront. Liverpool has been the beneficiary of that development, too. Let me say how important that aspect of art and culture is to the well-being of people, because there is no doubt that the spatial environment in which one exists is very important to morale. I think that Liverpudlians these days glory in the fact that the city looks so fine in so many significant parts of its environment.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="10031838000371"></a>There are so many more points that one could cover. I want to capture what has been expressed on all sides of the House. The noble Lord, Lord Luke, asked me one or two waspish questions about the future. He is right to address himself to that. I think I could speak with a little more confidence, if the roles were reversed, about what will sustain Liverpool's future, but I stress that we will continue to place great emphasis on protecting and increasing the number of jobs that will help to preserve people's economic well-being. Many of those jobs will be in the creative industries and in culture, which is the feature of this debate, and we will seek to be fair to deprived parts of our society. As ever, a very large number of deprived people live in our great cities, and Liverpool still has areas of real deprivation which need attention.</p>

<a name="100318-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="10031838000372"></a>I emphasise to the noble Lord, Lord Luke, that I would be naive not to recognise that local authorities will face considerable pressure in the future, but we are concerned that the arts and cultural development should play their full part in the community. I come full circle

They are also about morale, well-being and pride in the area in which one lives and in the role that one plays. That is the lesson to learn from Liverpool's city of culture year.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="10031838000375"></a>In the past decade, the Government have substantially improved help for new parents, especially by increasing maternity pay and leave and by introducing both paid paternity leave and adoption leave. A growing number of fathers, however, are keen to be more heavily involved in raising their child during its first year. As it stands, all employed mothers and adopters are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity or adoption leave, 39 of which may be paid. Fathers, though, can claim just two weeks of paid paternity leave. It makes clear sense to provide fathers with greater opportunities to spend time with their baby. When fathers are instrumental in the upbringing of children, those children do better in school and are less likely to get caught up in criminal activity. In cases where mothers earn more money than their partner, greater flexibility in childcare arrangements could have a significant impact on the family income.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="10031838000376"></a>These regulations will entitle fathers to up to six months of leave to care for a child where the child's mother, or primary adopter, returns to work without using her full entitlement to maternity or adoption leave. Some of this leave may be paid if taken during  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_732"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 732</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the mother's statutory maternity pay period. The six instruments that we are examining today are part of a package that will ensure that the scheme is consistent with existing statutory payments and covers all employees. In line with this, the rate of pay will be linked to the basic rate of statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance, statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption pay. Right now, this is £123.06 per week. It rises to £124.88 next month for all these statutory payments.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="10031838000377"></a>The effectiveness of these regulations depends on them applying across all organisations, irrespective of size. The Government recognise the concerns of some small businesses regarding further regulation. We recognise that the absence of staff in a small company could have a disproportionate impact, although our estimates are that less than 1 per cent of small businesses will be affected in any one year. For this reason, small businesses will be able to recover 104.5 per cent of statutory payments made, as they can already for statutory maternity, paternity and adoption pay.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="10031838000378"></a>In addition, we have consciously designed the scheme to be light-touch, by building on existing arrangements for employees who take ordinary paternity leave. Parents will be able to self-certify their entitlement and to provide details which will allow employers to calculate their own entitlement. Our goal is to reduce the administrative and financial burden on SMEs. However, a light touch is not the same as a soft touch. We believe that the system proposed presents minimal risk of fraud and abuse. As with other statutory payments, we will conduct compliance checks and impose financial penalties on those who break the law.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="10031838000379"></a>We have taken one further step to address the concerns of some employers, by delaying the introduction of these regulations. They will come into effect for parents of babies due from April 2011, giving businesses an extra year to prepare for the change. We are already working with employers to ensure that they are ready. Guidance will be publicly available well before the implementation date. We estimate that around 400,000 men a year will qualify for additional paternity leave: 400,000 fathers who will have the opportunity, should they so wish, to play a more central role in what is arguably the most critical year of a child's life.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="10031838000380"></a>These regulations are indicative of the Government's commitment to families, to fairness and to choice at work. I commend them to the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="10031838000381"></a><b><a name="100318-0011.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10031838000644"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for explaining these regulations. As noble Lords will know, we on these Benches place considerable importance on the institution of the family, whether or not within a marriage, because we believe strongly in the importance of a stable and committed relationship as the best basis for bringing up a child. We are therefore sympathetic to giving parents flexibility, including in the context of parental leave, provided a sensible and pragmatic balance is struck with the interests of the employer. The Minister referred to this himself.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="10031838000382"></a>I was an employer myself until a few years ago and I well remember a situation where one of our employees became pregnant and took maternity leave. We were very anxious to make life as easy as possible for her, not least because we were keen to have her back when  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_733"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 733</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>she was ready to come back, so what I say now should be seen in the light of my understanding of the need for a balance.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="10031838000383"></a>Our concerns are in the following areas. First, a welter of employment law-I think a dozen separate pieces-will come into force in 2011. Will the Minister kindly explain how the detail of all of that coming into force has been, or will be, carefully explained to employers, to make it as easy as possible for them to understand and abide by it?</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="10031838000384"></a>Secondly, I understand that EU directives dealing with parental leave and with pregnant workers are imminent. Can the Minister say what is the expected timing of this, what the expected requirements of these directives are and how they will tie in with the regulations we are dealing with today?</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="10031838000385"></a>Thirdly, yesterday in another place my honourable friend Jonathan Djanogly raised the issue of the extent to which the employer has an obligation to verify that someone posing as a father is indeed the relevant father. Confirmation of the position on that from the Minister would be helpful.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="10031838000386"></a>Lastly, a question that was not raised in another place yesterday is how the employer of one parent-say, the father-is supposed to know that the other parent, the mother, is not also claiming simultaneously. Related to that, what is the obligation on the employer of a father to give him parental leave if the wife is not working?</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="10031838000387"></a>As I have said, we are sympathetic to giving parents flexibility in the context of parental leave, so I look forward to the Minister's responses on these points.</p>

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="10031839000001"></a><b><a name="100318-0011.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031839000078"></a>Lord Cotter:</b> My Lords, taken overall, these measures are to be welcomed, which we do from these Benches. Some people will have concerns about the details but the principles are right. I am glad, though, that the Minister referred to small businesses when he introduced them.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="10031839000002"></a>As has been said so often, it is unfair that one parent, the mother, has to take the full burden of looking after a child and unfair that many fathers are desperate to spend more time with their child but are just unable to do so. I am not sure where this statistic comes from, but it is said that nearly two-thirds of fathers think that they should spend more time caring for their child or children. On that basis, it could also be said that one-third of fathers do not share this outlook. That is as it may or may not be, but, by changing the present situation, as it becomes the norm for fathers to have the opportunity of sharing the parental role, these measures in themselves over time will, one hopes, encourage fathers who are not engaged to think more about their role in life.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="10031839000003"></a>There is a lot of concern about how children are brought up. From time to time we see the results of parenting that is failing or is not up to the mark, such as dysfunctional families or disturbed youngsters, and the social impact that they have on society. These measures encourage fathers to take part and encourage both parents to share the load.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="10031839000004"></a>Welcome as they are, though, it is important that for paternity and maternity rules there should be clarity. The Minister spoke about guidance. I say from  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_734"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 734</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these Benches that this is an important issue. I have raised concerns in the past, as the Minister may be aware, about the detail and the length of guidance that is given. In this connection, I refer the Minister particularly to a document entitled <I>Terms and Conditions of Employment: The Additional Statutory Paternity Pay (Weekly Rates) Regulations 2010</I>. On the first page, under the heading, "Weekly rate of payment of additional statutory paternity pay", it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="10031839000064"></a>"The weekly rate of payment of additional statutory paternity pay shall be the smaller of the following two amounts- (a) £124.88; (b) 90 per cent of the normal weekly earnings of the person claiming".</p>

<p><a name="10031839000005"></a>In effect, it is saying £124.88 or 90 per cent of the normal weekly earnings.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="10031839000006"></a>I may have got this wrong, but on the second page, under the heading, "Explanatory note"-for further explanation and clarification, I take it-it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="10031839000065"></a>"Regulation 2 sets the weekly rate of payment of additional statutory paternity pay at the smaller of £124.88 and 90 per cent of the employee's normal weekly earnings"-</p>

<p><a name="10031839000060"></a>rather than "or", so someone will be getting £124.88 plus 90 per cent of their normal weekly earnings. The Minister's officials may be able to help him in this respect. If I have got this wrong, then I am sure that someone will put me right; if not, I would hope the Minister will take it on board and see that it is corrected, because it calls the accuracy of the guidance into question. I have already raised the issue of the Inland Revenue website and how employers and others have difficulty finding the specific guidance they need. The website needs to be improved; and if this information should be included, it would appear to be contradictory. I therefore hope for a response from the Minister either now or in the future.</p>

<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="10031839000007"></a><b><a name="100318-0011.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10031839000079"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> My Lords, with those contributions we have clearly made up in quality what we lacked in quantity. I had thought that my reply could be very short, but it seems that it might take a little longer-the points raised by noble Lords merit an answer and I will try to deal with them all.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="10031839000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, expressed his welcome sympathy for the approach but raised a number of understandable issues, for example how paternity leave and pay will impact on employers, particularly SMEs. The timings for introducing the scheme have been chosen to give employers a longer lead-in period to allow them to understand and prepare for the legislation. We believe that implementation in April 2011 provides a suitable period for businesses to prepare effectively for the additional paternity leave. We have designed the administration of the scheme to be as light touch as possible to minimise the burden placed on businesses, as I said, and to give them an opportunity to claim back more than the 104.5 per cent of additional statutory paternity pay payments or the 92 per cent which can be claimed by larger employers.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="10031839000009"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the risk of fraud and the responsibility of employers. HMRC, which is responsible for the administration of the other statutory payments, acknowledges the risk of fraudulent claims but regards the risk and the consequences for taxpayers' funds as likely to be relatively limited. We will work to minimise the risk and the level of abuse in an appropriate and proportionate way. As with other statutory payments,  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_735"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 735</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as statutory maternity pay, HMRC will conduct compliance checks with sanctions in the form of financial penalties for those employers or employees who abuse the system, details of which will be set out in guidance to be developed in 2010. If employers have suspicions about the validity of a claim-a point which I think the noble Lord was concerned about-they can refuse to pay and must then explain their reason to the employee in writing; the employee can then refer the matter to HMRC.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="10031839000010"></a>The question of the impact of the changes in Europe was also raised. There are two measures currently subject to revision in Europe but they are of a different nature. The pregnant workers directive essentially concerns pregnant mothers and maternity leave; parental leave is a separate entitlement. Political agreement was reached on the revised parental leave directive at the end of 2009. The revised directive extends the minimum amount of parental leave from three months to four. These directives are different from this measure which gives new fathers a right to additional paternity leave; accordingly additional paternity leave will give parents further choice.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="10031839000011"></a>The noble Lord was also concerned about what he described as a welter of legislation coming down the tracks in 2011. We wanted to give employers a longer lead-in period so that they could understand and prepare for the introduction of additional parental leave and pay. We were criticised from other quarters for doing that, but we believed that it was right.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="10031839000012"></a>We believe that implementation in April 2011 provides a suitable period for businesses to prepare effectively for the changes. To further support businesses, guidance will be developed by October this year which will provide employers with clear instructions-I emphasise "clear" in the light of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Cotter. I hope that by then we will have removed any ambiguities regarding their responsibilities.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="10031839000013"></a>The next phase of better regulation will address a range of issues affecting businesses in relation to employing people, including obligations within employment law in general. We recognise the problem; the Government are committed to reducing administrative and policy burdens on business. We have the same motivation-we want businesses to grow more jobs.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="10031839000014"></a>On the expectations of employers in verifying claims, all employees who have self-certified that they are entitled to additional paternity leave will be considered to have met the conditions. No further checks are required; however, employers may if they wish request a copy of the child's birth certificate or adoption notification and details of the mother's employer or a doctor to support that claim. If that information is requested, it must be provided in order for the claim to be valid.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="10031839000015"></a>If, after her return to work, a mother stops work again and resumes her entitlement to maternity pay, a father's entitlement to leave and pay is not brought to an end. Equally, where a mother leaves her employment and starts working for another employer, the father's entitlement to additional paternity leave continues. As to whether two fathers-for example, a natural father and a stepfather-can be eligible for additional paternity  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_736"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 736</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leave at the same time, more than one person taking additional paternity leave in respect of the same child goes against the policy intention of preventing more than one person being out of the labour market at any one time. Therefore, we have made it clear in the regulations that the mother can allow only one person to take additional paternity leave as a result of her ceasing to receive maternity payment. This will be reiterated in related guidance.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="10031839000016"></a>We are developing plans to publicise additional paternity leave as part of a wider work and families communication strategy. This will involve a targeted set of activities aimed at improving awareness of help for fathers as well as mothers to balance work and family responsibilities. These activities will include putting in place improved guidance for families and employers on the businesslink and directgov websites and refreshing the pregnancy and work leaflet in the Bounty packs provided to all expectant mothers to include more details of rights for new fathers. HMRC will also be introducing, updating and disseminating guidance for employers through its usual channels. Again, we need to make sure that that is free of ambiguity.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="10031839000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cotter, made an interesting point about changing attitudes, pointing out that fathers who are not yet engaged will do so. That is absolutely right; we have seen significant changes in attitude among fathers, which is to be welcomed. We agree with the analysis that this is another step that will encourage the process, with all the positive benefits that will flow from that. Parenting will be seen as something to be shared by both parents and not just the responsibility of the mother.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="10031839000018"></a>The direction of travel is right; we could wish that it was slightly faster, but it will give employers a chance to get used to the process. I was pleased with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, about a small business employing somebody who goes on maternity leave; there is a recognition that this is a skilled person whom the business has invested in, and that the individual has invested their livelihood. We want to get these people back. That is a really positive attitude and let us hope that, over a period of time, paternity leave will be seen in the same positive light as assisting another skilled worker whom we want to encourage to return to work.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="10031839000019"></a>Approaches to childcare have changed over time. Primary care, as I have said, is no longer seen to be largely the woman's responsibility. Fathers play an increasingly significant role, with 93 per cent taking time off around birth-maybe not a long period of time but they are engaging. Evidence published by the National Equality Panel shows that 44 per cent of women now earn as much or more than their partners, which is an interesting statistic. Early involvement by fathers in the upbringing of their children leads to a number of positive outcomes, and continued involvement throughout the child's life leads to the reduced likelihood of the child's involvement in criminal activity and increased educational attainment.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para28"></a>

It is clearly meant to be "or" and not "and". We will scrutinise that and if there is any error we will make sure that it is corrected. I have endeavoured to answer all the questions raised. If I have not covered everything, I will write to noble Lords. In closing, I thank all those who participated in today's debate-a small but quality group. The introduction of additional paternity leave and pay will create flexibility in childcare arrangements that will allow fathers to spend more time with their babies. It is right that we give careful consideration to these issues which are so important to family life. I commend these regulations to the House.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_738"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 738</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Before discussing the amendments, it may be helpful to first provide some background on the history and purpose of ContactPoint. The purpose of ContactPoint is simple. It is to allow practitioners to quickly find out who else is working with a child. This tool will facilitate better information-sharing between practitioners. From a number of serious case reviews, we know that this needs to be improved.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="10031839000022"></a>However, ContactPoint is not just about safeguarding. Many children, perhaps as many as 50 per cent, will at some point need additional help and support. Practitioners have told us that one barrier to quickly providing this support is that it can be difficult and time-consuming to find the right person to talk to. In a survey of over 6,000 practitioners which my department conducted last year, we found that more than three-fifths of practitioners said that information about other practitioners involved with a child is not usually readily available. More than one-fifth of practitioners said that they never find this information despite their best efforts, and two-thirds of practitioners said that it is not easy to find information about whether a child is registered with a universal service, such as a school or GP. We have developed ContactPoint to overcome barriers such as these. ContactPoint gives practitioners quick access to the contacts they need so that they can work together to support children.</p>

<a name="100318-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="10031839000023"></a>We cannot know or readily predict which children will need additional services. Because of this, ContactPoint holds records for all children in England, but these records contain only very limited information. A ContactPoint record holds basic identifying information for the child or young person and contact details for the services working with them. The primary legislation for ContactPoint excludes the directory from holding case information, such as health records.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100318-0012.htm"/>


<a name="100318-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="10031839000024"></a>National implementation of ContactPoint is now under way. This follows a successful early adopter phase: over 75 per cent of practitioners surveyed said that they would find ContactPoint useful in their work with children. Local authorities and national partners across England are now training practitioners to use the directory. Likely user numbers are estimated to be around 390,000, although the number and speed at which users are trained will be jointly determined with local authorities and national partners. This will be based on what is necessary to best ensure that ContactPoint is effective. Access to ContactPoint is granted only to those who need to use it for their jobs. All users must complete mandatory training, identity checks, and an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau disclosure which is reviewed every three years.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="10031839000025"></a>Once implementation is complete, we estimate that ContactPoint will save 5 million hours of practitioners' time each year, equivalent to efficiency savings of £88 million per year. Practitioners using the system are already seeing real evidence of its benefits. For example, a staff nurse in an A&amp;E department told us:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="10031839000066"></a>"I'm spending far less time finding other practitioners working with the same child. ContactPoint is helping to make everything smoother, quicker and more efficient".</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="10031839000026"></a>Throughout the development and implementation of ContactPoint, we have been committed to learning from users and other stakeholders. For example, we  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_739"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 739</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have consulted with over 1,000 children and young people since 2005, when we announced the intention to develop the directory. These amendments are based on what we have learnt since we began developing ContactPoint, and particularly on the advice of expert stakeholders. There was also a formal public consultation on the three most substantive amendments, which I will discuss in detail in a moment.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="10031839000027"></a>These amendments do not alter the fundamental principles or design of ContactPoint. These modest changes will further align the operation of ContactPoint with its policy intentions, helping practitioners to make the contacts they need, to improve children's well-being and keep them safe.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="10031839000028"></a>One amendment, perhaps the most substantial, is necessary to address a recommendation in Sir Roger Singleton's review of safeguarding arrangements in schools. Sir Roger recommended that DCSF take steps to ensure that pupils who receive education in schools in England, but who are not ordinarily resident in England, are covered by ContactPoint.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="10031839000029"></a>The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families accepted all of the Singleton recommendations in a Written Ministerial Statement on 24 March 2009. As the Singleton recommendation highlights, because currently children must be "ordinarily resident" in England to be included on ContactPoint, this means that some important groups of children in England are excluded. Aside from exceptional circumstances, a child is deemed to have the same ordinary residence as their parents. So, for example, as the regulations currently stand, children at boarding school in England, but whose parents live abroad, may be excluded from ContactPoint.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="10031839000030"></a>To address the Singleton recommendation, we are proposing to change the regulations so that any child,</p>
<ul><a name="10031839000067"></a>"in the area of a local authority",</ul>
<p><a name="10031839000061"></a>in England should have a ContactPoint record. This means that all children who live in England, or who attend school in England, should be included on ContactPoint, regardless of their place of ordinary residence. Under the enabling provisions for ContactPoint in the Children Act 2004, and also under other legislation, local authorities and their partners have duties towards children who are,</p>
<ul><a name="10031839000068"></a>"in the area of the local authority".</ul>
<p><a name="10031839000062"></a>ContactPoint can help them meet these duties. The fact of where a child's parents live should not exclude that child from ContactPoint, as the directory is a vital tool to help safeguard and improve the well-being of children in England.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="10031839000031"></a>Another amendment ensures that ContactPoint can hold the contact details of parents who do not have parental responsibility or care of their child. It is important that these details are included on ContactPoint because parents without parental responsibility may still be in regular contact with their child, and be closely involved in their child's life. They can also have a range of legal rights and responsibilities in relation to their child. So, in some circumstances it may be appropriate for practitioners to consult with them on decisions regarding their child. Including these parents' details on ContactPoint will help practitioners to do this.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="10031839000032"></a>The other six amendments are more minor, reflecting further technical changes necessary to ensure that ContactPoint can operate in line with its policy intentions, and to reflect the advice of expert stakeholders. For example, the amendments will change the terminology used to describe the non-universal services that are recorded on ContactPoint, from "specialist and targeted" to "additional" services. Stakeholders have told us that this is more widely used and less stigmatising.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="10031839000033"></a>We have carefully considered the responses to the public consultation on the amendments. In light of this, and the generally positive responses, we have decided to proceed with the amendments that were proposed in the consultation document. While these amendments are quite minor changes, and do not fundamentally alter ContactPoint, together they mean that ContactPoint will be an improved tool for practitioners, helping to provide integrated support as soon as a child needs it. I commend these regulations to the House.</p>

As she said, they deal with the ContactPoint database, and who has access to it. ContactPoint was developed, among other things, as a response to the failure of authorities in north London to work together to protect Victoria Climbié, who was tragically murdered by relatives a decade ago.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="10031839000035"></a>However, it has been dogged by safety problems and technical difficulties, as the Minister acknowledged. While acknowledging that this is far from an easy matter to deal with, we on these Benches are very concerned that the risks to security posed by ContactPoint have not yet been adequately addressed. Therefore, I wish to ask the Minister the following brief questions. First, if the database is secure, why will the Government not publish the full Deloitte report into ContactPoint security? Secondly, what guarantees can she give to preserve the identity and security of children who are adopted? Thirdly, if, as the Explanatory Notes indicate, the response from piloting authorities has been "overwhelmingly positive", how is that reconciled with the fact that there have been five reported security breaches when we are only at the pilot stage? Fourthly, and lastly, will she inform the House what other feedback-especially negative feedback-the Government have received from pilot authorities?</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="10031839000037"></a>We on these Benches have also expressed concern at the amount and the nature of information about children that is kept on databases, the levels of security of this information and who would be authorised to have access to it. Like the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, we have sought assurances about possible breaches of security by unauthorised people or organisations. However, there is a balance to be struck. We recognise the value in what the Minister set out of using technology so that authorised practitioners in different services can share information on a child so  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_741"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 741</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they can work together and build up a holistic view of a child's welfare. These regulations do not challenge the principles and design of ContactPoint but tidy up some anomalies and make amendments in the light of experience.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="10031839000038"></a>First, the Minister mentioned the consultation that DCSF undertook last year. We note that 47 responses were received. This seems a low number on which to base some pretty significant changes. Will the Minister comment on this level of response and say whether the Government are satisfied that it is a sufficient response on which to base the amendments? Secondly, the Explanatory Memorandum gives assurances that the department will regularly survey users of ContactPoint to measure benefits delivery. What form are these surveys likely to take and how frequently are they likely to take place? Will they also monitor the costs of the database?</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="10031839000039"></a>Thirdly, Regulation 5 headed "Accessible child record" will allow the Secretary of State to determine when an individual child's record should be shielded. This is a power that currently resides with local authorities. The additional power for the Secretary of State is apparently to be used in a small number of cases for,</p>
<ul><a name="10031839000069"></a>"reasons of witness or victim protection".</ul>
<p><a name="10031839000063"></a>Will the Minister clarify what safeguards are in place to ensure that the Secretary of State uses these powers very selectively, and who else in the department is likely to have access to the database on those occasions? What checks and balances are in place to ensure that an overly eager Secretary of State does not intervene excessively? I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="10031839000040"></a><b><a name="100318-0012.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10031839000085"></a>The Earl of Erroll:</b> My Lords, I rise briefly to put a couple of questions to the Minister. For some time, many in the IT security community have been worried about the scope and scale of this database. I notice that when this provision was passed, it was said that there were to be 360,000 who would have access to the database, but that figure has now gone up to 390,000. Is it anticipated that this figure will rise dramatically in the future because it has not been running very long and there has been quite a large increase already?</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="10031839000041"></a>I am intrigued by the statement that some 5 million hours of time will be saved every year. That may well be true, but it will be counterbalanced by the amount of time required to keep the database up to date, which must be quite significant. Will there be a real and considerable net saving or will practitioners in this area of care actually have to spend even more time making that the data are accurate? That is relevant because only yesterday I was informed that there is an inaccuracy rate of around 2 per cent in the DVLA database which has led to some inappropriate decisions, prosecutions and so on. Presumably as this database matures, it is going to become more difficult to keep it up to date. Are people anticipating any problems in this area?</p>

As I hope my opening remarks made clear, ContactPoint is a significant part of the contribution that the Government are making towards promoting the interests of children in terms of identifying those potentially in need of  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_742"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>additional services and playing a key role as a tool in our safeguarding strategy. This is an important database and it is therefore important that we should consider the regulations today.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="10031839000043"></a>I shall try to respond in detail to the questions that have been put to me. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, made some important points about security. Even though only a minimal amount of data are kept on ContactPoint, security of information is absolutely paramount and something that we take very seriously. It is only right and proper that noble Lords should want to know more about that aspect.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="10031839000044"></a>The noble Lord asked particularly why the Deloitte report will not be published. The background is that, on 20 November 2007, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided, as the noble Lord knows, to commission an independent review of ContactPoint's security procedures. This was announced in a Written Statement to Parliament on 27 November. The review was undertaken by Deloitte, which reported to Ministers in early February 2008. On 21 February 2008, the executive summary of the report was published, which included Deloitte's recommendations. The Government's response to those recommendations was also published on the same day.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="10031839000045"></a>The Deloitte review confirmed that robust measures are in place for the security of ContactPoint and acknowledged that the importance of security is ingrained in the project. The review did not find any areas of significant weakness-that is a key point to stress. ContactPoint has undergone numerous levels of testing and review since the Deloitte review, involving all the kinds of testing that those interested in data management and security would expect. ContactPoint is government-accredited for security and is compliant with the international standard for information security management, ISO/IEC 27001.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="10031839000046"></a>I was asked about the publication of the full report. The report contains sensitive information about the security of ContactPoint. It is important to state that publication would do the opposite of what noble Lords have asked for. I will maintain that line, as noble Lords would expect. Publication would compromise the security of the data by providing a rich amount of information on how the security of the system works. We believe that we have done absolutely the right thing by putting as much information on the Deloitte report into the public domain as we can.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="10031839000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked about security incidents. There have been a small number of incidents in which the correct procedures for the use of ContactPoint were not followed. I have been absolutely clear that there are very tight and correct procedures that need to be followed. The incidents were all investigated and appropriate action was taken. There is no evidence that any of these incidents indicated malicious intent or led to data in ContactPoint being at any risk. The fact that such incidents have been quickly identified and addressed demonstrates that the stringent security processes in place are working. I hope that I can offer the noble Lord the reassurance for which he is looking.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="10031839000048"></a>The noble Lord also asked about shielding and adoption. We have considered carefully whether all adopted children should be shielded. Delivery of  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_743"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 743</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ContactPoint should not in any way put children at increased risk. That is why we have the functionality to shield the records of any children who would be at increased risk of harm if their whereabouts became known. That would apply to children whether they are adopted or not. Each adoption is of course an individual case, and assessment of whether to shield a child's records needs to be carried out on a case-by-case basis. Guidance has been provided to local authorities setting out the circumstances in which shielding would be appropriate. Comprehensive and stringent security arrangements are in place to prevent inappropriate access to information. Shielding is an additional measure relevant to the minority of children who are already considered to be at an increased risk should their whereabouts become known.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="10031839000049"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked about feedback from the pilots. When we are talking about pilots, we are actually referring to early adopters. We have published a report that brings together all their experiences; it might be helpful if I send that to noble Lords, because there is an awful lot in it. There has been a lot of positive feedback about the usability of the system and how it helps people to do their jobs. I should be happy to send that report to noble Lords and to put a copy in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="10031839000050"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Garden, asked about the number of responses to the consultation. Occasionally when the Government consult, the number of responses is quite small. That does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest; sometimes it means that people feel comfortable with the proposals. We have developed ContactPoint by working closely with early adopters in local authorities, making sure that we work with the whole local authority community and with the voluntary sector. We have a close dialogue with the users of ContactPoint at every stage and receive a lot of feedback. I am confident that the consultation that we have undertaken has given us some very helpful feedback, which enables us now to go ahead with the amendments to the regulations.</p>

This picks up on the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, about how we evaluate the benefits of ContactPoint. It is important that we keep a close eye on what is happening as we evaluate ContactPoint usage. We plan a survey of practitioners in the summer of 2010. We published a baseline survey in 2009, which we can circulate to noble Lords. It covers the usage of the service, how people are finding it and whether it is saving the time that we expected. I will happily keep noble Lords informed about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="10031839000052"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Garden, asked about shielding and the power proposed for the Secretary of State to decide to exclude or shield records. As noble Lords know, shielding hides the contact details of the child or young person and their parent or carer, together with those of any practitioners involved with them. A shield is applied only where it is appropriate to do so and according to the criteria-this is the important point-in the ContactPoint guidance.</p>

That will enable the process to be managed centrally in the most appropriate and secure manner. There are a very small number of these cases. In other cases, as the noble Baroness is aware, the decision to shield a record will continue to be the responsibility of the relevant local authority. The revised statutory ContactPoint guidance will clarify this.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="10031839000054"></a>I reassure the noble Baroness that in DCSF only a small central management team, whose members have been through all the checks that you would expect-the ones that I have described-will be involved in using ContactPoint. Team members are cleared and trained in the same way as any other ContactPoint user. Shielding is a very rare occurrence and the Secretary of State must follow the same criteria as local authorities have done since the early adopters were rolled out.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="10031839000055"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, asked about the number of ContactPoint users and the accuracy of the data. To be clear about the numbers, the national rollout of ContactPoint began in October 2009 and more than 5,000 authorised practitioners have now been trained and are using ContactPoint. Even at this early stage, we have promising evidence of the ways in which it is helping practitioners in their day-to-day work with children. The report to which I referred is a very good example. The speed at which practitioner use builds up over time will be agreed jointly by local authorities and national partners in the light of local needs. Access to ContactPoint is strictly limited to those who need it as part of their work, so there must be a specific reason for practitioners to want to use it. All users must have completed their identity checks and enhanced Criminal Records Bureau disclosure, which is renewable, as we know.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="10031839000056"></a>The likely user numbers are estimated to be about 390,000, but we have tried to be clear that the ultimate number of users will be determined by local authorities when they deem what is the most reasonable use and what most improves their day-to-day practice. These decisions will be governed by regulations and guidance, by the criteria that we have talked about, but ultimately by capacity and resources in the local authorities. I am not expecting that the number will be revised either way, but in practice we will be monitoring carefully the usage and the benefits that we can identify from that usage.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="10031839000057"></a>On the accuracy of data, obviously wherever possible ContactPoint will be automatically updated from existing systems. That is a key point. Practitioners will not need to enter the same information twice. That is done through the national data feeds. Data will be updated for other purposes anyway-for example, when a child moves school. We have had feedback from parents of children with disabilities, who have had to tell their story several times and give contact details of different therapists who work with their child. That kind of repetition of data will be much less problematic for parents and much more straightforward.</p>

<a name="100318-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="10031839000058"></a>To be clear again, the department recognises the importance of data quality to the effectiveness of ContactPoint, which is one of the points that I think the noble Earl was driving at. We have made a significant  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_745"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column 745</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>investment in supporting local authorities in discharging their responsibilities and making sure that they have good teams locally that know their job very well to ensure that the quality of data is properly looked after. Specifically, that includes training of ContactPoint data administrators in every local authority and the ongoing provision of ContactPoint data administration tools and guidance from DCSF. All data fed to ContactPoint undergo an accreditation process to ensure that they are submitted in the best possible form and are of the highest quality. Transmission must be secure and reliable.</p>

The amendments are modest and do not change the fundamental principles or the design of ContactPoint. They are necessary, though, to ensure that ContactPoint can operate in line with the policy intentions in the primary legislation, helping practitioners to work together to keep children safe and to improve their well-being. The amendment will legally enshrine good practice and improve the operation of ContactPoint in line with what practitioners and expert stakeholders have advised. I commend the regulations to the House.</p>

The Building Societies (Insolvency and Special Administration) (Amendment) Order 2010 makes technical changes to the building society insolvency procedure and the building society special administration procedure.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000004"></a>The building society sector has weathered the financial crisis relatively well in the light of the especially harsh business environment of the past few years. During that time, however, there has been consolidation in the sector and one failure-the Dunfermline Building Society. The sector continues to provide valued services to members and customers throughout the United Kingdom, and the Government remain committed to supporting the financial mutuals sector as a viable alternative to banks and an important way of ensuring a more competitive financial services sector.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000005"></a>I turn, first, to the Building Societies (Financial Assistance) Order 2010. While the sector has generally held up well, the financial crisis brought about the need for liquidity assistance for financial institutions of all kinds. Liquidity support such as provided by the Bank of England under the special liquidity scheme was only one example of the type of schemes in place across Europe and elsewhere. Improving building  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC282"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>societies' ability to access emergency funding from central banks strengthens the resilience of an institution against potential failure and, in so doing, protects the interests of building society customers, who are also their members.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000006"></a>In most respects, the order replicates the provisions of the Building Societies (Financial Assistance) Order 2008, which was made under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008. In particular, it modifies the application of Section 7 of the Building Societies Act 1986 to ensure that relevant financial assistance from a qualifying institution is not taken into account for the purposes of the 50 per cent limit on building societies' non-member funding. It also disapplies Section 9B of the 1986 Act, which restricts the creation of floating charges, and applies insolvency law provisions on administrative receivers to make it possible for a qualifying institution to appoint an administrative receiver under a floating charge.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000007"></a>However, the order makes wider provision than the existing order. Whereas the 2008 order applied only to financial assistance offered or provided by the Bank of England, this order will apply in respect of financial assistance offered or provided by the Treasury, the Bank of England, another central bank of a member state of the European economic area or the European Central Bank. It therefore widens the sources from which financial assistance can be granted.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000008"></a>In addition, whereas the 2008 order applied only where the financial assistance is provided,</p>
<ul><a name="10031840000100"></a>"for the purposes of maintaining the stability of the financial system in the United Kingdom",</ul>
<p><a name="10031840000088"></a>this order will apply where financial assistance is provided for any purpose, even where there is no wider threat to financial stability.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000009"></a>Prior to laying the order, the Treasury consulted in July 2009 on a wider order that would, first, modify building society law to make it easier for building societies to receive financial assistance from a central bank; and, secondly, allow building societies to grant floating charges in favour of payment and settlement systems to help them take advantage of such financial assistance. The consultation closed on 31 October 2009. Respondents to it expressed the view that both the provisions would be useful for accessing financial assistance. However, in light of further consideration, I have decided that it is appropriate to make an order that is a little more limited in scope. The wider order would have enabled building societies to grant floating charges for reasons unconnected with financial assistance. It would have given a general and indefinite permission to building societies to grant floating charges so that they could access settlement and payment and settlement systems directly. To do that would increase risk in the sector, and goes beyond the intention of the policy. The order therefore puts in place only the first of the two provisions, which will make it easier for financial assistance to be granted to building societies from a wider range of sources.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000010"></a>I make it clear that the proposals in the order are purely precautionary. They are intended to place building societies on a similar footing to banks, not single them out for special treatment. Extending the financial assistance order to cover assistance from the Treasury, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank or another  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC283"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>central bank in the European economic area has been widely supported by stakeholders, including the building societies and their association. The Government believe that the order represents sensible and prudential contingency planning on the part of the authorities, improving the position of building societies and bringing them on to a similar footing as banks with regard to financial assistance.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000011"></a>I turn now to the Building Societies (Insolvency and Special Administration) (Amendment) Order 2010, which will make changes to the building society insolvency procedure and the building society special administration procedure. These were created on an urgent basis in March 2009 to enable the resolution of the Dunfermline Building Society. It was not possible at that point to undertake public consultation before making the necessary secondary legislation. The Government therefore committed to public consultation, and to bring forward an amending instrument if necessary.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000012"></a>The Government conducted a full public consultation from July to October 2009, and has received advice from the Banking Liaison Panel which has been published on the Treasury's website. Stakeholders supported the policy proposals, and the BLP has made three technical recommendations, which are set out in its published advice. In relation to building society insolvency, the BLP made two recommendations-that the FSCS should have certain conditional rights in the insolvency, and that building society members should retain rights to participate in the insolvency and to be informed about its progress. Those are matters for the statutory insolvency rules. The Government agree with the BLP's proposals, and they will be included in the rules when they are made in due course.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000013"></a>The BLP proposed that provision be made to ensure that the building society special administrator could change the name of the residual society after a partial transfer. Under the BSSAP as it stands, there are various routes by which the special administrator could pursue that goal, and he or she would ultimately have recourse to the courts. To put the administrator's ability to change the name of the residual society beyond legal doubt would require significant revisions to building society law. The Government do not believe that such wide-ranging change would be appropriate.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000014"></a>The order therefore limits itself to making essentially minor and technical amendments, some of which respond to the points made by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments when the original order was made.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000015"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10031840000122"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these orders and I shall not respond to his opening words, which were broadly that the mutual sector is doing rather well. In the face of several consolidations and one failure, it has not been a good time for the mutual financial sector. But that is a debate for another day. When we considered the 2009 insolvency and special administration order, which will be replaced by the order before us today, I had rather a lot to say. I think that the Minister may be relieved to know that I shall not be repeating that performance and we have no fundamental problems with either of the orders.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC284"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000016"></a>So far as the Building Societies (Insolvency and Special Administration) (Amendment) Order is concerned, it was good to see the advice of the sub-group of the Banking Liaison Panel in full on the Treasury's website and summarised fairly in the Explanatory Memorandum. The panel has been a good invention for all these highly complicated areas of law surrounding banks, building societies and financial transactions generally. It gives a lot of comfort to see that the draft order has been reviewed by the sub-group and I shall not pursue the relatively small points that remain from that review and from the consultation generally.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000017"></a>Turning to the Building Societies (Financial Assistance) Order, I can criticise the Treasury a little. The Treasury's website for the consultation on these orders shows the responses from the Building Societies Association and the Insolvency Service, although in each case they are wrongly referenced to each other. If you click on "Insolvency Service", you get the Building Societies Association and vice versa. I checked that again this morning and it is still the case.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000018"></a>The main response of the Building Societies Association says, at paragraph 30, that it has responded separately to the financial assistance consultation. But that is not on the Treasury's website. The noble Lord will be relieved to know that I found it on the website of the Building Societies Association. Luckily for the Minister, that did not raise any points that I wish to raise with him today.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000019"></a>I have one point for the Minister on the financial assistance order. He said that it is wider in its potential application because the Banking Act 2009 defined "financial assistance" in a broader way than the 2008 Act, in that it was not confined to financial stability. I think that that was because Section 228 of the 2009 Act was intended to be a very broad definition of financial assistance for other purposes in the Banking Act.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000020"></a>I understood what the Minister said as regards this wider definition not being used to apply to floating charges, but it remains and can be used for financial assistance to building societies. Will the Minister say what the practical impact of this wider definition is intended to be? Do the Government intend to use the power under this Act in a way that they would not have used it under the 2008 Act? It looks as if the Government have rather a wide power now to prop up all kinds of ailing building societies and, if I go back to my opening remarks, I have noticed that they ail from time to time. Therefore, it is a potential concern that such a power exists.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000021"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031840000123"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, we support these two orders. I am afraid that I have not had the assiduity of the noble Baroness in that I have not looked at the Treasury website, but I was pleased to see that consultation had taken place over a relatively relaxed period and that it had been taken very seriously.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000022"></a>There is just one area where I have a question and it relates to the extension of the financial assistance provision to cover another central bank of a member state of the European economic area or the European Central Bank. Can the Minister explain the circumstances in which the Government envisage that that provision  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC285"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC285</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>might be used? Secondly, can he say whether in this respect this order merely matches what is already on the statute book in respect of banks?</p>

<p><a name="10031840000023"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10031840000124"></a>Lord Myners:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for their contributions to this debate. I fear that I shall never quite achieve the high standards that the noble Baroness sets, but that does not sadden me because it is a continued encouragement. I know that I may not make the mark but I like to feel that occasionally I make some progress in closing the gap. I give her the benefit of the doubt; I do not think that she raises the bar whenever she thinks I am getting closer. However, I shall hurry back to the Treasury, fiddle with the technology and try to make sure that the website is correct. At the same time, I shall satisfy myself that this was not some cunning plan to outfox the noble Baroness by putting the wrong information in the wrong place, although I cannot think why anyone would want to do that to help the Minister. I greatly appreciate the support expressed by both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord for the matter before the Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000024"></a>Consolidation is an inevitable feature of financial markets. I think that it is happening globally in banking, in mutuals and in insurance. There is probably no developed market in the world in which a process of consolidation has not occurred, and of course that applies to building societies as much as anything else. I do not think that the continuing trend to merge building societies is in itself a sign of distress; in fact, in some cases it creates more critical mass, it shares resources and it reflects the fact that, in a very competitive retail market, organisations constantly have to press to improve their efficiency. However, I am delighted that there is still room for small building societies. A particular favourite of mine is the single branch Stafford Railway Building Society, which I cited this morning to the <I>Which?</I> Banking Commission as an exemplar of good governance and good, responsible behaviour. However, I think that that explains the consolidation. The problems of the Dunfermline Building Society were idiosyncratic and came back to my old hobby-horse of poor governance being a critical contributory factor.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000025"></a>Last year, the Government set up an expert group, commissioned to look at reforming financial markets. It has addressed various challenges facing the building society sector, and we will have rather more to say about that in the Budget next Wednesday. The Banking Liaison Panel will be greatly encouraged by the noble Baroness's comments about the success of this venture. The people who sit on that panel work hard and diligently in getting to grips with some quite technical issues. We all benefit from the quality of the work that it does.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000026"></a>The noble Baroness asked what the practical impact is of the wider definition of financial assistance. There may be a case where there is not a wider threat to financial stability but where it would still be appropriate to give assistance to an individual society. Such a decision would be made on a case-by-case basis but it is certainly not central to our planning here that we would be obliged to step in and support individual societies. Indeed, I have said that one of the  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC286"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tests of financial reform has to be to get to a position where financial institutions are allowed to fail without that doing damage to either retail depositors or the system. One of the lessons of the past few years is that we were not able to allow banking businesses to fail. As a result, the salutary consequences of failure were not always brought upon shareholders-subordinated to creditors-and the management of banks to the extent that a perfect model would have sought to achieve.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000027"></a>The noble Baroness asked why the range of qualifying institutions needed extending. Under the existing order, statutory barriers that might otherwise prevent building societies accessing financial assistance from the Bank of England are removed. However, as has been seen during the financial crisis, financial institutions may also receive financial assistance from other sources, such as central banks in other European countries or the European Central Bank. The Government are of the view that societies should wherever possible have the same ease of access to financial assistance as banks. By extending the definition of "qualifying institution" to include the Treasury, the ECB and other EEA central banks, the order better enables building societies to access the broader range of financial assistance that may be available to banks, particularly in the form of loans secured by a floating charge over their assets.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000028"></a>It was asked also why the order was necessary, as building societies are already able to get emergency liquidity assistance from the Bank. Does it mean that specific building societies are in trouble now, or are we anticipating something of that sort happening? I endeavoured in my opening comments to make it very clear that the order was not triggered by anything of the moment, but rather is prudent and anticipatory action that would contemplate increasing the range of options open to us should a building society experience difficulty in the future. The proposals in the order are therefore purely precautionary and the timing is routine.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000029"></a>While the existing order under the Banking (Special Provisions) Act is not subject to a sunset clause, it is desirable that this wider order be made so that the financial assistance can be provided by a range of qualifying institutions. The changes are intended to place building societies on a similar footing to banks, not to single them out for special treatment. At this stage, it is not possible to answer hypothetical questions about circumstances in which assistance might be provided by the ECB or another EEA central bank. I say simply that it is possible to envisage those circumstances, and it is wise and sensible to ensure that we do not find ourselves over a weekend-it is my experience that problems always seem to happen over a weekend; banks seem to manage to teeter through to a Friday before they experience real difficulty-suddenly realising that some restriction stops us reaching for an available and attractive source of liquidity and support.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000030"></a>I think that I have answered the questions raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. If that is the case, I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000031"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="10031840000127"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My Lords, the order before us today is to bring into operation a new code of practice under Section 21A of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. The code has been laid before each House in accordance with the statutory requirements. The code of practice will enable us to bring into force Section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. I can confirm that it is our intention to do so on the same day as the code enters into force; namely, 1 May.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000032"></a>Section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 adds a new Section 6C to the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act. This new section extends the existing requirement on the accused to disclose alibi witnesses before the trial in Crown Courts, and in some cases in magistrates' courts, to defence witnesses generally in all proceedings. The new section will primarily strengthen the court's case management powers and in so doing encourage the more effective progression of criminal proceedings. It will also enable the police to carry out criminal record checks at an earlier stage and so assist the prosecution to prepare more expeditiously any bad character applications that may be required before the trial.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000033"></a>The background to the code of practice lies in the parliamentary passage of the new witness disclosure requirement. Some concerns were expressed at the time by the Home Affairs Committee, and subsequently,  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the requirement might enable the police to apply undue pressure on defence witnesses. These concerns were to some extent overstated; the police will often be aware of the existence of a witness, merely as a natural consequence of their ordinary investigative procedures, and that has always been the case. Our position then and now is that it is important to allay any possible perception of a risk of police impropriety in relation to witnesses disclosed under the new provisions, and that is why we legislated for the present code of practice.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000034"></a>The code is essentially a safeguard. It sets out clearly the procedures expected of the police and other investigators in arranging any interviews with the disclosed witnesses, and in conducting them. We anticipate that in practice such interviews will be relatively rare. The code of practice has been the subject of extensive consultation. The primary legislation requires only consultation with four named authorities, but we conducted a full public consultation exercise in late 2004. As a result of that consultation, a number of points came to light requiring further consideration. We have recently reconsulted the four statutory consultees.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000035"></a>It is fair to say that the code has grown somewhat as a result of the consultation process. During the passage of the then Criminal Justice Bill, we supplied Parliament with an indicative version, which covered rather less than a page of text. The final version before us today goes into considerably more detail and is set out more formally. I trust that the Committee will take that as a sign of the seriousness with which we have approached the exercise.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000036"></a>On the detail of the code, the fundamental point we need to bear constantly in mind is that the whole process of being interviewed is entirely voluntary on the witness's part. The witness can decline to be interviewed at the outset and walk away from the interview at any stage. One could always suggest further areas in which the code might be more prescriptive but, given the voluntary nature of the process on the witness's part, there is a limit to the usefulness of including further detail. Our view is that the document now strikes the right balance in this respect.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000037"></a>The case for the new witness disclosure requirement, and hence the code, remains strong. The case of R v Warley Magistrates is symptomatic. In that case, a magistrates' court attempted to use the Criminal Procedure Rules to obtain advance disclosure of defence witness details very much along the lines that the statutory provision will require. The High Court determined that there was no power to do this under the Criminal Procedure Rules, but the court described Section 34 and its related provisions as,</p>
<ul><a name="10031840000101"></a>"matters of some importance in showing how a case management scheme requiring defence witness disclosure might properly and efficiently operate".</ul>
<p><a name="10031840000090"></a>We endorse those sentiments of approval. We agree with the court that Section 34 forms the basis for a sound witness disclosure scheme and remain convinced of its case management advantages.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000038"></a>This code of practice has been widely consulted on and carefully prepared. I commend it to the House.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC289"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC289</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were due to debate this afternoon on a separate Motion-the draft Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2010 and the draft Conditional Fee Agreements (Amendment) Order 2010. They will be debated in the House next Thursday rather than the Moses Room. That decision follows comments by the Merits Committee on those two statutory instruments, and representations from others including the noble Lord, Lord Martin of Springburn, who has tabled a Motion to Resolve that the House regrets that the Government have laid those instruments before it. No doubt we will debate that in due course. The reason I mentioned those instruments is that one of the noble Lord's principal concerns was that there had been a lack of consultation. On this order, therefore, I am grateful that the Minister emphasised that for once his department has had extensive consultation of the appropriate type.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000040"></a>On the code itself, as the Minister knows, my honourable friend Henry Bellingham in another place put a number of questions to the Government and received perfectly good answers, so I do not think it will be right to waste the time of the Committee this afternoon by asking anything further. I am grateful that the Minister emphasised the voluntary nature of the process and that it would apply only if the appropriate witness was prepared to come forward and be interviewed. It was right that he should emphasise that. We will not oppose the order.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000041"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10031840000129"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, when Section 34 was introduced into this House in the Criminal Justice Bill 2003, I expressed my reservations about it in these terms:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031840000096"></a>"It is difficult enough to give evidence anyway, but even more difficult to give evidence for the defence when a policeman appears at one's door, asking 'Are you really sure that that was what happened?' Sometimes their nerves fail; on other occasions police statements are obtained and used to cross-examine in minute detail".</p>

<p><a name="10031840000091"></a>I was referring to the experience with alibi notices. I said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031840000097"></a>"The disclosure of defence witnesses would give rise to the possibility of police pressure, which will do nothing for the administration of justice".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 16/6/03; cols. 570-71.]</p>

<p><a name="10031840000092"></a>Indeed, the administration of justice is my main concern.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000042"></a>In introducing the order, the Minister referred to case management and efficiency and that is all very well, but he will know from his own experience that very often issues arise during the trial quite out of the blue and it is necessary sometimes to call defence witnesses quite unexpectedly without going through all the giving of notices and so forth. I am concerned that this will cause injustice. I can see that in particular cases there could be a reference to the European court, ultimately, about whether this impinges on a fair trial.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000043"></a>Having said that, and having expressed my opposition to the principle, the code that has been produced after some seven years includes a lot of safeguards. I am interested about why it has taken seven years to produce. I think that indicates the sensitivity of the issue. In particular, I am very interested in the Explanatory Memorandum, which states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031840000098"></a>"It is intended to monitor closely the operation of the provisions in practice".</p>

<p><a name="10031840000093"></a>What has the Minister in mind by way of monitoring in future? How often will it take place and what sort of  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC290"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reports will be available to the profession and to the judiciary about how well the scheme operates? It is a very sensitive area, as I have said, and I can see that in certain circumstances there will be injustice. It is very important that the Government keep their eye on these provisions.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000044"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031840000130"></a>Lord Bach:</b> As always, I am grateful to the two noble Lords on the Opposition Front Benches for their contributions to this short debate. I am delighted that the consultation process has pleased the noble Lord, Lord Henley, on this occasion. He is right to stress its voluntary nature. It is fundamental to this order. It is not compulsory for a probable or possible defence witness to agree to be seen by the police. I acknowledge what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said. These are very sensitive areas, and they need to be looked at closely.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000045"></a>The alibi notice requirements have been in place for so long that I was practicing at the Bar when they first came in. The noble Lord will know better than me how successful they have been. I do not believe that there has been any proof that they have not been by and large successful, although it is always essential that safeguards are maintained. The code, which the noble Lord was kind enough to say contains quite a number of safeguards, is a more solid piece of work than the original code of conduct intended some years ago.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000046"></a>The noble Lord asked why the code has been delayed so long. It is regrettable. The delay has had much to do with competing pressures on resources and the need to settle the detail properly. Police interviews of defence witnesses, like defence interviews of prosecution witnesses, are a sensitive area, and considerable caution is required in regulating them. Following the Warley judgment, I understand that policy and the relevant parliamentary instruments were almost ready by the Summer Recess 2008. Unfortunately, as both noble Lords will remember, in June 2008 there was a major House of Lords judgment in the Davis case on witness anonymity and the ensuing emergency legislation intervened. These developments, the need to re-enact the emergency legislation and the new provisions on witness anonymity in last year's Coroners and Justice Act had the effect of pushing the code to one side again. It is regrettable, but the matters are now before the Committee.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000047"></a>As to the ECHR point, it is possible that any police pressure on witnesses could result in an Article 6 point being taken. However, Section 34 will not alter the position, and we hope that the code will protect police conduct regarding witnesses whose details are given. The usual PACE Section 78 considerations and other provisions are there to protect any defendant, and judges make sure that defendants have a fair trial.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000048"></a>The question on monitoring was perfectly proper and sensible. We are considering proposals from the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee relating to disclosure time limits in general. That includes defence statements. We will listen carefully to any concerns raised by the rule committee about the operation of the new provisions. We will be watching how this works closely.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000049"></a>Finally, I do not think that the noble Lord chides me, but he has pointed out that there are more important considerations than court management in the conduct  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC291"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of a criminal trial. Of course justice must remain the main consideration, but I think that all of us would agree that there is room for improvement in the way in which we manage our trials, particularly in the Crown Court.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000050"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10031840000131"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> Is it intended that the prosecution could in certain circumstances produce a notice of defence witnesses when those witnesses have not been called? As the noble Lord will know, the calling of witnesses by the defence is an extremely important issue. Very often, it depends entirely on the way in which a trial has gone as to whether a witness who may at one stage seem to be of help to the defence is seen to be no longer. It is very important to know whether a notice will be admissible.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000051"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10031840000132"></a>Lord Bach:</b> It is not a question that I can easily answer. My experience of defending, many years ago, was that sometimes it was a bit of a game as far as defence witnesses were concerned. Occasionally, you heard tales of defence witnesses being brought into court in the hope that their evidence would be over before the police had had the chance to check up on their previous convictions. It sometimes worked and sometimes it did not. To be honest, I think that most often it did not work. But the noble Lord has asked a good question. I may even have had references made in trials on the question of defence witnesses, but any judge would be extremely cautious in allowing in in the normal course of events any list that talked about potential defence witnesses. We will have to see how it works and this is one of the areas we will be monitoring.</p>

These statutory instruments are necessary in order to implement provisions that were the subject of debate during the passage of what became the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC292"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000053"></a>I shall begin with the disclosure of information for research purposes regulations, which are made under Section 33(D) of the 1990 Act, as amended by the 2008 Act. Before going on to discuss the regulations, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to two numbering errors in the printed regulations. In Regulation 4, paragraph (6) is numbered in error: paragraph (7) should be numbered (6), paragraph (8) should be numbered (7) and so on to the end of that regulation. The last sentence in Regulation 6 is numbered paragraph (2) in error. I apologise for these mistakes, which will be amended in the final version of the regulations.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000054"></a>The regulations provide for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority-the HFEA-to authorise the disclosure and use of certain identifying information contained in its register for medical or other research purposes. The regulations set out the process whereby research establishments make applications to the HFEA for authorisation and make provision for the revocation and suspension of authorisations by the HFEA when the research establishment has failed to protect the information disclosed to it. Finally, they make provision for the authority to be assisted by an oversight committee, which will help ensure the governance of the regime created by the regulations.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000055"></a>The register maintained by the HFEA records every IVF and donor insemination treatment cycle carried out in the UK since August 1991. It is one of the most comprehensive databases in the world and contains more than 800,000 entries. It has long been recognised that the register has the potential to be of significant use to researchers, enabling more extensive research on different treatments, their effectiveness and any long-term implications. This may include, for example, whether the ovarian stimulatory drugs taken during IVF treatment have any causal links to the development of ovarian cancer in some patients.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000056"></a>Since the 2008 Act came into force on 1 October 2009, patients and their partners can consent to disclosure and can vary or withdraw that consent at any time. This is good news for future researchers, but the real value of the HFEA register for current research is the wealth of data already on it. The 2008 Act therefore introduced a regulation-making power to allow identifying information to be released for research purposes, under certain conditions, without consent. The authorisation process for such a release is set out in the disclosure of information for research purposes regulations. Under the regulations, researchers applying to the HFEA to be given access to identifying information held on its register will need to demonstrate the project meets strict criteria, including that it is not reasonably practical to obtain the information other than under these regulations. The HFEA can refuse to grant authorisation, including when it is satisfied that the research project is not necessary or expedient in the interests of the public or improving patient care.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000057"></a>While parents can choose to give consent to disclosure of identifying information about children who have already been born, they cannot give prospective consent about a child that might never exist. This could compromise research relating to children born as a result of treatment services. The Government do not  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC293"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>want researchers and clinics to have to chase former patients to ascertain their wishes. We also do not want new parents to have to consider such matters when they have far more pressing concerns. We have therefore extended the authorisation process created by these regulations to apply to data about children recorded on the register at any time on or after 1 August 1991. The authorisation criteria will be exactly the same as for historic data.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000058"></a>The regulations do not apply to all the information held on the register. Information on the donation and use in treatment of donated gametes and embryos is excluded. This information is especially sensitive and it would be unacceptable to release it without the knowledge of those involved. The regulations were the subject of two public consultations, between January and March 2009 and between October and December. While I hope that people would be prepared to assist with important research, individuals are entitled to withhold their identifying information if they wish. The Government will work with the HFEA, patient groups and others to publicise the purpose and effect of the regulations.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000059"></a>I turn to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Parental Orders) (Consequential, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2010, which is made under Section 55 of the 2008 Act. The order is made by applying, with modifications, the adoption legalisation specified in the 2008 Act.</p>
<h5><a name="10031840000109"></a>3 pm</h5>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000060"></a>The first three schedules to the new parental orders order set out the detail of how the adoption legislation for England and Wales, for Scotland and for Northern Ireland has been applied to parental orders. Schedule 4 sets out the references to "adoption", "adoptive child" and "adoptive relationship" in the other legislation which are to be read as including reference to parental orders. In passing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, Parliament accepted that occasionally women are prepared to act as surrogates to help couples unable to have children of their own. Parental orders were introduced by the 1990 Act as a way of transferring parental responsibility from a surrogate and her partner, if she has one, to the intended parents referred to as the "commissioning couple".</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000061"></a>A parental order is made by the court. It requires agreement between the parties and is therefore based on their freely given and unconditional consent. Eligibility criteria were set out in the 1990 Act, which included the requirement that one or both of the commissioning couple must be the child's genetic parent. It also specified that the applicants must be a married couple. Since then, around 50 parental orders have been granted by the courts each year. Under current law, where same-sex and unmarried couples enter into a surrogacy arrangement, the only option for them to acquire parental responsibility for a child is adoption. However, the 2008 Act replaces the parental order provision in the 1990 Act to allow same-sex and unmarried couples to apply for parental orders as well as married couples.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000062"></a>As I have already outlined, the 2010 parental orders order applies current adoption legislation, with modifications, to parental orders. The order makes the

This emphasises the value of the child's interests and is in line with the approach in adoption cases. The welfare checklist set out in the Adoption and Children Act 2002 is also applied, with modifications, to parental orders. This is designed to support the courts in specifying the matters they should take into account when considering, for example, the particular needs of the child. The order was subject to a three-month public consultation in the autumn of 2009 and the responses received demonstrated broad agreement with the approach taken.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000063"></a>The consequential, transitional and saving provisions order revokes the 1994 parental order regulations but saves parts of those regulations for specific purposes. It makes the necessary consequential amendments to other legislation and sets out the transitional arrangements for applications made under the 1990 Act which are not disposed of when the new parental order provisions in the 2008 Act and the regulations come into force. Such applications will continue to be processed under the 1990 Act. I commend both sets of regulations and the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000064"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10031840000135"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations, which, as she said, cover issues that we debated during the passage of what is now the HFE Act 2008. There was a general agreement then that the particularly restrictive terms of the 1990 Act, which originally prohibited almost all disclosure of identifying information contained in the HFEA database, should be relaxed, subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, in order to facilitate research. For reasons which I shall explain, I am glad that this conclusion was reached and I welcome the fact that the Government have undertaken two consultation exercises on the issue since the passage of the Act. The regulations before us reflect the feedback from those consultations as far as is possible given that the opinions of consultees will inevitably differ.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000065"></a>The first issue that I want to raise was covered in the first consultation: consent. It is a generally accepted principle that, where identifying information is used for research purposes, the consent of the individuals involved should first be obtained. Respondents to the consultation were given three choices: to maintain current policy; to disclose data only with the consent of the person or persons to whom the information relates; or to establish a process to authorise disclosure where consent cannot be practicably obtained. The third of these options has been adopted in relation to those whose names were placed on the register up to 30 September 2009; in other words, the normal principle of explicit consent for the disclosure of identifying information has been retrospectively set aside. It would appear that it has been set aside for reasons of expediency-I think that we need to talk about that.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000066"></a>It is perfectly fair to argue that burdening IVF clinics with the task of contacting past patients, even if they were in a position to know their whereabouts, which they might not necessarily have been, would have been unreasonable. However, one idea which the department considered was a publicity campaign to encourage people with personal information on the  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC295"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>HFEA register to inform the authority if they were willing to allow identifying information to be released. That idea was rejected, I understand, on grounds of cost and uncertainty of outcome. I would question that. How expensive would such a campaign need to be? It is obvious that there would not be a 100 per cent response rate, but what response rate would be likely to provide a sufficient quantum of data to enable viable research to take place? Bearing in mind the sensitivity of the information in question, I cannot help feeling that this option, which after all is the most ethical, should not have been so swiftly rejected. Perhaps the Minister could comment.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000067"></a>I ask that question not least because of paragraph 52 of the impact assessment, which explains that, because some people may object to information being disclosed, the HFEA and patient groups will be asked to ensure that information on the regulations is circulated to stakeholders so that patients can register their objection. It also states that the Government will consider how best to raise public awareness of the regulations so that members of the public can be made aware of their right to withhold identifying information from disclosure. If this is what the Government are contemplating, what practical difference is there between such public awareness exercises and the publicity campaign discussed under option 2?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000068"></a>Following on from this is an important issue covered by Regulation 8(1)(c), which I shall quote. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031840000099"></a>"Where the Authority grants an authorisation, it must impose the conditions that ... the research establishment must not contact or request any other person to contact on the research establishment's behalf any individual who is identified by the disclosable protected information except in the manner and circumstances specified in the authorisation".</p>

<p><a name="10031840000094"></a>I cannot emphasise too strongly how important this provision is. We are dealing here with matters which of their very nature are intensely private. Where a child has been conceived by IVF, the parents may think it is nobody else's business to be aware of that fact. Indeed, it is by no means unimaginable that the parents will see no need to disclose it to the child and may not wish to do so. I personally know of a case where an IVF-conceived child was not told of the circumstances of her conception until she was well into adulthood. For any member of such a family to be contacted out of the blue by a research establishment with requests to supply information of an often confidential kind is not something that one can contemplate without very careful consideration of the manner in which the approach is made. What conditions will the HFEA put in place to ensure that these matters are handled with due sensitivity? The regulations specify that the disclosable protected information must be used only in accordance with the purposes set out in the authorisation. How will it be possible to police that? For how long may an authorisation be renewed at the end of its initial period of authorisation?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000069"></a>On the importance of long-term follow-up research into those born by assisted reproduction, recent meetings of the HFEA Scientific and Clinical Advances Advisory Committee-SCAAC-make sobering reading as regards the harm that may be caused to individuals conceived via IVF as a result of variations in the embryo culture  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC296"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>medium. A paper considered by the committee highlights some of the variable factors that could affect the future health of the child. In relation to embryo culture media, it notes that gene expression in the blastocyst is affected by culture conditions and warns that growth factors could block the action of the tumour suppressor gene p53. The medium known as Whitten's medium has been shown to affect the expression of 114 genes, while another medium called KSOM-AA affected the expression of 29 genes. Equally, serum may adversely affect mammalian pre-implantation embryos, causing alterations in metabolism and other abnormal effects. In general, it is stated that IVF increases the risk of genomic imprinting disorders.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000070"></a>In passing, it is astonishing to me that, despite clear indications that culture medium components might adversely affect the safety of children born after IVF, the SCAAC warns that there is no legal requirement to carry out clinical testing of the safety of embryo culture media, nor even any requirement for a manufacturer of an embryo culture medium to disclose the ingredients. There is more. The paper to which I referred warns that mouse embryo culture causes raised systolic blood pressure post-natally, and a Dutch study on children born after IVF found an effect on several cardiometabolic activities, with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and higher fasting glucose levels than in a control group of children. There is also concern over IVF procedures such as embryo biopsy, which is an essential part of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and the creation of saviour siblings. Recent research on mice born after embryo biopsy demonstrated a risk of neurodegenerative disorders and memory decline in adulthood, apparently due to alteration in gene expression of proteins in the brain associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including proteins associated with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. If the results are applicable to children born after embryo biopsy, the mental health in adulthood of saviour siblings and those born following pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is at risk.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000071"></a>What all this tells us is that we need to do research and, in doing it, we must look at a wider range of parameters than are normally examined in order to detect many of the types of disorder that could be caused, for example, by epigenetic abnormalities or alterations in gene expression. The follow-up research that has been conducted up to now has largely been based on short-term studies. Something of a longer term nature is needed if we are to understand the full medical and developmental implications of IVF procedures.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000072"></a>On the parental orders regulations, I wish to touch on only one issue-that is, the law relating to surrogacy. The Minister will recall from our debates on the HFE Bill two years ago that I drew attention to the differing treatment accorded to children born from surrogacy under English law compared to those born in other jurisdictions.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000073"></a>Under English law, the child is considered to be the offspring of the woman who carries and gives birth to him, and only a parental order or adoption order can change that. In other jurisdictions, such as Canada and California, surrogacy contracts have legal effect, by virtue of which the egg donor and carrying mother  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC297"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and her husband relinquish all rights to the child and the child is registered as the child of the commissioning parents. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other. They mean that if a child is conceived and born abroad as a result of a surrogacy arrangement, registered as the child of the commissioning parents in that jurisdiction and subsequently brought into this country, that child will in effect be parentless and stateless. In the state of origin, he is the child of the commissioning parents, while in our law he is the child of the carrying mother and her husband.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000074"></a>During the passage of the 2008 Act, the Government undertook to conduct a review of the law in this whole area, and I should like to ask the Minister how far this review has got and when it is likely to be completed. Until it is, we cannot be fully sure that the provisions of the 2008 Act are fully human-rights compliant.</p>

<p><a name="10031840000075"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="10031840000136"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, for the customarily thorough way in which she introduced these two sets of regulations. Before I turn to the detail, I should like to thank the staff from the department for their extremely helpful explanations. When presented with both sets of regulations at the same time, it was rather difficult to see one's way clearly through them. As in many aspects of the law in this field, many of the principles with which we are dealing are long established. However, it is the implementation of those principles in a very technical way that makes these statutory instruments appear to be much more complex than they are in many cases.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000076"></a>I shall start with the regulations which apply to disclosure of information for research. The noble Baroness is right that in our very detailed passionate and heated debates on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, or Bill as it then was, there was agreement that, on balance, it would be to the betterment of humanity if there were potential to conduct research using the database held by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. It was also agreed, without dissent, that information relating to donors and donor-conceived children was of a different order and had to be subject to much more stringent protection. Nevertheless, it was agreed that principally for the purpose of longitudinal research into the effects of embryology and the development of certain conditions, it would be preferable to let researchers have very limited access.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000077"></a>My recollections from the passage of the Act relate to the data held on the register. My understanding is that the register is a register of treatment; it is not a complete register of births that have resulted from treatment. I remember that when we talked at considerable length about issues relating to birth certificates and the rights of donor-conceived people to find out who their biological parents are, the briefings that we received from the HFEA pointed out that, because of the limited nature of the register, it is not possible to say that there is a complete register of all donors. For example, donors may have moved and the HFEA does not track the lives of donors after the point at which their information has been stored. It is therefore important to establish what we are talking about at the base level.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC298"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000078"></a>That plays directly into the point that was made about consent by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. We are now talking about information that goes back over a very long time, to 1991. I agree with the noble Earl about a campaign to raise awareness about the change to the use of the register for research into possible medical conditions. We should not assume that people who have been involved in IVF treatment or donation would automatically wish to be part of that, but they might if they knew about it. I, too, wanted to ask why the department had ruled out the mounting of a campaign.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000079"></a>Following on from that, I also wanted to ask about periods of authorisation for research. From Regulation 10, I understand that such authorisation would be for a period of five years. I am not the noble Lord, Lord Winston, but is it not the case that research programmes in this field can be quite lengthy and take a considerable amount of time? Therefore, can periods of authorisation be renewed and is there any limit on that renewal?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000080"></a>I also wanted to talk about the destruction of information. The regulations are, in many ways, rightly prescriptive about what research institutions must do and cannot do with information. They are very prescriptive about the penalties for mishandling information. In Regulation 18, which deals with the destruction of information, I see that there is no penalty for the failure to destroy information. The HFEA might therefore be powerless in such circumstances and that might be an omission.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000081"></a>Finally, I note in Regulation 21 the proposal to create an oversight committee. In an area as technical and sensitive as this that is probably a good thing. I see from the first three paragraphs of that regulation that the role of the oversight committee will be principally about the monitoring and granting of authorisations, the processing of disclosable information and looking at the annual reports of research establishments. Then there is a catch-all paragraph, to,</p>
<ul><a name="10031840000102"></a>"consider such other matters relating to these Regulations as the Authority or the Committee may determine".</ul>
<p><a name="10031840000095"></a>Can the Minister indicate the sort of things that that paragraph would be intended to cover and the sorts of things that it would not?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000082"></a>I happen to believe that the HFEA does a difficult job extremely well, but the organisation is frequently subjected to criticism, not all of it fair or informed. Part of the protection that we as Parliament owe the HFEA is to be quite clear about what its remit is and is not.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000083"></a>I welcome the parental orders regulations. As I was reading them, I was thinking about the discussions that the House had not only on the HFE Bill but going back to the Adoption and Children Act 2002. We discussed the importance of parental orders for families in which there is a clear and settled intent to create a family and for whom it is in the best interests of children to have a process that is swifter and lighter-touch than the full adoption process which involves going through a court. We should welcome that. I note that most of the order simply replicates parts of the law on adoption that have already been agreed by both Houses of Parliament and, therefore, should not detain us long.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC299"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000084"></a>However, I have two questions for the Minister. In cases of civil partnerships or long-term, but unmarried, heterosexual couples, I presume that these orders will come into force only when they are enacted and therefore apply to children who receive a parental order after the passage of these regulations. Is it therefore right to assume that families who are in this position at the moment would have had to go through a process under the Adoption and Children Act? I ask that to go to the question asked by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I assume that if families in this country have had children under surrogacy arrangements with surrogates abroad-anywhere, not just America-they would have had to go through an inter-country adoption process and, therefore, the children would be adopted, perhaps though a fast-track route. Can the Minister confirm that I am right and there is not a group of children in limbo waiting for the passage of these orders?</p>

<p><a name="10031840000085"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10031840000137"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I rise to speak from the Back Benches to press on two points that have already been extremely well covered from the Front Bench by my noble friend Lord Howe. They relate to the options available to the Department of Health. I know that my concerns are shared by the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, who cannot be here this afternoon as he is entertaining an important overseas delegation to Parliament.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000086"></a>Given the important shift that is taking place, we all recognise that research into the long-term effects on people born using assisted reproduction techniques is vital. There is growing evidence that there are long-term risks associated with various assisted reproduction procedures; for example, changes in embryo culture can have a remarkable impact on later development. It is therefore vital that information is collected, but it needs to be obtained in an ethical way. I am sure that the Government are concerned about this. The regulations have various safeguards. For example, if someone has expressed a wish not to have information disclosed for research, that wish will not be overridden. However, information could still, in certain circumstances, be disclosed without the person's knowledge or active consent. Will the Minister give a little more information about the circumstances in which that important disclosure of information might occur?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031840000087"></a>In relation to the options available, I again echo the comments that have already been made. In respect of option two, which has the advantage of not compromising the issue of consent, but which the department rejected on the basis of cost, could the Minister say what cost-benefit analysis was undertaken by the department to arrive at that conclusion? What assumptions were made to feed into that system?</p>
<h5><a name="10031842000067"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000001"></a>I also endorse the need for an advertising campaign to make people aware of the changes. This is one reason why the Government-any Government-should be extremely careful before introducing any retrospective changes, particularly in such a sensitive area. Could there not be a more adequate public information campaign? Given that, by and large, people who have had this experience would be attentive to media messages and to conversations-members of their families would  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC300"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be aware-such a campaign could be highly effective, although obviously not 100 per cent effective. If the Minister could explain the decision not to proceed with a campaign, it would be extremely helpful.</p>

<p><a name="10031842000002"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031842000077"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> My Lords, we have had an instructive, constructive and useful discussion about the regulations and the order. I hope I can answer all the questions that have been raised.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000003"></a>All three noble Lords who contributed raised the issue of the public awareness campaign. I should explain that the key issue about the expense of the campaign was that it would be expensive in terms of effectiveness, not because it was costly. If it had been costly but we thought it would be effective, we would have gone ahead with it. After reading through the documentation, the issue for us was to find the most effective way of dealing with the matter other than through a public awareness campaign that could not be targeted at particular groups but would address the whole country. It might involve media adverts, including television and radio. It could cost anything up to several million pounds but the likely outcome could not be certain. In promoting the effect of the regulations, including the option to withhold identifying information from disclosure, we decided that it would be best to have a targeted campaign-which would involve discussions with patient groups, research bodies and other researchers-and to raise awareness in that way rather than through a wide-ranging advertising campaign. There are, of course, many groups involved in these issues.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, asked about the circumstances under which information would be released, as did other noble Lords. An application for research would normally be successful only where the research bodies applying to the HFEA had demonstrated that the project was both necessary and expedient in the public interest and in the interests of improving patient care. They must be able to demonstrate that the aims of the project cannot be achieved by other means-this is very important-such as the use of anonymised data or partial data sets where consent can be obtained, and that it is not practicable to obtain consent to the disclosure from the person or persons to whom the information relates. The regulations go into some detail and there are many hoops through which researchers must jump before they are allowed to access this information.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000005"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Bates, raised the issue of penalties for failure. There is no power in the regulations to create offences. None the less, the research establishment has to be granted approval and would be expected to have high standards. It would also be subject to the penalties applicable to any breach of the Data Protection Act which would still cover this information. So not only would the establishment have its research disrupted and permission withdrawn, it would also be subject to the legalities of the Data Protection Act.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000006"></a>The noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raised the issue of Regulation 8(1)(c) regarding researchers not contacting people on the register and a child not being advised. The HFEA will set out in the authorisation  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC301"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its requirements regarding contacting people as a result of IVF, and it has enormous experience of doing that. We would expect it carefully to regulate this process and to have regard to the concerns identified by the noble Earl. There would have to be a very strong case for there to be direct first-contact by a research team rather than a person known to the patient. This would obviously have to be dealt with with great sensitivity. Such contact would have to be sanctioned by the HFEA to ensure that it was done in a way that has been agreed and was intended. It would be likely only in very specialised circumstances.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000007"></a>The noble Earl raised the matter of the culture media using IVF laboratories not being regulated. I am not sure that the noble Earl put it quite like that, but that was my understanding. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 3(8) to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, as amended, requires the persons responsible at licensed IVF clinics to ensure that all equipment and materials are appropriate for use and do not endanger the safety or quality of gametes and embryos. The Act does not directly regulate the manufacture or import of culture media.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000008"></a>The issue of regulation has been the subject of discussion between the HFEA and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. In July 2008, the MHRA wrote to the HFEA to say that the European Union's classification and borderline working group had concluded that culture media was a class 3 medical device, therefore bringing it within the MHRA's area of interest. As such, the MHRA advised that it accepts the culture media carrying the CE mark as suitable for use in IVF treatment. I will be happy to let the noble Earl have a copy of that letter. It gives an extremely well informed and detailed exposition on the issue and will almost certainly be noted by the people who have an interest in this matter.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000009"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked what information the HFEA register holds. The register records information relating to the provision of treatment services, including IVF, the use of donated gametes or embryos and, where known, the outcome of the treatment cycle. It records the storage and use of donated sperm, eggs and embryos, and the procurement, distribution and use of donated sperm provided by non-medical fertility services for home insemination, such as those which operate through the internet.</p>

<p><a name="10031842000010"></a>The HFEA instructs fertility clinics on the information that they must provide for the register by means of a direction made under Section 24 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Outcomes, including births, must be notified to the HFEA, but outcomes may not be known for parents who perhaps return abroad after treatment. To that extent, the register may not be complete.</p>

<p><a name="10031842000011"></a>The issue of periods of renewals was raised by several noble Lords. The period for research would be five years. There are at present no restrictions on the number of renewals but each would require the agreement of the HFEA and would be one of the issues monitored by the committee, as I outlined in my opening remarks.</p>

<p><a name="10031842000012"></a>On the second parental order instrument, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked whether the Government intended to review the regulation of surrogacy. The  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC302"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC302</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>answer is yes. We made a commitment that we would do so during the review of the 1990 Act that led to the 2008 Act. We have not yet, however, committed to a timescale for that review.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000013"></a>The noble Earl asked also about children who may become stateless. It is an important question. The law in the UK does not make provision for the automatic recognition of overseas surrogacy arrangements. However, UK law makes provision for parental orders. It strikes the right balance between the need to ensure the welfare of the child and the rights of the commissioning couple. Commissioning couples, if domiciled in the UK, are subject to UK law. My understanding is that if one had gone through the parental order, as in an adoption, the child would then have UK nationality. Parents who go down this road have to inform themselves in advance of the hurdles that they will have to overcome to achieve a surrogate child through that process.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000014"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked about the adoption of children by same-sex couples. Same-sex and unmarried couples can enter into surrogacy arrangements. However, before the regulations come into force, their child would have to be adopted. We do not think that any children are in limbo as a result of this because the adoption route still exists until the regulations come into force.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000015"></a>I hope that I have covered the points raised during the debate. However, I shall read through my notes and make sure that I write to noble Lords if I have omitted any matter of detail. I thank noble Lords for their comments and questions.</p>

<p><a name="10031842000018"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10031842000081"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, in moving this Motion, I shall speak also to the Environmental Civil Sanctions (Miscellaneous Amendments) (England) Regulations 2010. Most people and businesses set out to comply with the law. Clear regulation, raising awareness, and authoritative advice and guidance from regulators remain the key to securing compliance. Enforcement is a small but necessary part of effective regulation. Following the report on regulatory sanctions by Professor Richard Macrory, it is clear that enforcement has relied too much on criminal prosecution and fines. Prosecution is sometimes heavy-handed, but there is often no proportionate alternative. Sometimes enforcement is inadequate because a sanction is necessary but nothing proportionate is available.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000019"></a>The Government wish to give the Environment Agency and Natural England the option to use the civil sanctions allowed by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. The order and regulations, which introduce these civil sanctions in England, are a first crucial step in creating a system of enforcement across environmental regulation in England and Wales. The system will be fairer, more proportionate, and more effective, so it delivers better outcomes. This intermediate tier of civil sanctions may be applied to businesses and others with a good general approach to compliance who have nevertheless failed in their precautions. Of course, in many cases, as now, sanctions are not needed; I should emphasise that regulator advice and guidance will remain the foundation of environmental enforcement.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000020"></a>Civil sanctions would carry less stigma than a conviction. The worst offenders will be prosecuted; a conviction for an environmental offence will then carry the opprobrium that it deserves and be a stronger incentive to compliance in the future. The Government plan to bring forward legislation to give the courts additional sentencing powers in environmental cases to assist them in proportionate sentencing of the worst offenders. This would include a power for the courts generally to be able to order restoration of environmental harm or restitution to adversely affected third parties. The Government plan a further consultation on the details of the proposed powers. With the order and regulations we are taking a big step towards an improved environment-wide enforcement system, first, for the offences listed in the order and regulations, and in further planned legislation, for breaches of permits in particular.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC304"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000021"></a>The order contains rules governing use of the civil sanctions. Parts 1 to 4 contain general provisions, such as for appeals. Schedules 1 to 4 provide for the particular sanctions. Schedule 5 applies selected civil sanctions to particular offences in primary legislation. For technical legal reasons, the regulations are needed to extend the sanctions to particular offences in secondary legislation. This legislation introduces no new regulatory requirements. Additional costs of the new system will fall mainly on the non-compliant, and most on the least compliant. The benefits will be greater: a more level playing-field for compliant businesses and environmental benefits from discouraging offending and more direct restoration. For the first time, a regulator will be able to accept a business's binding commitment to remedy non-compliance and its ill effects, with benefits to the business's reputation. These enforcement undertakings will streamline enforcement, put compliance and restoration first and encourage dialogue between the regulator and business.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000022"></a>For the more serious cases that are still suitable for civil sanctions, regulators must be able to impose a proportionate monetary penalty. The variable monetary penalty aims to be the minimum economic deterrent to future non-compliance. It aims to level the playing field for compliant businesses. The approach to calculation is set out in published government guidance. Securing compliance, restoring harm and restitution to affected parties will still take priority over paying the monetary penalty. Responding to business comment, we have kept those variable monetary penalties not already kept by the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act. The £250,000 upper limit for an offence will continue to drive the most serious offences to the criminal courts.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000023"></a>This legislation also fills important gaps in regulator enforcement powers. It will introduce compliance, restoration and stop notices and fixed monetary penalties where they are needed. Fixed monetary penalties will be appropriate mainly where lesser non-compliance remains, despite regulator advice and guidance. The order also gives the regulators the minimum additional powers to enable effective use of the new sanctions for cases where the expected co-operation is not forthcoming. Regulators are engaging with businesses, large and small, as they consult on their plans for implementing the new system.</p>

<p><a name="10031842000024"></a>The Better Regulation Executive's independent reviewers have given the regulators positive assessments against the Hampton principles of good regulation. The government guidance also sets the framework for proportionate and consistent regulator use of civil sanctions, for government monitoring, and for review after two years. No civil sanction will be imposed without senior manager oversight. I am satisfied that civil sanctions will be used in accordance with better regulation principles.</p>

These improvements have received overall support from business organisations as well as others. I beg to move.</p>

I suppose I should say that I am a farmer and grower. I declare that interest because agriculture features in quite a lot of regulatory matters concerning the environment. However, if I may say so, providing for civil sanctions through a regulator tribunal-based system also provides for a much more flexible approach to environmental regulation and control. To the extent that they decriminalise infractions where appropriate and use civil means of redress, they are very welcome.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000028"></a>I am pleased that we can use the opportunity of approving these draft orders and regulations to clarify the ways in which the Government intend them to work and the thinking that lies behind them. Therefore, if I appear to be a bit pedantic, it is because I should like to give the Minister the opportunity to clarify certain elements.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000029"></a>The miscellaneous amendment regulations allow Natural England and the Environment Agency to apply specified punishments for breaching certain aspects of nine separate regulations laid as far back as 1989 and as recently as 2008. The basic order does the same thing for offences under 13 Acts passed between 1932 and 2003.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000030"></a>Both drafts refer throughout to an application in England, whereas in the Explanatory Memorandum-I refer the Minister particularly to pages 10, 11, 12 and 39-reference is made to England and Wales. The evidence base for the impact assessment refers to the Countryside Council for Wales, and therefore I hope I am right in assuming that the quantification of the impact assessment and the cost-benefit analysis on which these proposals are based is found across both countries. It would be useful to have confirmation of that.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000031"></a>In the Explanatory Memorandum, the Government are at pains to explain that the idea is to reduce the cost of prosecution while improving the level of discipline. Thus fixed penalties will be levied at £100 for an individual or £300 for a corporate body. The Explanatory Memorandum then states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031842000063"></a>"The relatively low level reflects the significant reputational impact expected from the publicly recorded use of a fixed monetary penalty".</p>

<p><a name="10031842000059"></a>My problem is that I cannot find in either draft any reference to the publication of fixed penalties, and I would be grateful if the Minister could enlighten me about the process that will be used to ensure the full reputational impact and the statute under which that process will be invoked. An offence that could be tried in a magistrates' court or the Crown Court may be subject to a variable penalty of not more than £250,000, above which the regulator would consider prosecution. Does that mean that if the regulator rejects that possibility the offender will get away with £250,000 for an offence that should cost him rather more than that?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000032"></a>The regulator may also impose a financial penalty on anyone who fails to comply with a compliance notice. The penalty will be a percentage-perhaps as  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC306"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>high as 100 per cent-of the cost of fulfilling the conditions of the compliance notice. Do the Government have in mind a limit above which prosecution will be the preferred option? Is it a monetary question or does it depend on the degree of flagrant abuse of the regulations? What will happen to the financial penalties levied by the regulator? Who takes possession of them?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000033"></a>The regulator may impose a restoration notice in the case of offences under regulations covering the use of sludge in agricultural use, the control of pollution from oil storage, the water resources regulations 2003, the hazardous waste regulations 2005 and the nitrate pollution prevention regulations. It seems that the first and last relate to farming in the main and that the scale and scope of the pollution resulting from a farmer's mistake is likely to be of a different order of magnitude, almost by definition, than many other pollution incidents. Do the Government have in mind any guidance to ensure that farmers are not unduly penalised simply because, by the time an error is measurable, it is already serious to severe?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000034"></a>In the analysis and evidence at the bottom of page 12 of the Explanatory Memorandum, the letters N/A appear eight times. Do they mean the same thing each time and do they mean "not applicable" or "not available"? Perhaps the Minister will explain. For example, they are used for each type of organisation whether micro, small, medium or large under the heading "annual cost per organisation", yet in response to the question,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031842000064"></a>"Are any of these organisations exempt?",</p>

<p><a name="10031842000060"></a>we see "No" for micro and small organisations but N/A for medium and large ones. More importantly, N/A appears in response to:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10031842000065"></a>"Will implementation go beyond minimum EU requirements?".</p>

<p><a name="10031842000061"></a>It is important that we have an explanation because it would probably be quite clear if we understood the underlying code.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000035"></a>Page 7 of the Explanatory Memorandum states that the legislation applies to small business. Does that mean that it will not apply to big business? If so, how will the two be differentiated? Finally, how many First-tier Tribunals will there be and what will be the maximum distance an appellant will have to travel to have his case heard?</p>

<p><a name="10031842000036"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10031842000083"></a>Lord Tope:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the statutory instrument and explaining it very fully to us. I, too, welcome the introduction of civil sanctions. As the Minister said in his introduction, they are a useful tool between what can sometimes be the heavy hand of criminal prosecution, with all that goes with that, and the alternative of no prosecution at all.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000037"></a>I am reasonably familiar in other aspects of life with the use of civil sanctions. I speak as a member of a local authority that sometimes resorts to such measures, and I know that they act both as a deterrent and, sometimes, as an incentive. From both points of view, that is useful. The powers given here will be valuable in encouraging and, where necessary, ensuring compliance, not by the worst offenders, for whom criminal prosecution is probably the only way, but by those who, in the main, might wish to comply but, perhaps, do not try

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000038"></a>These statutory instruments were debated in another place on Tuesday and many of the questions and concerns were answered there. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, asked a number of useful, helpful and pertinent questions, and I look forward to the Minister's reply. I do not need to repeat what was said in another place or what has already been said here.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000039"></a>I have one remaining concern. It was addressed in another place, but not completely. It relates to the power of entry granted under these regulations. I understand the necessity, but Parliament needs to be very cautious when extending powers of entry still further. I shall not rehearse the hundreds, I think now thousands, of instances where power of entry is granted, but it is an area of proper concern over which we need to be cautious. We need to understand exactly what we are granting. In another place, the Minister said that the powers under these orders are similar to those already enjoyed by the Environment Agency. Does "similar to" mean "the same as" or "not quite the same as"? If it means "not quite the same as", what is the difference between the powers granted here and the powers that the Environment Agency already has?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000040"></a>I know that this does not apply to domestic premises and we hope that in all cases those whose premises are being entered will always co-operate and comply, but it is inevitable that, sometimes, that will not happen. What happens when right of entry is refused and confrontation perhaps ensues? What power is available? Does it require police action or court action, and what sanction is there should that happen?</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000041"></a>Those are my main outstanding concerns, given the debate that has taken place in another place and in this place. I look forward to the Minister's answers and give a general welcome to these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="10031842000042"></a><b><a name="100318-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10031842000084"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b><b></b>I thank noble Lords who have spoken for their general welcome of these regulations. I shall try to answer the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and will then deal with power of entry. The impact assessment covered England and Wales. The vision of the Government and the Welsh Assembly is for an enforcement system that is more proportionate, fairer and more effective across England and Wales. The Welsh Assembly Government are bringing forward similar legislation to allow the Environment Agency to use civil sanctions in Wales. The separate legislation is to allow more flexibility in the handling of the legislative process in Wales and any detailed amendments needed because Welsh regulation is slightly different. However, the impact assessment was for both.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000043"></a>The noble Lord wants to understand the details of how fixed monetary penalties will be published and which part of the legislation provides for that. Regulators will follow the government guidance, which explains that they will be required to publish the details of any enforcement action taken using civil sanctions. The Government consider it good practice for a regulator to maintain a public register on a website of civil  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC308"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sanctioning decisions it has taken as well as of criminal convictions. When the register is developed, it will be important that it points out that criminal convictions are of greater seriousness than civil sanctions and that a VMP is of greater seriousness than other sanctions. The Environment Agency's current consultation on implementing civil sanctions states that it considers,</p>
<ul><a name="10031842000066"></a>"that publishing information on our enforcement activities raises awareness of the need to comply, and acts as a specific deterrent to the individual offender and as a general deterrent to others".</ul>
<p><a name="10031842000062"></a>Article 14 of the draft order sets out the requirements that the regulator must follow when publishing details of any civil sanctions it has imposed.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, asked whether, if the regulator decided to serve a VMP rather than to prosecute, an offender could get away with a £250,000 penalty for an offence that should have cost him more. In the most serious cases, regulators will still prosecute rather than apply civil sanctions. The Government hope that the courts will see the fact that they continue to prosecute such offences as a clear signal of the seriousness of the breach. Further, the Government are considering bringing forward further primary legislation to strengthen the hand of the courts in sentencing proportionately in such circumstances, particularly for requiring appropriate restoration. The £250,000 upper limit will not be a limit on the amount of restoration that an offender may need to undertake. The Government will carefully review the existence, level and effect of the £250,000 cap as part of their two-year review. The point raised by the noble Lord is not fully covered, but we intend to review the criminal law to bring the penalty even more into line and to keep going back to restoration and graduated, proportionate penalties.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000045"></a>The noble Lord asked whether the Government had in mind a maximum limit for non-compliance penalties above which prosecution would be the preferred option. The Government do not have in mind any financial threshold above which prosecution would become appropriate. The regulator will make a decision on whether prosecution is appropriate on a range of factors of the kind set out in section 3 of the Government's guidance, including whether prosecution would be the route most likely to change behaviour. I have looked at the regulation; it is a complex matrix of proportionality and use of prosecution to signal the seriousness of behaviour. It is designed to change behaviour so that compliance is the norm.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000046"></a>I was asked what would happen to the financial penalties levied by the regulator. The Government require all financial penalties recovered by regulators to be passed to the Consolidated Fund. Therefore, there is no financial incentive for regulators to levy penalties. However, regulators may recover their reasonable investigation costs from offenders in civil sanctions just as they currently can when they prosecute in the criminal courts. To do so, they will need to serve an enforcement cost recovery notice and may be required to provide a detailed breakdown of the cost to the recipient of such notices. Further, where they seek to recover their costs, any financial penalty payable is reduced by that amount. Finally, offenders may also pay money to make amends to third parties adversely

Once again, such amounts reduce the financial penalty.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000047"></a>The noble Lord asked whether there was any government guidance to ensure that farmers are not unduly penalised due to their error already having becoming serious by the time their error is measured. Regulators imposing a variable monetary penalty will ensure that the penalty is proportionate to the circumstances of the case. However, they will also take into account a farmer's ability to pay or carry out restoration work in determining the penalty to be paid. In cases of potential or real hardship, the regulator may consider delaying collection of a penalty until the farmer's ability to pay, and the relationship with any reduction under the cross-compliance scheme, is understood.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000048"></a>The noble Lord wanted to know what the eight "N/A"s mean. I am not sure that I have all eight answers, but I shall do my best. In each case where "N/A" is used in the analysis of the evidence base, it means "not applicable" Here, we are the prisoners of-I know from years on the Merits Committee-the introduction of a pro forma, which calls for the filling in of a box. Sometimes N/A is the right answer. In each case where it appears in the analysis and evidence-base, N/A means "not applicable". Annual costs per organisation is not applicable for any micro, small, medium or large organisation because these proposals do not introduce annual costs for an organisation in the sense of standing, ongoing costs. Costs depend on an organisation's non-compliance. As to whether any of these organisations are exempt, the impact assessment template is concerned only with whether there are exemptions for micro and small businesses. Therefore, the words "not applicable" are automatically inserted for medium and large businesses.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000049"></a>The question of whether implementing will go beyond minimum EU requirements is relevant to where a piece of legislation transposes EU law. This legislation is entirely domestic, so the question is not therefore applicable.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000050"></a>The noble Lord asked whether this legislation was being equally applied to small businesses as to big businesses and, if so, how the two were being differentiated. The enforcement provisions will apply to any business, whether small or large. We are back to our pro forma. I understand that this section of the EM has to be written with those opening words. The regulator's enforcement decisions will have regard to factors such as the seriousness of the non-compliance and the attitude and approach of the business concerned. As I mentioned earlier, the regulator will take the business's ability to pay into account.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000051"></a>The noble Lord also wanted to know how many first-tier tribunals there will be and what would be the maximum distance. The Tribunals Service will ensure that the first-tier tribunal hearings take place in locations around the country that will be convenient for the parties concerned. This is a new area of activity, but I understand that the Tribunals Service has indicated that it will have that flexibility to move about in order to make it easier for people.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000052"></a>I spent some considerable time asking the team questions about power of entry, so now forgive me for  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC310"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column GC310</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the rather long answer that it has produced for me. The power is proportionate and necessary to allow Natural England to observe whether various civil sanctions are being complied with-for example, measures to restore harm, prevent further harm or to comply with the law. It achieves the necessary balance between sufficient powers to enforce and adequate protection to individuals. The power has been approved by the Home Office. The power is qualified: it may be used only at a reasonable time and no force may be exercised to gain entry. Proof of authorisation shall be produced if required. The power may not be used to enter a part of someone's premises that is used exclusively for domestic purposes, thus preserving the right to respectful privacy and liberty in the home. Nor does it allow seizure of any information or material, for example.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000053"></a>Furthermore, the extent of the power is substantially similar to the powers conferred upon the authorised officers of the Environment Agency by virtue of Section 108 of the Environment Act 1995. It would not make sense for the Environment Agency to be able to enter premises for this purpose, but for Natural England not to have a similar power in relation to the offences enforced by it.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000054"></a>If entry is refused, it is envisaged that further regulatory advice and guidance will ensue. If this proves to be unsuccessful and the regulator is satisfied that non-compliance persists, in certain circumstances it would be open to the regulator to impose a monetary non-compliance penalty. Alternatively, where no variable monetary penalty has been imposed in respect of the conduct giving rise to the offence, the regulator may bring criminal proceedings. It would normally be in the interests of a business to demonstrate to the regulator that it has complied with the civil sanction. If it chooses not to do so, the regulator may consider alternative action in relation to the offence in question or may review how the business is dealt with in the future. It will come out in the guidance. Previous performance of a business can be taken into account in sanctions in subsequent events. The Government will monitor this issue and it will be subject to review two years after introduction.</p>

<a name="100318-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10031842000055"></a>Finally, I thank noble Lords for their support. What is fascinating about being a government Whip is that you regularly do things that you know absolutely nothing about. I did not know anything about this area a week ago, but I have throughout my professional career been involved with regulation and compliance. This is a really good example of government, by which I mean little "g" government and the people behind me, flogging through areas that need protection-in this case the environment-and looking at how to get compliance. To get that, you have to have regulation and you have to be able to apply it. This is all built around encouraging compliance, putting restoration first and, in a sense, penalties last. This is a great step forward in this sort of regulation.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="10031844000003"></a><b><a name="100318-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="10031844000103"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Baroness Thornton):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Gillian Merron) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="10031844000004"></a>We are today laying before Parliament the Government's response (Cm 7832) to the Health Select Committee report on alcohol, which was published on 8 January 2010.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="10031844000005"></a>The range of the Health Select Committee's inquiry and its report recognise the scale and complexity of the challenge we face. Alcohol is a rapidly rising major public health challenge and the Government have been working hard to address it, but there is no single action we can take to change our culture overnight.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="10031844000006"></a>The Government's response welcomes the Health Select Committee's thorough and far-reaching report on alcohol. Whilst we are working to deliver our current strategy, we believe that its recommendations will make an important and lasting contribution to the ways in which the Government and society regard this important issue.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="10031844000007"></a>The breadth of the committee's inquiry and the nature of the report have required in-depth consultations across government. In particular, the department has liaised closely and extensively on this response with those other departments called to give oral evidence to the Committee; the Treasury, the Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Each of those departments has also wished to ensure that the committee received the fullest response where their areas of responsibility and those of the Department of Health coincide.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="10031844000008"></a>The Government take the health and social harms caused by alcohol seriously and our government strategy on alcohol recognises the challenges we face as a society.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10031844000009"></a>Action on alcohol requires close working between sectors and departments, and a careful balance between protecting the rights of the individual and protecting the health of the nation.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10031844000010"></a>The comprehensive strategy we have in place tackles these problems in four main areas:</p>
to help people make informed decisions (e.g. information and education campaigns and labelling). The committee recognises that information and education policies have a role as part of a comprehensive strategy;to create a healthier environment (e.g. through licensing and enforcement regimes). The committee has welcomed the mandatory code on alcohol retailing and called for its early introduction;to provide advice, support and treatment for people at risk (e.g. providing "brief interventions" in primary care and treatment services for dependent drinkers).  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS78"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column WS78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We welcome the committee's view that early detection and intervention in alcohol-related ill health are both effective and cost-effective; andto improve the underpinning delivery system to support those services (e.g. from 2008 the Government created the first ever indicator for primary care trusts to tackle alcohol-related hospital admissions. Our alcohol improvement programme supports PCTs taking action in this area).
<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10031844000011"></a>Current levels of alcohol-related hospital admissions, crime, and deaths are unacceptable. Much more can, and will, be done to turn around the drinking culture in this country. We are currently taking forward action on a mandatory code to tackle the irresponsible promotion of alcohol. New and strengthened campaigns this year will raise public awareness further on the link between drinking too much and poor health, and on the harm that alcohol can do to children.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS79"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column WS79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10031844000018"></a>Following the decision of the Supreme Court quashing the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006, and its indication that the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009 was vulnerable to being quashed on the same basis as the 2006 order, Parliament passed the Asset-Freezing (Temporary Provisions) Act 2010 in February. The Act restores the validity in law of the UK's terrorist asset-freezing regime until 31 December 2010, providing a period for Parliament to consider and pass more permanent legislation without in the mean time incurring a gap in our terrorist asset-freezing regime that would have damaged national security.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="10031844000019"></a>The Government have set out their proposals for permanent terrorist asset-freezing legislation in the draft Terrorist Asset-Freezing Bill that was published on 5 February 2010. The structure of the draft Bill closely follows that of the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009 and contains a number of safeguards to protect human rights, for example the requirement that asset freezes can only be made where necessary for public protection and the requirement that asset freezes expire after 12 months unless the Treasury has reviewed the case and made a fresh decision to renew the asset freeze.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="10031844000020"></a>The Government are fully committed to ensuring that there is proper transparency and accountability to Parliament with respect to the operation of the terrorist asset-freezing regime. That is why since December 2006, the Treasury has reported quarterly to Parliament on the operation of the terrorist asset-freezing regime. The most recent report was laid on 8 March 2010.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="10031844000021"></a>The draft Terrorist Asset-Freezing Bill will further strengthen transparency and accountability to Parliament, by enshrining in law the requirement to report quarterly to Parliament on the operation of the terrorist asset-freezing regime, and by requiring an annual independent review of the asset-freezing regime, with a report following such a review to be laid before Parliament.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="10031844000022"></a>Consistent with our commitment to transparency, the Government have made it clear that they wish there to be full and proper scrutiny of our proposals for new terrorist asset-freezing legislation. These are important legislative proposals. It is right that members of the public and other interested parties should have the opportunity to consider the proposals and submit views and evidence. And it is right that Parliament's consideration of the legislation in due course should be informed by the views and evidence of the public and interested parties. This is why the Government proposed a sunset clause of 31 December 2010 in the temporary legislation-to allow sufficient time for external views and evidence to be gathered and considered by Parliament when it scrutinises the new legislation.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="10031844000023"></a>The Government are today launching a public consultation exercise on the draft Terrorist Asset-Freezing Bill, which will close in three months' time on 18 June 2010. The consultation document, which would complement and aid any future scrutiny by Members of both Houses or a select committee, if that is the decision of Parliament, explains the background to terrorist asset freezing: the terrorist threat and the role of finance in supporting terrorism; the international framework for terrorist asset freezing; and the UK's current approach to terrorist asset freezing. The  


<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS80"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column WS80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consultation document also sets out how our current terrorist asset-freezing legislation works and explains the provisions in the proposed new terrorist asset-freezing legislation. The consultation particularly invites views on the following questions:</p>
 does the draft Bill set out the most effective way of meeting our UN obligations and protecting national security whilst also ensuring sufficient safeguards in respect of human rights? do you have any views on the current operation of the UK's asset-freezing regime under the terrorism orders? anddoes the regulatory impact assessment accurately reflect the costs and benefits of the regime? Is there more that can be done to reduce the costs for the financial sector and others in implementing the regime whilst maintaining its effectiveness? 
<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="10031844000024"></a>The Government hope that the consultation exercise will be useful in stimulating public debate on these important issues and that it will provide a valuable source of views and evidence that will assist Parliament in scrutinising the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Bill in due course.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="10031844000025"></a>The Government are keen to work with parliamentary committees and all Members of both Houses of Parliament to seek to achieve a cross-party approach to taking forward the draft legislation.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="10031844000026"></a><b><a name="100318-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="10031844000107"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> The Government are committed to ensuring that everyone has access to justice and that justice is provided locally. We need to ensure that we have a modern court estate that is properly aligned to where services are needed, that the estate is efficiently utilised and that courts have the necessary facilities for victims and witnesses and to allow proper access for court users with disabilities. On 13 October, I announced full public consultations on the closure of a number of underused courts.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="10031844000027"></a>The Government must always look to ensure there is an effective and efficient system to deliver justice so that we can continue to provide these vital public services at a level that offers real value for money for the taxpayer. Therefore, after careful consideration and following the public consultations, I am today announcing the closure of the following underused courts:</p>
Bourne Magistrates' Court;Bridport Magistrates' Court; Cheshunt Magistrates' Court; Cullompton Magistrates' Court; Dorking Magistrates' Court; Eastleigh Magistrates' Court; Gainsborough Magistrates' Court; Havant Magistrates' Court; Launceston Magistrates' Court; Louth Magistrates' Court; Mildenhall Magistrates' Court; Minehead Magistrates' Court;

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="10031844000028"></a>I have not yet made a final decision on the proposed closure of Leigh County Court. I am still considering this matter and will make an announcement in due course.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="10031844000029"></a>It is right that going to court should not place undue stress on the victims and witnesses of crime. Her Majesty's Courts Service has made significant improvements in the facilities for these court users over recent years. These improvements have helped to make giving evidence in court less stressful. We need to ensure that court buildings have suitable facilities for all court users. Many of the courts listed above are significantly underutilised and do not have adequate facilities for victims and witnesses. In addition a number of the buildings do not allow adequate access for disabled court users. Due to the low utilisation rates and in some courts, physical constraints, I do not believe it would provide good value for money to spend taxpayers' money to bring these buildings up to the required standard.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="10031844000030"></a>Magistrates' courts developed in certain locations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when areas of local government (then responsible for these courts) were much smaller and transport links were elementary. It is no longer necessary to have a court in every small town. This was recognised by many of the former Magistrates' Courts Committees who made a very significant number of closures. Successive Governments have in recent decades had to undertake closure programmes. Since 1997, the Government, with this announcement, will have closed 171 courts, compared with 450 courts which were closed between 1979 and 1997. Our plans ensure that communities have access to good quality local courts within a reasonable travelling distance. We have considered the suitability and proximity of nearby courts which can meet the needs of the community. Most of the courts affected are not currently hearing cases. Therefore, cases in that area have been heard at a nearby court which has not caused significant disruption to court users. In many cases the better facilities available have improved their experience at court.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="10031844000031"></a>The consultation papers asked respondents to comment on any impacts that closure may have. In light of the responses received, I am confident that the closures will not have a significant adverse impact on the provision of local justice. Indeed, as many respondents noted, these closures will assist the delivery of modern justice services and provide communities with better, more efficient facilities.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="10031844000034"></a>The Secretary of State will be making changes to the discretionary Social Fund in relation to direction 17, with effect from 1 April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="10031844000035"></a>With effect from 1 April, a new benefit sanction for all first offences of benefit fraud "one strike" will be introduced along with a sanction for those jobseeker's allowance claimants who fail to attend their fortnightly reviews. Direction 17 of the discretionary Social Fund will be amended to take account of these new sanctions. This will ensure that all healthy childless people with no caring responsibilities who apply for a crisis loan, regardless of which benefit they receive, will not be able to counter a benefit sanction by applying for a crisis loan for living expenses. As now, they will be able to apply for a crisis loans to alleviate the consequences of a disaster or for the expenses for items for cooking or heating when there is a proven risk to their health or safety.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="10031844000040"></a>The first Transport Council of the Spanish presidency was held in Brussels on 11 March. The United Kingdom was represented by Andy Lebrecht, Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="10031844000041"></a>The council agreed a general approach on a directive on transportable pressure equipment. The directive aims to revoke obsolete directives on pressure equipment and therefore remove conflicts between EU law and international rules on the transport of dangerous goods.

The United Kingdom supports this general approach.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="10031844000042"></a>There was a progress report on the proposal for a directive on aviation security charges. The Commission noted that the subject, and notably the question of who should pay for any more stringent security measures, was complex and that there were no obvious solutions. The first reading and vote from the European Parliament is scheduled to take place in April. Following that vote the presidency will examine the proposal and decide how it should be taken forward. The council agreed to the presidency approach and took note of the progress report. The United Kingdom is content with this approach.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="10031844000043"></a>The council reached a general approach on a regulation on investigation and prevention of accidents and incidents in civil aviation. The regulation seeks to facilitate the standardisation of legislation and co-operation in the investigation of accidents and incidents in civil aviation. A number of interventions were made by the majority of delegations (including the UK) in support of the presidency text, with comments being made on the independence of the network, the participation of EASA in safety investigations, the role of judicial authorities, the protection of sensitive safety information and release of passenger lists following an accident. There was general consensus that these issues could be addressed as the European Parliament proceeds with its consideration of the proposal. The United Kingdom supports this general approach.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="10031844000044"></a>There was an update from the Commission on progress in the negotiations on a second stage EU-US air transport agreement. The Commission noted the good progress made in widening the scope of the agreement to include environmental, labour and regulatory issues. While the US Congress was currently unwilling to relax investment and ownership in US airlines, it was felt that the US had conceded some useful points that would make the agreement mutually beneficial. The Commission raised the three outstanding issues of liberalisation, noise and commercial rights. Member states were broadly supportive of the Commission's approach and welcomed the recent progress on environmental matters. However there were several interventions by delegations seeking to ensure that the final agreement strikes the right balance. The council urged to Commission to continue negotiations on this basis.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="10031844000047"></a>I am today announcing the publication of the Government's response to the ICL inquiry report.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="10031844000048"></a>The Government's response (CM7849) has been laid before Parliament and will be published later today. In publishing the response I would like to once again extend my condolences to the families and friends of those killed and injured in the factory explosion at ICL Plastics Ltd in Glasgow on 11 May 2004, and thank Lord Gill for his work and his considered recommendations following this tragic-and avoidable-event.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="10031844000049"></a>On 16 July, I announced the publication of Lord Gill's report into the underlying causes of the explosion at ICL Plastics, resulting from a leak of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). As part of his report, Lord Gill recommended a four phase action plan to secure the safe operation of small bulk LPG installations. The plan consisted of:</p>
a systematic replacement of buried metallic service pipes with polyethylene pipes and inspection of buildings with an LPG supply;the establishment of a new safety regime for small bulk LPG installations including the introduction of an independent verification scheme;the continuing development of the safety regime with particular reference to polyethylene pipes; andimprovements in knowledge and information sharing between regulators, and LPG suppliers and users.
<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="10031844000050"></a>On 14 September, I announced the publication of HSE's progress report which set out details of the programme to replace buried metallic pipe work with polyethylene pipes, supported by an inspection campaign by HSE and local authority inspectors. This work is now well under way.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="10031844000051"></a>The progress report also announced the launch of a consultation exercise seeking stakeholder views on Lord Gill's remaining recommendations. We are grateful to those who responded to the consultation for their helpful comments. Having considered these responses and advice from the HSE board, the Government are now able to publish their full response to the ICL inquiry.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="10031844000052"></a>The Government support the majority of Lord Gill's proposals for a new LPG safety regime including the introduction of installation records for LPG users; registration of LPG suppliers; clearer demarcation of responsibilities between LPG users and suppliers; the production of an asset register by suppliers; and improved guidance for users on meeting their legal obligations. HSE will consult with stakeholders further on the details of implementation.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="10031844000053"></a>The Government have decided to not take forward Lord Gill's proposals for an independent verification scheme or for independent audits of workplace risk assessments but will instead take steps to raise awareness among users of their responsibilities within the existing legislative framework, underpinned by appropriate enforcement activity. We believe that this approach will effectively deliver the outcomes that Lord Gill envisaged.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="10031844000054"></a>The Government acknowledge the need to ensure that the replacement polyethylene pipes themselves remain safe. We have therefore asked HSE to undertake

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="10031844000055"></a>Finally, the Government agree with Lord Gill that effective communication is vital to ensuring the continuing safety of small bulk LPG installations. The HSE will work with the LPG industry to develop clear and practical advice for LPG users regarding the fulfilment of their statutory duties.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="10031844000060"></a>I am making a change to the Immigration Rules, laid before the House today, to change marriage visa age policy so that the age requirement is lowered to 18 for serving members of the Armed Forces and their partners. This recognises the role of partners in supporting those on the frontline. I believe that it is important that we give the Armed Forces special consideration to reflect the unique circumstances in which they operate.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="10031844000062"></a>Other changes I am making to the Immigration Rules today implement recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to change tier 1 and tier 2 of the points-based system.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="10031844000063"></a>The points-based system continues to provide a flexible means to better identify and attract those migrants who have the most to contribute to the UK, whilst enforcing our effective border controls against those with less to offer. Tier 1 is for the most highly skilled workers, and tier 2 for other skilled workers who have a job offer from a UK employer licensed to sponsor migrants.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="10031844000064"></a>The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) provides the Government with independent, evidence-based advice on the economic case for managed migration. The MAC published its recommendations for tier 2 on 19 August 2009, and its recommendations for tier 1 on 4 December 2009. In arriving at them, it considered evidence from hundreds of organisations. The Government have also engaged with a wide range of employers, trade unions and other organisations to ensure that the changes we make meet their needs and control migration in the best interests of the UK as a whole.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="3" year="2010" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS86"></a><b>18 Mar 2010 : Column WS86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="10031844000065"></a>I can announce today that the Government are accepting all but two of the MAC's recommended changes to tier 1. The statement of changes to the Immigration Rules laid before the House today includes new points tables for both tiers, a simpler route for very highly skilled workers without master's degrees, greater flexibility for short-term transfers by multinational companies, and more protection against such transfers being used to fill long-term vacancies that should go to resident workers.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="10031844000066"></a>We have disagreed with the committee in the awarding of points for professional qualifications held in addition to academic qualifications. We consider the approach would be complex, confusing for applicants and difficult to administer, and that operationally it would be very difficult to assess which combinations should attract particular points. So the Government have not accepted the recommendation at this time.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="10031844000067"></a>Further, the MAC recommended that the Government commission detailed analysis of the economic returns to studying at particular institutions and for particular degree subjects. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has already commissioned research which will shed more light on international students' experience of the post-study work route, the jobs they take on and whether or not the availability of post-study leave to remain was decisive in them choosing to study in the UK. The Government have therefore decided that any further consideration of this recommendation should await the outcome of that research.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="10031844000068"></a>The UK Border Agency is also publishing a statement of policy for sponsors to ensure they have as much detail as possible about the Government's response to the MAC's recommendations, including those which do not require legislative action to implement.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="10031844000069"></a>Today's rules changes also make relatively minor changes to other parts of the points-based system. Under tier 4, we are making a number of changes that will support the introduction of the new highly trusted sponsor category from 6 April. We are also amending the rules to permit sponsored researchers, who are part-way through research projects at our higher education institutions, to make an application to extend their leave under the Government authorised exchange sub-category of tier 5.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="10031844000071"></a>We are also making some changes to the requirements concerning English language qualifications for migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain in the UK. It is important that immigrants seeking permanent residence in the UK have some understanding of one of the native languages of this country (English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic) and of life in the United Kingdom. This will help to ensure that they integrate more easily into the British way of life.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="10031844000072"></a>I have today laid changes to the Immigration Rules which will ensure that all applicants relying on qualifications in English for Speakers of Other Languages will study at accredited colleges; ensuring the quality of provision and preventing the possibilities of abuse of the provisions and exploitation of migrants. I have also clarified the progression which migrants are required

<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="10031844000075"></a>We are also making some relatively minor changes to the Immigration Rules on asylum in order to clarify existing practice and procedure in the UK. These changes will have the effect of preventing asylum applicants from claiming humanitarian protection where there are serious reasons for considering that they have engaged in undesirable behaviour as set out in the rules.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="10031844000076"></a>We have also clarified interview procedures for unaccompanied asylum seeking children and have removed an unnecessary requirement for an asylum seeker to be asked to sign the interview record after their asylum interview to verify its contents.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="10031844000087"></a>On disclosure of records, whilst Mrs Mason considers that the current arrangements for sending information to the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) should be maintained, she is not persuaded that employers always need to see old and minor records. She suggests that some rules are developed to filter out such cases and that a non-statutory panel be established to provide Ministers with further advice in this area. This impacts on the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (ROA) and cannot be considered in isolation from that legislation.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="10031844000088"></a>Mrs Mason also recommends wider reform of the ROA. The Government agree that the Act needs to be looked at afresh to see what might best be considered in today's context, and that work should include public consultation, before moving to introduce any reforming legislation.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="10031844000089"></a>The other major recommendation in the review is that further work should be done around the disclosure of soft intelligence as part of enhanced criminal record checks. Mrs Mason is concerned that soft intelligence is disclosed too routinely in such circumstances and wonders whether the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) disclosure should be limited to conviction data. This is a complex area, but once again I am anxious to ensure that the disclosure process is proportionate and I will be asking officials to look at this further.</p>

<a name="10031844000099"></a><b><a name="100318-wms0002.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="10031844000116"></a>The Secretary of State for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> The Government are today publishing a consultation document and accompanying impact assessment on the European Commission proposal for a regulation on the carbon dioxide emissions of new vans.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="10031844000100"></a>We strongly support the principle of regulating van CO2. This sector of road transport accounts for a growing proportion of transport emissions, and we estimate this regulation would save millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions within the next decade. It would also improve the fuel economy of vehicles, thereby substantially reducing the running costs of those using vans as part of their business.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="10031844000101"></a>Our priority for this regulation is to set an ambitious but realistic long-term framework for the reduction of emissions from this sector. The regulation must respect the realities of the sector to ensure that it does not reduce the diversity of the van market. In some areas we believe that the Commission is broadly right, for example in making separate provision for manufacturers selling below a certain volume of vans, and in encouraging new emission-lowering technologies. For other aspects we believe the approach should be modified.</p>

<a name="100318-wms0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="10031844000102"></a>We are already taking an active part in discussions with the European Commission and other member states on this issue and outcome of the consultation will feed into our evolving position.

On 1 April 2009, the Royal Air Force was appointed lead service for the network of RRUs and the delivery of defence intermediate musculoskeletal rehabilitation, in partnership with the director of defence rehabilitation and Army and Royal Navy headquarters.</p>

This service enables those who are or who will become surplus to be given priority consideration for vacancies. Staff in the RDP usually continue working in their last directorate or are redeployed to cover short-term tasks. On average, staff spend six months in the RDP before finding a post or leaving the department. The RDP is also used by civilian staff returning from overseas postings, including in operational theatres. At 1 January 2010 there were 1,525 employees in the RDP, of which 155 were working in the London Government Office Region.</p>

The Government have already committed to the following recommendations contained with the <I>Sexualisation of Young People Review</I>:</p>
to run a public awareness campaign aimed at challenging the attitude and perceptions that lead to abuse within teenage relationships, including producing a pack for schools so that teachers can build on issues arising from the campaign;to launch an online "one-stop shop" to let parents report their worries over irresponsible marketing which sexualises children; andto support the NSPCC in its work to make manufacturers and retailers take greater responsibility for merchandise which is offensive and harmful.

The guidance will demonstrate how these issues can be addressed in relevant aspects of the curriculum.
