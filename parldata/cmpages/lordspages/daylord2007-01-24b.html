The two minutes&#146; silence, the wreath laid by Her Majesty the Queen and the other tributes placed on the Cenotaph are dedicated to all those who have suffered and died in war. The ceremony itself is traditional in nature and its emphasis remains remembrance.</p>

This is, after all, our biggest annual symbol of national memory. It rather distresses me that it is so white and unilateralist. It looks as if it is a symbol of the UK Independence Party. On their major celebration of national unity on 14 July, the French Government often invite units from other countries to participate&#151;including, two years ago, a substantial number of British units&#151;in order to symbolise the co-operation they have with other countries. Moroccan, Algerian and other troops who fought with the French in the Second World War have also attended. Could we not help to educate our younger generation, who do not remember the Second World War, about the combined effort, involving the Poles, the Indians, the Canadians and the Americans, who fought with us in the Second World War and died alongside our men and women?</p>

The French have their service on  11 November at the Arc de Triomphe and follow very much the same pattern as we do. If the noble Lord is indicating that we are not making a sufficient impact on the young, I should emphasise that more than  80 per cent of Britons, young and old, regard the two minutes&#146; silence and Remembrance Day as of great significance. Of course, all members who have served in Her Majesty&#146;s Armed Forces under British command, who cover a very wide range of ethnic communities across the world and 14 faiths, are represented at the national Service of Remembrance.</p>

No official X-rays have been taken of children since then for the reasons given by the British Dental Association and other professional bodies: the procedures are inaccurate, inappropriate and unethical. Will the Minister acknowledge that there are no studies that would enable one to compare the dental development of a child seeking asylum at one of our ports of entry against data from populations in the countries of origin, such as Eritrea or China, and to make a reasonably accurate assessment?</p>

My advice is that climate, as much as a lack of light, precludes outdoor tourism activities in winter. Therefore, it would not have quite the impact that the noble Lord suggests. Portugal abandoned Central European Time after finding that it did not work as expected and did not achieve the expected energy savings.

One reason why the public were against it was that it was sometimes dark until 10 o&#146;clock in the morning and they believed that was very dangerous for children being taken to school and for people going to work. I urge those who are going with what is the growing fashion to realise that there are some very serious objections to double summer time, as was proved during the experiment.</p>

The Government have just announced a &#163;4 million contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide emergency assistance, including water, medical supplies and rehabilitation of the health infrastructure. This brings our total humanitarian contribution for Iraq to over &#163;120 million since 2003. We are also considering the UNHCR&#146;s appeal to help refugees in neighbouring countries. Above all, the first priority of the Iraqi Government must be to end the violence that is causing this situation, with the support of the international community and the region.</p>

However, I am sure that, like other noble Lords, she will be aware that one of our closest and most loyal allies, Jordan, is being absolutely swamped by refugees from Iraq, rising towards between 700,000 and 1 million people. One in eight people in Iraq have left their homes as refugees or been displaced. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that the existing position is very bad and deteriorating rapidly, and has asked for $60 million in emergency aid to be paid immediately to help in this desperate situation. Will the Government consider what donation they might make towards that sum? Will they also consider very carefully the likelihood that the so-called surge policy of the United States Administration will yet further increase this pathetic tide of refugees?</p>

It is not that we do not intend to make a contribution but that,  as noble Lords will know, the UN has more than  &#163;200 million of unspent resources in its trust fund under the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq. We hope that some of that money can be used for humanitarian relief. If it cannot, we will certainly make a contribution to the fund.</p>

We must remember that a lot of other money is going into Iraq that we believe can assist internally displaced people and prevent refugees having to flee. We are, for example, undertaking work on capacity building to help the Iraqi Government to better manage and distribute their money and to improve services for people in Iraq so that they do not have to flee across borders and become refugees.

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="07012469000080"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, last month the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council made a Statement on the future of the United Kingdom&#146;s nuclear deterrent. On that occasion, a number of Peers rightly asked that this House be given an early opportunity to discuss the issue in more detail. I am delighted that we have that opportunity today.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="07012469000081"></a>The Government&#146;s policy in this area is informed by two central imperatives: first and foremost, to take the steps necessary to ensure, to the greatest degree possible, the future security of this country and our allies; and, secondly, to make progress towards fulfilling our vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. I believe that the White Paper achieves the right balance between those two imperatives.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="07012469000082"></a>Let me rapidly remind the House of the key decisions set out in the White Paper: we have decided to renew our minimum independent nuclear deterrent by procuring a new class of ballistic missile submarine to replace our four Vanguard-class submarines in the 2020s; we will examine whether we require three or four of the new class of submarines to maintain our posture of having a submarine always on deterrent patrol; we have decided to join the US programme to extend into the 2040s the life of the Trident D5 ballistic missiles that our submarines currently carry; and we have secured assurances from the US Government, which were published last month, giving us the option to participate in any future programme to replace the D5 missile.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="07012469000083"></a>The third component of our nuclear deterrent system is the British-designed and built warhead carried on the missiles. The White Paper indicates that decisions on the refurbishment or replacement of the warhead are likely to be required in the next Parliament but are not needed now.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="07012469000084"></a>Let me briefly summarise why some decisions are needed now. Even with a five-year extension to the  life of our existing submarines to make it around  30 years&#151;and incidentally, that will be longer than the life of any of the predecessors of the Vanguard class&#151;those submarines will start to leave service in the early 2020s.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="07012469000085"></a>Let me address head-on the claims of those who say we can run the submarines even longer. They claim that US experience with Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines proves that. The judgment we have made on boat life is based on a careful assessment of the costs and risks involved, not least given the need to replace major components that have a particular design life and the risk of a significant loss of availability, as happened at the end of the life of the previous, Resolution-class submarines. Our judgment, which has been scrupulously and thoroughly examined, is that an extension of about five years should be feasible and cost-effective, while a longer life extension would not be.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="07012469000086"></a>The comparison between the United Kingdom and the United States here is not useful. The US has land-, sea- and air-based nuclear weapons and a much more extensive capability than we have. For example, it has 14 SSBNs, while we have only four, and they are the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1106"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only nuclear deterrent system we have, so we cannot afford to take any irresponsible risks. We certainly cannot plan on that basis.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="07012469000087"></a>In addition, the Ohio boats are different from the Vanguards; they had a longer original design life, and there are major engineering differences; for example, radically different propulsion systems. If we had intended a much longer extension of the Vanguard boats, as the US intend with theirs, it would have needed to be built into their original design and their subsequent manufacture, refit and maintenance. That was not the case.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="07012469000088"></a>The assessment of our experts, which has been arrived at very carefully, is that it will take about  17 years from starting the detailed concept phase  to design, build, test and deploy replacement submarines. Seventeen years may seem a long time, but nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines are some of the most complex pieces of technology in the world. We do not get the chance to prototype them: the first boat goes to sea. It also reflects our previous experience and that of the US and France with similar submarines. So we had to act now to avoid a gap in our deterrence protection when the Vanguard class goes out of service.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07012469000089"></a>Given the need for decisions, we had to consider how the international environment might look over the 20- to 50-year horizon involved. We are the first to recognise that any attempt to look ahead that far is fraught with difficulty, and that this is ultimately a matter of judgment. We had no choice but to address the issue.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07012469000090"></a>Our judgment is that we cannot discount nuclear risks to our security over that timescale. Indeed, the White Paper goes further and says that we see potential risks in three areas, in each of which we believe our deterrent potentially has a role. The first is the possible re-emergence of a strategic nuclear threat to the UK and its allies over the longer term. Secondly, potential nuclear threats from emerging nuclear weapon states, or states with nuclear aspirations. Some of these&#151;I have in mind North Korea and Iran&#151;give us cause for concern, and there are real risks of further proliferation. Thirdly&#151;what is really a subset of the first two risks&#151;the new possibility that states may seek to deliver nuclear weapons against us using terrorist proxies.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07012469000091"></a>These risks may be exacerbated by wider trends leading to a potentially increased risk of interstate conflict: failed and failing states; the rise of extremism; and increased pressure on, and competition for, resources as a result of population growth and rising global consumption.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07012469000092"></a>It is worth noting that there is no sign that any of the other nuclear-weapon states recognised under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty&#151;the United States, Russia, France and China&#151;plan to abandon their nuclear weapons capability.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07012469000093"></a>So what is our nuclear deterrence policy? Our deterrent is intended to help ensure that nobody seeks to threaten our vital interests, and that nobody seeks to use nuclear weapons to blackmail us or the

It is not intended to coerce or threaten others; nor is it intended as a tool for war-fighting or to seek military advantage on the battlefield.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07012469000094"></a>The principles which govern our approach to nuclear deterrence are unchanged, and the White Paper spells them out: our focus is on preventing nuclear attack; we will retain only the minimum deterrent required for our security; we maintain ambiguity about the circumstances in which we might contemplate use of nuclear weapons, although we are very clear that we would consider using them only in extreme circumstances of self-defence, including the defence of our NATO allies; our deterrent supports collective security through NATO; and an independent centre of nuclear decision-making in the UK enhances the overall deterrent effect of allied nuclear forces.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07012469000095"></a>We will continue, as now, to have the flexibility to vary the number of missiles and warheads that might be employed, as well as having the option of a lower yield from our warhead. That flexibility can make our nuclear forces a more credible deterrent against smaller nuclear threats, but we remain clear that any conceivable use of our nuclear weapons&#151;at whatever scale&#151;would necessarily be strategic, both in intent and effect. Indeed, we have deliberately discontinued the use of the term sub-strategic, in the sense that it had been used previously to apply to a possible, limited use of our nuclear weapons.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07012469000096"></a>One concern that has been expressed is that our deterrent is somehow operationally dependent on the United States, or that we can be prevented from employing it. This is simply not the case. Decisions on any use of our nuclear weapons would be sovereign UK decisions, and no other country could prevent their employment. Only the Prime Minister can authorise the use of our nuclear weapons, even if the missiles are to be fired as part of a NATO response. The instruction to fire would be transmitted to the submarine using only UK codes and UK equipment. All the command and control procedures are fully independent, and the missiles do not use the global positioning satellite system: they have an inertial guidance system. Nothing in the planned Trident D5 life extension programme will change that position.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07012469000097"></a>While we have never concealed that we choose to procure certain elements of our system from the United States, I can provide assurance that the system is fully operationally independent of the United States. Successive Governments would not have sustained our nuclear deterrent on these terms were that not the case.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07012469000098"></a>Another charge levelled is that the retention and renewal of our deterrent system is illegal and, in particular, incompatible with our obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Again, that is simply not the case. The UK has been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of efforts to reduce the size of existing arsenals and to fight proliferation. We have reduced the explosive power of our nuclear weapons stockpile by over 70 per cent since the end of the Cold War. We have the smallest stockpile of any of the five recognised nuclear powers, and only we  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1108"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have reduced to a single system. We already have less than 1 per cent of the total global stockpile of nuclear weapons.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07012469000099"></a>Following careful assessment of our future deterrent needs, we have now decided to make a further 20 per cent cut, involving the dismantling of about 40 warheads. In future, the maximum number of operationally available warheads will be fewer than 160, down from fewer than 200. That will represent a reduction by about half since 1997, compared to the plans of the previous Government.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07012469000100"></a>I will briefly talk about why we chose to continue with submarines, and about costs. Submarines provide a platform that is discreet, unprovocative, invulnerable and safe. We are confident that our submarines on patrol have, in almost 40 years of continuous patrolling, never been detected by a potential opponent. I take this opportunity to pay warm tribute to the skills, professionalism and dedication of those in the Royal Navy, and the civilians who support them, who have carried out this crucial role over that period. We all owe them a considerable debt.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07012469000101"></a>To pick up another concern that noble Lords have expressed, the White Paper makes clear that we do not believe that technological advances will erode the submarines&#146; advantage in terms of invulnerability compared to other platforms. That invulnerability and assuredness is key to ensuring that we can keep our deterrent minimal and credible, and therefore  as cost-effective as possible. Apart from other disadvantages, land or air platforms would be significantly more vulnerable&#151;and would therefore require much larger numbers of aircraft or silos to achieve the same level of credible capability&#151;and therefore much more expensive.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07012469000102"></a>Submarines also enable us to stick with the D5 missile, which is a much more capable and cost-effective solution than any other&#151;certainly than the cruise missile options canvassed by some. They also mean that we can draw on existing infrastructure, industrial capacity and skills.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07012469000103"></a>Some noble Lords have expressed concern at the possibility of reducing our SSBN fleet from four to three. The White Paper makes clear that our policy is to maintain continuous deterrent patrolling. We will investigate fully whether changes in technology, operational procedures and maintenance regimes might make it practicable with the new class to do so with only three boats. Although we should not seek to pre-empt that judgement today, I can assure noble Lords that we have no intention of taking irresponsible risks with the maintenance of our deterrent posture.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07012469000104"></a>On costs, we have made clear that the investment required to renew our deterrent will not come at the expense of the conventional capabilities of our Armed Forces. Despite the claims of some who would have us believe otherwise, the Government have a strong record on defence spending. The last spending review increased the defence budget by an average of 1.4 per cent per year in real terms. The defence budget for 2007-08 will be about &#163;3.7 billion higher than in 2004-05. We have continued to make significant

Decisions on the level of our investments in nuclear and conventional capability will be taken in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review, the outcome of which will be announced later in the year.</p>

<a name="70124-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07012469000105"></a>Our initial estimate of the procurement costs for a four-submarine force is &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion, spread over more than 15 years. This estimate contains provision for the costs of the submarines, at  &#163;11 billion to &#163;14 billion, as well as for future support infrastructure requirements and any future refurbishment or replacement of the warhead. Our estimate of the submarine costs draws on our experience with other submarine programmes, as well as being built up from first principles.</p>

What he has had to say is very useful in guiding us.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="07012469000109"></a>It will come as no surprise to hear that we on this side believe that it is completely right to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent and to take the necessary steps in good time to ensure that that is achieved. For the world as it is and, sadly, is likely to be for a long time to come, we have to send a simple message: that a nuclear attack on us would be suicide for the attacker. An attempted sting will produce a fatal sting in return. That is merely repeating the grim message of deterrence. It means that in the modern world, much as it was in the world of ages now passed, a credible minimum deterrent is for us an essential part of the security jigsaw&#151;not to be used but to prevent nuclear weapons ever being used, because that would be total fatal destruction.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07012469000110"></a>All your Lordships realise that for the public&#151;those who want to know about these things&#151;that is quite a complicated proposition. Rightly, the public today require an insight into the argumentation and thinking behind that proposition from both the Government and we on this side of the House, who plan to be in government before long.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07012469000111"></a>Before getting on to that, let me say a few words about the more immediate technical aspects of the decision on which the Minister has dwelt. We respect and take in good faith the Prime Minister&#146;s view on timing. We accept that the best defence minds must have been involved in these decisions on replacement and the time needed for new designs and construction. I know these have been queried by some United States submarine experts very recently, but frankly the Opposition do not have all the facts that are available to the Government of the country. The Government do have access to those facts, as they  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1110"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should, so we cannot do anything but assume that the Prime Minister is acting completely in the national interest and on the best possible expert advice.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07012469000112"></a>I confess as a layman that 14 years does seem a long time in which to build a submarine platform. Seventeen years sounds even longer, but I suppose we have to remember that the present Vanguard-class submarines started to be built well over a decade ago, although the last one was completed only in 2001. One has only to think of the pace of technology in the past few years and the state that something as simple as the mobile telephone was in only seven or eight years ago. One needs only to see how far they have come to realise just how enormously every aspect of electronic technology, which of course is at the heart of the Vanguard and Trident systems, has altered, even in the past two or three years.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07012469000113"></a>By 2022, the present submarines will be antiques if left in their present situation. Whether we need three or four is an open question, as is the question whether with three we can manage the continuously-at-sea strategy. I reflect merely that having three, with one under repair, one being prepared and one having to be refurbished in some way, and all three observably in port, could have its obvious dangers. The secret is secrecy and the lack of knowledge of the whereabouts of the submarines, which could be jeopardised.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07012469000114"></a>I leave it to my noble friend Lord Astor to dwell on these issues at greater length at the end of the debate and with greater expertise, but I am sure he will confirm my view that decisions are now needed and cannot be delayed for very long, at least on the information that we have been given. However, as I have said, those of us who hold this view, and who therefore support the Government&#146;s direction on this matter, also owe it to the public and to your Lordships to explain something of the background and the context of our thinking. People understandably feel that it is not enough simply to say, &#147;Something is right for us; we feel it is right; that is our judgment, and that is that. Good afternoon&#148;.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07012469000115"></a>That is not good enough. Decisions of this kind may be quick to be announced but they bind for decades ahead. What is decided and proposed in this White Paper both shapes our bequest to future generations and our contribution to the security of the wider world, with which we are ever more intimately bound up. What we do affects both the wider alliance to which we belong and the wider world debate about nuclear weapons and their proliferation, which is becoming more and more intense every day.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07012469000116"></a>I know there are those who argue that nuclear weapons are no defence against terrorism, which is where the deadly threat to our security comes from. It is undeniably a deadly threat. The world is flat not only in economic terms, as Thomas Friedman and others put it so well, but in terms of weapons and power, or is becoming so. Weapons technology today means that the smallest are now level with the mightiest, and that tiny groups with deadly material and deadly high-tech weapons can challenge the largest military forces and the mightiest weapons systems on earth.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1111"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07012469000117"></a>Even if nuclear weapons cannot meet that kind of threat, terrorists are, as the Minister rightly reminded us, helped and encouraged, sometimes on a proxy basis, by rogue states such as North Korea. They also have the opportunity to gain access to nuclear and fissile materials where other states, which may not be badly intentioned, are nevertheless lax in their control of these materials. The case of AQ Khan comes very much to mind in that context. So if we need a credible deterrent, which I believe we do, as part of the global discipline against either maniacal or negligent behaviour, what are our underlying reasons and aims behind that need and the decisions that are now being taken?</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07012469000118"></a>First, obviously, we want to see world peace; secondly, we want to see our own nation&#146;s security in as far as it can be separated from the global security network, which nowadays is less and less; thirdly, we have to halt further proliferations and wind down the systems of existing nuclear states to a minimum in accordance with the aims of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty; and fourthly, we have to maintain constant pressure for armament reduction of all sorts, which can only be multilateral. There are those who want unilateral action. Some idealists believe that it would set an example to aspiring nuclear states. I believe that it would do no such thing. On the contrary, it would present new targets, new incentives and new opportunities for irresponsible actions.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07012469000119"></a>I referred to peace as an objective. We are now very far from that. All I can say is that at least no nukes have been let off in anger, not since Hiroshima. It is plain that deterrence at the nuclear level works and people cite the developments between Pakistan and India as an example. It is in our direct national interest to ensure that mutual deterrence continues to work because as I said earlier the aim must be to prevent the weapons ever being used. Any use of any nuclear weapon anywhere in the world would today freeze up the open international system immediately, which is more and more integrated thanks to the information revolution. It would threaten the globe&#146;s highly integrated energy and material supplies and paralyse world economies and investment. That is our national security in the widest but nevertheless the most realistic sense in today&#146;s world.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07012469000120"></a>As for our national security in the more narrow sense of protecting these islands, the truth is that for almost every nation nowadays a nuclear attack on one is a nuclear attack on all. The idea that as an existing, recognised nuclear power we can step out of the increasingly integrated world security system by unilateral action would be like stepping clumsily out of a small boat. It could keel over by the act of our stepping out of it. The NPT, with its acceptance of five existing nuclear states and the comprehensive regime of monitoring to deter all others, is just that small boat and it is nearly under water while we are standing here. It clearly needs straightening and tightening up.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07012469000121"></a>I recently visited the IAEA in Vienna. Mr Baradei and his expert colleagues there have been giving enormous thought to a strategy for strengthening and renewing the NPT rather than letting it be submerged  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by careless, irresponsible or even well intentioned actions. The IAEA believes that, first, all existing nuclear weapons and material must be locked up totally and completely. There must be no loose nukes, as its members put it. That requires more intense international co-operation than ever before. If I may say so, it is good that our Department of Trade and Industry officials in the DTI&#146;s international nuclear policy and programme department are playing a key part in helping Russia, for one, which is probably the most important country in that respect, to do that and to ensure that fissile material is locked up.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07012469000122"></a>Secondly, there must be no new uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities. We must continue to use a complex combination of sticks and carrots to stop Iran going this way. Iran can be helped with civil nuclear power. Some people ask why Iran needs it when it has all that oil, but it is an incredible fact that Iran is at this moment importing oil, such a mess has it made of its own economy. Iran must not be permitted to flout either the existing NPT regime or a better one that can be devised. If it is so permitted, beyond that lies cataclysm, massive proliferation and disaster.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07012469000123"></a>Thirdly, there must be no new nuclear states. North Korea is the immediate danger. Perhaps it is not said often enough, but we all know that China holds the cards. China is capable of holding the whip hand and of halting North Korean plans if it wants to. It is through talking to China and bringing it to the point where it sees the acute danger to itself that the path to a solution will be found.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07012469000124"></a>Fourthly, there must be a true global alliance against nuclear terrorism and the terrorist procurement of nuclear materials. Fifthly, as the IAEA suggests, we want to work towards an independent system of guarantees, supplying all states with the nuclear fuel they will increasingly need as peaceful, low-carbon civil nuclear power expands enormously, which it will. Whether some people have doubts or not, it is almost certain that that will happen.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07012469000125"></a>This is the background against which our decision is made today. It points to continual leverage and the use of the position which history has shaped for us as a recognised nuclear power, which means retaining a reduced and minimalised deterrent, as the Minister described it, to help us work towards these objectives in an intensely dangerous international environment. To abandon that capability by decisions or non-decisions now to let the whole system run down would leave us uninsured, unprotected against grim possibilities and uninfluential in curbing proliferation of nuclear weapons across the planet. That is not a legacy which anyone would care to leave to their children.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1113"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee responded by undertaking a series of inquiries, while sharply criticising the Ministry of Defence for its reluctance to co-operate by providing the information needed for a proper and open debate. The Liberal Democrats set up a working group, which will report to our spring conference in March, and which has taken evidence from independent experts on defence and foreign policy.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07012469000127"></a>Meanwhile, the Government appear to be doing their best to close down the debate that they have opened. The hasty publication of this brief White Paper in mid-December compounded earlier rumours that a much longer and much more detailed White Paper would be published in the new year, which suggests a degree of confusion in the Government. The paper argues that we need to take crucial decisions now because a lead-in time of 17 years or more is needed before the successor system comes into service, and because the Trident system will cease to be fit for service 25 years after its introduction.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07012469000128"></a>In his opening speech, the Minister appeared to be retreating a little. He said only that some decisions had to be taken now. We do not accept either of those assumptions. We accept that it is prudent in the current uncertain circumstances to invest in preparatory studies for a successor system. But the crucial decisions on this weapon system, as on others taken through the research and development stages, will come when keels have to be laid and major costs incurred, which the Government claim will be in five to seven years&#146; time. We argue that, with life extension of the current submarine system, it can be much later.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07012469000129"></a>My noble friend Lord Garden, whose career has included direct engagement in the UK&#146;s deterrent force and, later, responsibility for defence strategic planning, will expand on how and why the Trident system was planned for a longer operational life and is likely to remain operationally effective for considerably longer than the Government now suggest. My noble friend Lady Williams will say more about the important non-proliferation and arms control dimensions of decisions to maintain, reduce and, at some point, decide whether to renew.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07012469000130"></a>We have to ask, therefore, why the Prime Minister is determined to press for this artificial decision, with an artificial timescale, now. Indeed, in a later chapter, the White Paper says only that,</p>
<ul><a name="07012469000198"></a>&#147;we plan shortly to commence detailed concept work&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012469000192"></a>with the intention of placing a,</p>
<ul><a name="07012469000200"></a>&#147;contract for their detailed design by around 2012 to 2014&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07012469000193"></a>when more accurate cost estimates will be available. The major commitments on spending are still on the other side of two general elections from now. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister wants to make this part of his legacy, to commit his party to a major, long-term programme before he leaves office.</p>

<p><a name="07012469000195"></a>The way in which the initial call for debate was made suggested to some of us that Blair and Brown wanted to flush out old Labour opponents of the new Labour legacy, perhaps to provoke a contest for the succession in which they might be roundly defeated, seeking to use the nuclear issue to mark a symbolic divide within the Labour Party, in much the same way  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1114"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as the noble Lord, Lord Owen, sought to use the deterrent to divide Social Democrats from Liberals some 20 years ago.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07012469000131"></a>Then there was the question of the needs of BAE Systems, a company much favoured by Mr Blair&#146;s Government, with its specialists pleading that commitments are needed now to maintain specialist submarine-building skills in Britain by maintaining a long-term order book in Barrow-in-Furness. We insist that there is enough time for an informed public debate, and it is not necessary&#151;at least it is not possible&#151;to reach an irrevocable decision now, before our current Prime Minister leaves office.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07012469000132"></a>It is also desirable to promote the widest possible consensus across the parties on such a major investment, linked to the long-term security of the United Kingdom. Yet, this debate has started at  the wrong end, with the weapons system, not with the foreign policy objectives it is intended to serve or the potential threats from which it may protect us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07012469000133"></a>Fifty years ago, when in the wake of the Suez debacle and the forced retreat from empire, the crucial decisions were taken to commit Britain to maintain its own nuclear deterrent, even at the cost of strategic dependence on the United States, the strongest argument advanced was one of status. Britain&#146;s Conservative Government were determined to maintain our claim as a major world power, in spite of increasing difficulties in affording a weapons system that justified that claim.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07012469000134"></a>Harold Wilson&#146;s Labour Government from 1964 accepted that world-power status remained essential for Britain. Apart from the nuclear deterrent, you will recall how he clung to the post-imperial dream of maintaining British forces east of Suez, until an exchange rate crisis forced withdrawal. One of his defence Ministers, Christopher Mayhew, had by then resigned and joined the Liberals in protest at that absurd and wasteful obsession with global power and international status.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07012469000135"></a>Without exception, all the experts who gave evidence to the Liberal Democrat working group dismissed the argument that Britain needs to maintain a nuclear deterrent in order to remain a great power with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Sir Michael Quinlan was explicit in dismissing this argument in his <I>International Affairs</I> article last year. In the Prime Minister&#146;s Plymouth speech, 10 days ago, there were disturbing echoes of a foreign policy based on &#147;walking tall&#148; and &#147;punching above our weight&#148;. I hope that we can all agree here that British defence spending should in no way be based on status or on weapons systems procured as a badge of status; British defence should serve the objectives of British foreign policy.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07012469000136"></a>This Government lack a coherent foreign policy, however. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, persuasively argued in the debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech that new Labour&#146;s foreign policy had collapsed in the aftermath of the Iraq adventure. The Prime Minister has tested the US/UK special relationship to destruction, demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that dependence on Washington does not bring additional influence in Washington.

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07012469000137"></a>The first question in considering how vital procurement of a successor deterrent system is for Britain is whether we see this country&#146;s long-term foreign policy as bound up with the projection of American power, as part of a multilateral European approach to global order, as standing alone in splendid isolation, or, like Switzerland, in non-combatant neutrality. I take it that no serious politician outside the ranks of the UK Independence Party foresees Britain&#146;s future as one of splendid isolation. The question is whether our security, foreign policy and defence contribution will be made more within the transatlantic framework or the European one.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07012469000138"></a>The Prime Minister&#146;s Plymouth speech committed Britain to maintaining a close and necessarily dependent relationship with the United States. If Britain is to remain the loyal supporter of US policy wherever that may take us, most of all in managing the intricate politics of the Middle East and the Muslim world, it is arguable that we do not need our own deterrent. American nuclear weapons are capable enough to protect us. I suspect that for some the argument for renewal rests on the fear that the American umbrella may not be sufficiently reliable, however loyally we follow its lead, and that Britain, far closer to the Middle East than the continental United States, is an easier target for a radical anti-western state. For American neo-conservatives and their Europhobe British supporters, Britain is &#147;Airstrip One&#148; of the American empire, facing a continent sliding into becoming &#147;Eurabia&#148; as it succumbs to the Muslim threat. I note that one of the leading proponents of the &#147;Eurabia&#148; thesis has been invited by Edward Leigh MP to speak shortly to an all-party group in the Palace of Westminster.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07012469000139"></a>In contrast, the Prime Minister&#146;s Plymouth speech scarcely mentioned the European dimension to British foreign policy and defence in spite of the common approach that Britain, Germany and France have correctly taken towards Iran, in spite of our shared assumptions about the Middle East peace process, and in spite of the considerable contribution made by Britain towards European defence co-operation. It is common ground among many long-term defence planners that we can afford to maintain the capacity to project conventional forces beyond our region only through closer integration with our European neighbours. There is a contradiction between repeated admissions that Britain is unlikely ever again to be engaged in serious military operations without close co-operation with European or north American partners and continued silence on how an independent British nuclear deterrent fits in to such a pattern of ever closer collaboration.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para32"></a>

One of the issues we need to explore in the public debate which the Prime Minister has now launched and is now trying to pre-empt is how far long-term dependence on the United States for our deterrent system carries with it political dependence; that is to say, reluctance to disagree with American policy, even when it cuts across British interests, for fear of US pressure on nuclear resupply and intelligence co-operation.</p>

<a name="70124-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07012469000141"></a>The risk of nuclear proliferation spreading from Israel and Iran across the Middle East now appears high. That justifies for the present the maintenance of a minimum nuclear deterrent as an insurance against a crisis in that region spilling across the Mediterranean to western Europe. Our party&#146;s working group concluded that the cost of maintaining our current deterrent force was thus justifiable, that its operational life could be extended for a further five to 10 years at moderate cost, but that we could reduce both the number of boats and the number of warheads to three and 100 respectively, not only to contain costs but also to signal to other states that the British deterrent is a limited insurance against catastrophe, not a weapon for other purposes. Many noble Lords will have heard Richard Garwin of the US National Academy of Engineering on yesterday&#146;s Radio 4 &#147;Today&#148; programme arguing on his way to give evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee that the life of the Vanguard submarines could be extended by 15 years or more without major additional expenditure.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07012469000142"></a>Two questions remain for the extended public debate on which politicians of all parties should be embarking. First, what are the likely threats against which we need to insure; and secondly, how high will the insurance premium be, how large will be the cost of replacement and what are the opportunity costs of investing in nuclear weapons rather than conventional systems? A moment&#146;s reflection makes it clear that North Korean nuclear weapons, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, suggested, are unlikely to threaten Britain or western Europe, or that a British deterrent would add anything to Chinese, American or Russian systems in containing that rogue regime. But we all recognise the potential threats from oil-rich but stability-poor states across west Asia. It must be the highest priority of British foreign policy over the next five to 10 years, before crucial spending commitments have to be made on building a replacement deterrent system, to work with like-minded states to bring greater stability to the Middle East and thus avoid disorder from that region spilling over across Europe.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07012469000143"></a>The most depressing part of the Prime Minister&#146;s Plymouth speech was his complete espousal of the American neo-conservative interpretation of the nature of the conflict and his insistence that we are engaged in a long war with a coherent enemy rather than struggling with a disordered region built on weak states and a younger generation in revolt against American hegemony.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1117"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07012469000144"></a>Several of the experts who advised the Liberal Democrat working group spoke of an insurance premium as the correct analogy for a replacement nuclear deterrent. The calculation to be made involves a careful balance between the severity of the threat and the steepness of the cost. Procurement of three boats will moderate the cost to some extent; but, unless in the years that we gain through extending the life of the current Trident system, some alternative delivery system becomes available, the costs of replacement will threaten to squeeze conventional weapons systems out of the defence budget.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07012469000145"></a>The Prime Minister&#146;s answer in his Plymouth speech was simple: we must commit ourselves to a long-term increase, a further increase, in Britain&#146;s defence spending. But he will no longer be in office to make the case for the higher taxation or lower civil spending that such a commitment implies. The opportunity costs of Trident replacement may thus be severe and will be justified only by the severity of the then threat to Britain. The advice that we received was that a moderate insurance premium was justifiable but that a steep premium against an unlikely ultimate risk, at the expense of other British contributions to global stability, was difficult to justify.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07012469000146"></a>So let us open a wider debate on Britain&#146;s foreign policy and on the place of nuclear deterrence in that foreign policy. Let us not shut down discussion by appeals to Britain&#146;s post-imperial status or to our allegedly unique diplomatic wisdom and responsibilities. Britain does not stand alone as we face an insecure and unstable world. We need to discuss which partners we should work most closely with to meet which potential threats and what mix of deterrence and diplomacy will prove most useful in shaping our shared approach. The commitment to procure such a major weapons system should be taken only after such a debate.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07012469000148"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, the decision regarding the future of the United Kingdom&#146;s nuclear deterrent is a very serious matter. It requires the widest possible consultation, which is why we on the Bench of Bishops welcome the White Paper. I think that it is the first time that a British Government have initiated a public debate of this kind. Since the Attlee Government committed themselves to a nuclear programme, decisions about nuclear weapons have been taken by the Prime Minister, as the Minister indicated this afternoon, with perhaps some key Cabinet colleagues but probably not the full Cabinet.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07012469000149"></a>That and much else in the White Paper is welcome. It is right to confine its arguments for the retention of a nuclear capability solely to the case for deterring nuclear threats and to resist the temptation to broaden its use to counter threats such as chemical and biological weapons. Also welcome are the proposed reductions in the stockpile of the United Kingdom&#146;s nuclear arsenal. These, and a readiness to  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reduce the number of submarines necessary to maintain this deterrent capability, underline the United Kingdom&#146;s track record in progressively reducing its capability in line with its international obligations under the non-proliferation treaty. I also agree that the question of what constitutes a reasonable insurance policy in a dangerous and uncertain world is important and difficult. It is right that Governments should err on the side of caution.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07012469000150"></a>No one would disagree that it is a fundamental responsibility of any Government to provide for the security of the United Kingdom and its citizens, now and for the future, against both real and potential threats, including nuclear aggression and blackmail. Security is the good that makes possible other goods, and the defence of the United Kingdom remains the first duty of the Government. Yet as other noble Lords have noted, since nuclear weapons belong by virtue of their terrifying power in a different category to any other weapon system, it is important to ask what kind of security they offer us, and in what circumstances, if any, their use or threat of use can be ethically justified.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07012469000151"></a>It is that concern that I feel is insufficiently addressed by the White Paper. In paragraph 3.4, to which the Minister made oblique reference, the White Paper reasons:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07012469000199"></a>&#147;We deliberately maintain ambiguity about precisely when, how and at what scale we would contemplate use of our nuclear deterrent. We will not simplify the calculations of a potential aggressor by defining more precisely the circumstances in which we might consider the use of our nuclear capabilities. Hence, we will not rule in or out the first use of nuclear weapons&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012469000196"></a>Of course, there is merit in keeping potential enemies guessing. Nevertheless, given the grave ethical issues involved with any use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, it is legitimate to ask in what sorts of circumstances their use might be justified and proportionate in terms of the just war doctrine. The White Paper gives inadequate treatment of that legitimate question, which I believe must be asked if the public debate is to be meaningful.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07012469000152"></a>Fear that making this information publicly available would somehow reduce the credibility of the United Kingdom&#146;s deterrent is, in my view and that of others on the Bench of Bishops, overstated. Such reticence might have been excusable and understandable at the height of the Cold War, but I question its acceptability in today&#146;s circumstances. The position of the Government is not necessarily shared by other comparably sized nuclear powers. President Chirac, for example, seems ready to discuss these issues more openly. The modernisation and adaptation of the French nuclear arsenal to strike at a potential aggressor&#146;s political, economic and military power centres in a comparatively discriminate way marks a significant departure from the anti-cities strategy of the Cold War days. It is disappointing that a similar shift in strategy, and a move towards greater public transparency, is not reflected in this White Paper.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07012469000153"></a>Central to the concern that I and other right reverend Prelates have is whether we can be assured that the war plan for Trident and any successor will be  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1119"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>based only and wholly on an explicit counter-combatant targeting strategy, holding at risk military and related assets and keeping non-combatant casualties to a proportionate minimum. For us, that is a crucial question in the context of the ethical arguments against nuclear weapons, which are strikingly omitted from the interesting box 3.1, which sets out the Government&#146;s response to various counter-arguments. Since that is probably the most widely held objection to nuclear deterrents, I find the omission very curious. Addressing this ethical concern would not require the Government to disclose details of targeting plans or precise details of the envisaged circumstances of use. All it would require is for the Government to indicate their overall strategy, including the parameters for the weapons&#146; use and the limits within which any targeting policy would be set. That would enable the Government to explain how their use would be consistent with the United Kingdom&#146;s obligations in international law, as well as with ethical principles, particularly the just war requirements that any use of weapons should be proportionate to the objective to be achieved, and discriminate in order to minimise non-combatant casualties.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07012469000154"></a>The Government&#146;s reluctance to engage in such discussions leaves it vulnerable to the charge&#151;from those opposed to a nuclear deterrent&#151;that the use, or very possession, of nuclear weapons is immoral and somehow coarsens the moral fabric of the nation. If the Government are unwilling to say anything further about the terms under which they might use their deterrent, how are Parliament and the wider public meant to evaluate the efficacy and utility of such an instrument, even assuming that they are prepared to accept the principle of nuclear deterrence?</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07012469000155"></a>As I have already said, the Government are to be congratulated on publishing this White Paper. For any debate to be meaningful, the Government need to provide additional information regarding their war plans for Trident. It is important to remember that the credibility of the national deterrence strategy depends to a significant extent on public backing, since an assessment of that will play into the calculations of potential aggressors.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07012469000156"></a>We on this Bench want to avoid being drawn into some of the party-political issues touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, for example. We are aware of the complexity of the profound issues underlying this debate. Our concern is that amid the proper arguments already shaping the contributions of noble Lords, the hugely important ethical concerns continue to be explored rigorously in this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07012469000158"></a>The Liberal Benches say that there is an element of surprise in our being bounced into this. In 2005, for the first time in 30 years, I was not a parliamentary candidate. I therefore had the opportunity to read the Labour manifesto, something I usually tried to avoid doing until after the election, when I had to defend it or continue to try to change it. Significantly, the manifesto said&#151;quite clearly and without question&#151;that we would maintain the deterrent. The implication was that we would take whatever action was necessary to sustain that maintenance. I say this for several reasons. When I first stood for Parliament in 1974 and 1979, I did so as a unilateralist fighting on a multilateralist manifesto. I only answered questions on the subject and did not, at that time, proclaim very much because, by and large, people were not interested.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07012469000159"></a>In the elections of 1983 and 1987, when my views coincided with those of the manifesto, I had&#151;in the first of those elections, at least&#151;the experience of getting helpful suggestions from my constituents on their doorsteps. In 1987 we anticipated some of the problems and went through the kind of somersaults and political gymnastics that we have seen from the Liberal Benches today. We committed ourselves to roughly the same defence budget but were going to spend it on conventional weapons. We would perhaps try to appease the defence constituencies by having a defence diversification agency. We would nevertheless be able to argue that we could turn swords into ploughshares; that there would be a world agreement that, somehow, everyone else would follow a British gesture.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07012469000160"></a>Nearly all these points fell on deaf ears for the British electorate. I have the scars of visits to Barrow, Devonport and Rosyth, where I was greeted as a friend who was misguided on the main issue; a number of my constituents worked there at the time. It was a somewhat chastening experience when we went through the public opinion poll post-election analysis and discovered how difficult the issue was. The public were quite happy with a nuclear deterrent and felt comfortable with it. Despite the general approval I received espousing a unilateralist manifesto at Labour Party meetings across the country, it was not reciprocated by the rest of the British body politic when I got out into the world in general.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07012469000161"></a>When my noble friends Lord Kinnock and Lord Clarke of Hampstead, who is not in his place today, and Gerald Kaufman and I started visiting the decision-making centres of the other nuclear powers&#151;Washington, Paris and Moscow&#151;and spoke to the Chinese in London, we were startled by the indifference with which they greeted our willingness to give up our nuclear arsenal. They felt that it would not be a bad thing, but would make not one whit of difference to their nuclear capability or willingness to participate in disarmament negotiations one way or the other.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07012469000162"></a>It could be argued that 1987-88 marked the emergence of new Labour on foreign and security policy. We began to see how we could put together the kind of policies mentioned today by the noble Lord,

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07012469000163"></a>Some argue that the US providing certain elements of our nuclear deterrent somehow prejudices its independence. It would be difficult for any member of NATO to have any independence in any of its defence commitments or capabilities if it sought to do so only with nationally produced military equipment. The Americans provide important parts of our deterrent, but the manner in which we deploy and threaten to use it&#151;if that is the correct expression&#151;is in no way prejudiced by our relationship with the Americans. Indeed, I remember talking to the Soviets in Moscow about this, and they said, &#147;Well, we know that you are far closer than the French to the Americans. We know that you walk roughly in step with the Americans, but we can never be sure that you would choose to use your weapons in concert with them or that they would have the power of veto over what you wished to do with these weapons&#148;. This is the heart of the British deterrent strategy&#151;the doctrine of uncertainty, which says that it is up to our potential threateners to work out what we would or would not do with our weapons.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07012469000164"></a>Equally important is the fact that we have a weapons system which is damn near undetectable. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, made the point that it might be difficult in certain circumstances with only three boats, if all of them were in base at the one time, to know whether or not we had a capability. As someone who has always been supportive of the three-boat concept&#151;and the noble Lord spoke about advances in technology&#151;I think the ease of maintenance is that much greater now that we probably would be able to have such a system without creating the problem that he suggested.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07012469000165"></a>The point I am really getting at here is that of the virtual invulnerability of the British nuclear deterrent; the fact that it cannot be detected; the fact that it can be anywhere in the world and can fire at anywhere in the world. If we are to talk about a weapons system which is flexible&#151;we are not going to the old sub-strategic arguments, and the Minister eschewed the concept of sub-strategic weapons today, quite correctly in my view&#151;what we have to recognise is that we need to be able to deploy the new boats with only a limited number of warheads, perhaps only one, and that we would need to have a sufficiency of decoys.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07012469000166"></a>This is where the debate has to be conducted in public, so that people get an idea of what nuclear strategy is about. I am not asking this evening for a clear and explicit commitment that we will have at least 11 decoys on at least one of the rockets, but this is something which ought to come out in the debate. I know there is a natural reticence in the MoD for talking in public in an adult way to people it does not always regard as adults, but we have to be given the benefit of the doubt. I notice the Minister is looking

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07012469000167"></a>That is not to say that this process is not an exciting one. Politically, we have an opportunity. In the 1970s when people who might be speaking today were members of Cabinet, decisions were, as far as one can understand, at least hinted at in Cabinet. Preparatory work was done before 1980, before the Conservatives committed themselves to the Trident programme in the fullest sense. We did start very early on. That is significant and should be put on the record to clear up some of the nonsense spoken by the Liberals as far as the Blair-Brown thing is concerned. It was in fact the Chancellor who gave a commitment post the election, in advance of the Prime Minister making the point. I see the Minister is nodding and I am grateful for his concession on that point.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07012469000168"></a>What I want to say in closing is this: we have an opportunity here to secure a minimal deterrence which is nevertheless credible and would enable us as a country to continue to play a sensible part in trying to deal with the rogue states, as members of the permanent five and others have. It will enable us at the same time to work with our long-standing ally the United States, but equally importantly it will give us the opportunity within the European Union to work with France on those areas of non-proliferation or rogue-state limitation in which the European Union has been doing a lot of good work. We know that there is the economic strength of the federal republic, but when that is joined with the United Kingdom and France in dealing with nuclear rogue states, there is a possibility for fresh European thinking. I believe that we can argue a bit&#151;and only a bit&#151;about timescales and about how long we can extend the life.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07012469000169"></a>The Radio 4 interview yesterday morning was very interesting but what the Minister said was equally interesting. He pointed out that the US systems are somewhat different from our own and that life extension may not be exactly the same. We need a great deal more information and it would be helpful if the MoD could be sufficiently forthcoming to the Defence Select Committee in the Commons to allow, if not that committee, at least the rest of us to make a judgment when we see it.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07012469000170"></a>The Government have made a good start. The White Paper and the speeches today have shown a breadth of vision, a degree of commitment and a willingness to listen and to debate. This is the start of a lengthy process and I am very grateful to the Minister for the constructive way in which he has introduced the debate.</p>

Primarily, the noble Lord seemed to be saying that, on almost every occasion on which a

I am not clear whether it follows that the decisions are wrong. Others will speak from the Liberal Benches, so perhaps by the end of the debate we shall have a clearer idea of their position.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07012469000172"></a>I have always been an unashamed supporter of nuclear weapons. Anyone who has looked at what they can or could do will see the point of them. Recently, I came across one of the most interesting collateral notes to history when reading the diaries of Sir Alan Lascelles, who had been the private secretary to King George VI. Many months before the end of the war, Sir Edward Appleton, later a British Nobel laureate, went to brief the King on the progress of the atomic bomb. He said that the bomb was not likely to be ready in time to be used against the Germans but probably would be ready to use against the Japanese. He was asked whether that would have a great effect. His reply was, as quoted by Sir Alan Lascelles, that,</p>
<ul><a name="07012469000201"></a>&#147;a couple of those on Japan and the war would be over within days: no doubt about that&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70124-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07012469000173"></a>It has always been apparent what a devastating and total weapon a nuclear weapon is. Its capability to keep the peace, once used and demonstrated in that way, was proved over the 50 years of the Cold War. That was a period when, very rightly, the West decided to contain rather than confront Soviet communism. Of course, that policy of containment was originally laid down by George Kennan in his famous long telegram of March 1946, which was sent to the American State Department. It set the tone for policy on the Soviet Union thereafter.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07012469000174"></a>We have an independent, state-of-the-art nuclear weapons system. I totally accept what the Minister said&#151;it ties in with research that I have done&#151;that it is genuinely and totally independent. That means that we can use it, no one can stop us using it, and no one can make us use it. If we were to give it up, it is quite certain that we would never get it back. The costs would be too great and the decision would be too big.</p>

<a name="70124-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07012469000175"></a>We do not really know what the threats to peace are likely to be; we cannot begin to tell what will unravel over the period in which this decision-making framework is set out in the White Paper; therefore, it would be most unwise to assume that the need for such weapons could vanish. Like the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, I am very interested in the Prime Minister's speech at Plymouth on 12 January. I shall quote one part of it, where he speaks of Islamic fundamentalism,</p>
<ul><a name="07012469000202"></a>&#147;what we were and are confronted with is of a far more fundamental character than we supposed ... We face something more akin to revolutionary communism in its early and most militant phase. It is global ... It has states or at least parts of the governing apparatus of states that give it succour&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012469000197"></a>That is just one example of the dimension of the unforeseen threats around the world. Incidentally, there is a lesson to be learnt from the Cold War period on dealing with international terrorism because probably the key word should again be &#147;containment&#148; rather than &#147;confrontation&#148;.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07012469000176"></a>The crucial thing about a nuclear weapon is that it has to go off when and where it is wanted and not otherwise. I am fairly doubtful about whether the newcomers to nuclear-weapons capability have weapons that remotely compare in quality, reliability and certainty, let along in invulnerability, with those of countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Russia and, probably, China. At the time of maximum tension between India and Pakistan, it was rumoured that had the politicians of either country invited their generals to use the weapons, they would have declined to do so.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07012469000177"></a>The question we have to ask is; what are we going to do about these submarines? As I understand it, the contention in the White Paper and in what the Minister said is not that the submarines are technologically obsolete&#151;they are still state of the art, invulnerable, unfindable and fully effective&#151;but that they are likely to become physically worn out. Therefore, I wonder whether we need to spend a great deal of money on a new design of submarine. I know that there are questions about it, and many Members of this House heard the &#147;Today&#148; programme yesterday. The question is whether we can modify, repair or replace certain components in the Vanguard submarines. That is one way forward, and I hope that in due course we can hear more about that, although the Minister said that that had been discounted.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07012469000178"></a>One of the problems that has always caused over-run on major military expenditure projects is that the spec has constantly been changed and updated. Indeed, one of the reasons why Poseidon and Trident stuck pretty closely to their original budgets was that we were buying off-the-shelf things from the Americans. We knew exactly where we were. I hope that the Government are, among other things, considering building two, three, four&#151;or whatever number may be correct&#151;new Vanguard submarines, which we know how to build and that could by definition be used for a further 25 or 30 years. That could have a significant impact on the cost.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07012469000179"></a>I suppose the cost factor concerns us most. The cost of our nuclear deterrent is approximately 4 per cent of our defence budget, which is about 2.5 per cent of our GDP. My worry is always&#151;this is not  a great criticism of the Government&#151;that Governments are very inclined to undertake military commitments and then find that the cost of those commitments is greater than the resources they have available, either the equipment they have ready to use or the opportunity cost of the equipment they will need. Last week, we discussed the problem that is possibly looming of the cost of the two new aircraft carriers. We have two or three alternatives on military expenditure: we spend more of our GDP&#151;that has its own problems, but it is a possibility&#151;alternatively, we undertake less in the way of military commitments; or we invite others to share in the cost of military endeavours that we undertake, which are for the benefit of the world as a whole. The latter possibility is one which I would like to see explored much further. In that regard it is particularly notable that, when we spent some &#163;2.5 billion on the first Gulf War, we got back &#163;2 billion from others for whom it   


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was an advantage that we undertook the war. So far, on Iraq, we have spent some &#163;4 billion and we are not likely to get any of it back. I ask the Government to think of the renewal of this weapons system in the context of some of those issues.</p>

It is nearly 50 years since I attended the meeting at Central Hall, Westminster, on 17 February 1958, that effectively launched the campaign for nuclear disarmament. The distinguished platform included Bertrand Russell,  JB Priestly, AJP Taylor and Alan Taylor, my former history tutor, who was in coruscating rhetorical form.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07012469000181"></a>The audience was ecstatic, but I moved from agnosticism to the reluctant acceptance of nuclear weapons, upset by the militant unilateral campaigners and, more important, the clear threat from the Soviet Union to Britain&#146;s security and freedom. I never accepted the aphorism that it was &#147;Better red than dead&#148;.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07012469000182"></a>Almost a whole generation later, in July 1980, I replied in the House of Commons as shadow Secretary of State for Defence to the Conservative Government&#146;s Statement that they intended to replace the existing Polaris nuclear deterrent with Trident. In a cautious response, I said that the Government's case had not been made but that I did not object to the principle. Many angry Labour Back-Benchers were not pleased, saying that they were in &#147;utter despair&#148; and that it was a &#147;disgrace&#148;. Shortly afterwards I was removed from my role in a Labour Party&#146;s television programme and replaced by Robin Cook, the then acceptable voice of unilateral disarmament; in due course I was sacked from defence by the Labour leader. How times have changed.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07012469000183"></a>To complete the picture and to avoid misleading, I should point out that in the 1980s there were shifting opinions within my Social Democratic Party and between the SDP and the Liberals. We should not be surprised that bitter arguments over awesome nuclear weapons have continued for so long. Decisions involve acute ethical, financial, social and technological issues and changing international circumstances and threats. In high politics, taking risks over matters of life and death raises very difficult questions of judgment. But, in reflecting over half a century, I welcome the White Paper as it sets out plainly enough the areas of choice. In my view, if we are to have another generation of nuclear deterrents, the best prospect is a modestly updated Trident D5 missile system resting on a new class of submarines.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07012469000184"></a>As Britain is a small island, a nuclear deterrent is less exposed and vulnerable under water than on land or in the air. It is also better to build from the experience of Trident and draw on the United States&#146; facilities than to choose cruise missiles, although submarine-launched weapons may have been a serious alternative once upon a time.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1126"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07012469000185"></a>We cannot safely forecast the cost of the new boats, given our mixed financial record in dealing with complex weapons systems, but the procurement of Polaris and Trident was broadly within budget. Thus cost should be manageable despite the opportunity cost, including new claims within the budget, Britain having chosen to maintain its extended international frontiers. I hope that there will be only three boats rather than four, and fewer warheads, but I am not competent to weigh those arguments.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07012469000186"></a>The central question, prior to the merits of alternative nuclear systems, is whether Britain should retain a nuclear deterrent at all when the Vanguard-class submarines begin to leave service in the 2020s or possibly beyond. We cannot say with confidence whether Britain would have moved from wartime research to the procurement of its own nuclear weapons had there been no Cold War, but from the 1950s until the Berlin Wall came down, Britain&#146;s case for nuclear weapons rested on the dangers from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. It follows that, from the early 1990s, it seemed that there might be no need for a new generation of weapons.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07012469000187"></a>The paradox is that we have moved from a bipolar balance of nuclear power&#151;and, I agree, of terror&#151;that was carefully calculated and relatively stable after the Cuban missile crisis, despite those new tensions over the deploying of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe in the 1980s, to a twilight zone in which so much more is unpredictable. The White Paper refers to the ambitions of North Korea and Iran, but not to the long-term future of China or the flexible muscles of Russia, with Putin and his successors. Today&#146;s terrorism, with which we are preoccupied, can be consolidated into maverick or rogue states with nuclear weapons as more than status symbols.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07012469000188"></a>I share the White Paper&#146;s view that no one, hand on heart, can wholly discount the possibility of a major threat to Britain through our grandchildren&#146;s lives. Despite recent foreboding, we may some time find ourselves living through the sunny uplands of unprecedented peace. But, taking the most optimistic view, the ultimate risk&#151;and the danger to Britain&#151;would remain. I recognise and respect all those who have long been opposed to nuclear weapons on ethical grounds, at every time and in every place. Yet I am not persuaded that, if nuclear weapons were, reluctantly, acceptable in the Cold War, they cannot be morally acceptable, sadly and reluctantly, in the years ahead.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07012469000189"></a>There is a serious argument&#151;to adapt the memorable phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Hurd&#151;that it is now time for Britain to punch below its weight. A post-Iraq parallel would be the ending of Britain&#146;s imperial role following the Suez debacle, but even if Britain were to choose to shrink its international frontiers there would still be the need to protect the homeland from external threats.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07012469000190"></a>I share the view that there is no need for the Government to make a final decision on Trident now or for several years. There is time not only for a full and extended debate but, given the operational gap before the existing submarines are phased out, to  wait for a decision after the next election. However,   


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1127"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I assume that the Prime Minister and his putative successor would like to tidy up the loose ends before he moves on, whether we like that or not.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07012469000191"></a>Given the publication of the White Paper and a debate in both Houses, the momentum of opinion towards an early decision will gather. On such vital, critical security matters, the public may soon want to know exactly where policy-makers stand. I would like to believe that, in the gap, an unexpected successful international initiative on arms control and multilateral disarmament will justify having second thoughts on the thrust of the White Paper, but we should not deceive ourselves about the likelihood of that.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07012477000002"></a>The issue before us is summed up in the words of the White Paper:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07012477000025"></a>&#147;The investment required to maintain&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012477000022"></a>our deterrent,</p>
<ul><a name="07012477000027"></a>&#147;will not come at the expense of the conventional capabilities that our armed forces need&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012477000023"></a>Were that to be true, I would find it much easier to be enthusiastic in support of the White Paper, but all experience shows that that is not true.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07012477000003"></a>I remember that in 1968, when I had a small responsibility for the Royal Navy, it was genuinely believed by the admirals that the Polaris programme was outwith the rest of the defence budget and that the naval budget and capabilities would be judged quite separately. That was wrong then and it has been wrong ever since. Let us be clear: that statement is historically incorrect and it is very unlikely to be true in future.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07012477000004"></a>I then looked at what is the Royal Navy at present. In 1968, we had our first Polaris boat going out on patrol. We could claim, broadly, 200 naval ships; we had a substantial Navy. In 1980, Royal Navy personnel numbered 75,000. There were 8,000 to 10,000 Marines and a hundred capital ships. What is it today? There are roughly 33,000 Royal Naval personnel, 6,000 Royal Marines and 35 major ships. The Royal Navy is very close to lacking all-round capability and capacity.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07012477000005"></a>We have to face that. If we are really to make this decision as early as it is being asked for, it must coincide with the public expenditure review for 2007, not come before it. It needs to be taken into account in what we are going to do about, for example, the two carriers that have been consistently promised. It needs to be taken into account against the other service budgets. The Navy cannot be considered in isolation. Many naval personnel are involved in Afghanistan at the moment, if we consider the Royal Marines and others.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07012477000006"></a>All of us are in a way responsible for the fact that we have not kept the covenant with the Armed Forces. I must say that I object to the business of using naval ships as a background for political speeches. We have not done that in this country before; we have always  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1128"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>kept that sort of thing to when we are actually operational abroad. It appears that the Prime Minister, after 10 years, accepts that he has not lived up to that covenant. If so, that is a very welcome change, but let actions speak louder than words and let us now look at the budget.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07012477000007"></a>Do we really accept in this House that we do not have enough Chinooks in Afghanistan and that, as a consequence, some of our soldiers die? Do we really accept the story about armaments, body armour, and so on? We can all argue about the aim&#151;there is no question that anyone intended the situation&#151;but it worked out so that many people believe that we were not putting basic resources into that fairly minor item of expenditure.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07012477000008"></a>We also need to look at many other aspects. I start with the belief that the defence budget at the moment is seriously inadequate. I am therefore being asked to take on a new commitment. I make absolutely no secret of my belief, and never have, that a ballistic weapons system is the best form of deterrent, provided that the warheads are sophisticated enough to be able to penetrate ABM defences. At least I have a track record on this. I argued in 1977, 1978 and 1979 that we had to be very careful before we committed ourselves to a belief that a deterrent was credible only if it could penetrate ABM defences, because I genuinely believed then, and events have subsequently borne this out in spades, that we in this country did not have the capability to keep ahead of the complicated and sophisticated changes in ABM defences.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07012477000009"></a>Just look what happened to the Chevaline programme, which started in effect under Harold Wilson&#146;s Labour Government in 1967-68 as the Antelope programme. It became the Super Antelope programme, and then became the Chevaline programme. In 1972, which was probably the first time you could reasonably estimate its costs, it was going to cost &#163;175 million. It ended up costing more than &#163;1 billion&#151;the cost escalated year by year; I could read the figures to the House&#151;which is also a staggering increase in real terms.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07012477000010"></a>The House of Commons Select Committee report of 2006-07 on the provisions for nuclear submarines quite sensibly looked at all aspects, including asking whether there was sufficient capacity to build and maintain them and whether Rolls-Royce had the nuclear capacity. It was an extremely good report. I came across this little statement on the Select Committee&#146;s visit to Aldermaston and seeing the A91 building, the integrated radioactive liquid effluent treatment plant, which was completed but never used&#151;a loss of expenditure of &#163;147 million. I simply thought to myself that that was another sign that the programme, which is now a different Chevaline programme or whatever equivalent, demonstrates yet again our incapacity to contain our costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07012477000011"></a>On the basis of the argument as we currently see it, I reluctantly understand why the Government have taken the decision that they have. Certainly, the decision to participate in the Trident D5 life-extension programme, at a cost of some &#163;250 million, is prudent, and keeps the options open. However, the

I believe that, in our economic situation, we must consider dual use for almost everything. The section on cruise missiles is one paragraph, with an absurd statement that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07012477000026"></a>&#147;Any programme to develop and manufacture a new cruise missile would cost far more than retaining the Trident D5 missile&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012477000024"></a>What does that mean? Does it mean that Britain will develop a cruise missile by itself? We have never yet done so; we have very sensibly bought from the Americans. Are we then saying that the Americans will not make any changes to their cruise missiles? Why are they spending as much money as they are on hypersonic technology? It is perfectly possible that we may see a cruise missile of greater sophistication and perhaps particularly of greater speed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07012477000012"></a>I happened to be in Belgrade a few years ago. I drove down the street and saw the Ministry of Defence, in which, for my sins, I had to spend some time in 1992-93 talking to the then Serbian military. The whole place had been completely destroyed. The buildings on either side were completely intact. I went further down the same street and saw the same thing with the Ministry of the Interior. I remember our Ministry of Defence telling me in 1978 that cruise missiles were inaccurate and unproven technology, and that was why the MoD could not make any commitment to it. Let us at least admit when we have made a mistake. The arguments have not been truthfully used under successive Governments, in part because of far too much secrecy. The present Government deserve some credit for coming up with an early proposal and giving us the potential&#151;after all, we are only taking note of this White Paper&#151;to explore it much more fully.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07012477000013"></a>As I understand it, the Government looked at dual use of Trident&#151;whether one could put a battery of cruise missiles on those large boats, which one has to have if one is going to use Trident missiles, so one could have a cruise missile battery and also the possibility of being able to deploy Royal Marines in it&#151;and they came out against it. I can understand that, with a dedicated programme and the possibility of only three submarines, but I am told by people who should know that at no stage has there been a serious look at dual use of cruise missiles and at no stage has there been a serious look at where new cruise missile technology could take us. That is not good enough. It means that we are not looking at all the options. The only justification for that would be if one had decided that any nuclear deterrent has to penetrate ABM defences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07012477000014"></a>First, let us remember the Polaris situation. The Polaris was not able to penetrate Soviet ABM defences in the view of the then-Chief of Defence Staff from November 1975 as relayed to Ministers and as revealed in documents that are in the public domain until Chevaline was deployed for the first time in the summer of 1982. There was a seven-year period during which time, first, the Ministry of Defence tried&#151;in fact I believe that it succeeded&#151;to stop the then Chancellor of the Exchequer knowing that there was this gap; and secondly, there was no

Of course we had to keep it private. One was not in those days able to let the Soviet Union know that one had doubts about one&#146;s own deterrent capacity, so there are limits, but now it is a completely different situation. Some of the language is as though the Cold War is still continuing. </p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07012477000015"></a>What was needed to penetrate Soviet ABM defences and the argument about the Moscow criterion was the linchpin of the debates in 1978-79, yet they had to be kept private. Now we can openly discuss the question and it is not yet apparent for me whether that is the Prime Minister&#146;s criterion: that he wants a missile to be able to land on any country anywhere from any naval space. If we had all the money of the United States of course we would sign up to it tomorrow: that is a reasonable deterrent force. The Government can claim&#151;they deserve some credit for it&#151;that they have substantially reduced all the so-called tactical strategic nuclear weapons; taken them right out. They are wise and sensible for doing so. This is the start, not the end of a debate. If we replace the present Vanguard class I hope very much that the type of submarine is different from the one that we are currently imagining.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07012477000016"></a>It is not an appropriate response to mirror the situation of the government decision, which I broadly supported, to replace Trident in the early 1980s. We would be much wiser to start to think afresh on all those different questions. I do not mind taking a decision in principle that at the moment that looks the best option, which are much the same words as the previous speaker used, but I would not want to close down a cheaper option, particularly if I find out, as is highly likely, that we have insufficient money for the defence budget and for the maintenance of a credible Royal Navy.</p>

I notice that quite a few speakers have talked about abandoning the sub-strategic concept. I am not sure that that is necessarily such a good idea. I suspect that it is being covered by the present Government&#146;s position by stretching the concept of what constitutes a strategic deterrent rather than the complete abandonment of the other. In the world of changing threats it is perhaps overly restrictive to rule out sub-strategic as opposed to tactical use of nuclear weapons.</p>

I was lucky enough to be responsible for them for a few years when I was in the MoD. We have talked about our relationship with the US in the maintenance of our nuclear deterrent. It is important to stress that this is not a one-way street. Our work is of value to the US just as its work is of value to us. It is therefore salutary that we have spent a considerable amount of money over the past few years on improving the facilities at these sites to ensure that we can continue to verify that our nuclear deterrent works properly in the absence of the ability to test it. In addition, we have invested in the skills which, as the nuclear

It is vital for us to retain these skills or we will lose the ability to manage and maintain our deterrent.</p>

<a name="70124-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07012477000019"></a>We have been told that the long-term thinking needed for the replacement of Trident requires an early decision. It is perhaps more accurate to say that over the lifetime of any long-term weapon system, decisions are constantly being made on the relative merits of retention, refurbishment and replacement of that system. I am not absolutely convinced yet that the relative merits of refurbishment and replacement have been fully explored. It is worthy of note that the US, as was acknowledged by the Minister, with its vastly greater resources, still seeks to push the replacement date for its submarine fleet as far into the future as is practicable&#151;I think that 2045 has been mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07012477000020"></a>It is hard to credit that at some time around 2020 the bottom will drop out of all our submarines and they will no longer be of any use. Submarines are designed with a minimum life and are built to a very high standard. It must therefore be a logical engineering decision to extend that life. If, however, Trident must be replaced and the only viable option is a new fleet of submarines, so be it. But let us explore every viable choice first to ensure that we reach the most cost-effective solution. Refurbishment of the existing fleet must surely be the most attractive option. Modification of the Astute class submarine, despite the delay in bringing them into use, must also be fully considered. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, mentioned the possible utility of cruise missiles. Of course, the great problem is their range, but, as the noble Lord said, there is no reason why, given an extended life for the present fleet, we might not be able to design a missile which will be far more adaptable, far cheaper to develop and, ultimately, of far greater utility than the present system.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07012477000021"></a>I do not intend detaining noble Lords for long. Resources are finite. I passionately support the doctrine of expeditionary force, which has been outlined in successive defence papers. The deployment of our people to conflicts which are often far from our shores ensures that they remain the best fighting men and women in the world. For their quality and morale to be maintained, they must have the tools and rewards for the job. We require adequate numbers of people and pay that is commensurate with the risks they run on our behalf. Soldiers who run the risk of being killed for six months of each year when they are deployed probably deserve much greater rewards than if they are sitting at home indulging in weekend war games. They also require proper accommodation, and sea and air cover. It is unthinkable that an expeditionary force can be mounted without the proposed aircraft carriers. They are expensive. Equally, the heavy lift that we need by air is expensive. The rapid effect system and future soldier technology will cost billions. As the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said, it is difficult to imagine that decisions on the replacement of Trident can be taken in isolation. Of course they cannot. If the defence budget is not to be expanded to cover these many needs, the money has to come from somewhere else&#151;it does not grow on trees. The list of requirements

Resources are finite. If we wish to do everything that we say we are going to do, we must have these resources. Surely, we cannot contemplate replacing Trident at the expense of the men and women who carry out such valuable work for us every day.</p>

I work for an American defence contractor, Curtis-Wright. I also work for Leafield Engineering, a small defence company in Corsham.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07012478000002"></a>I echo the remarks of my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford that we need a credible deterrent. He went on to say that we should be doing everything we can to enforce the non-proliferation treaty. In view of the number of states that have become nuclear weapon states, I am afraid that I do not share his optimism. I think that the genie has come out of the bottle and I do not think it will be possible to put it back in again. I would make a rather gloomy forecast that, in 10 years&#146; time, there will be more nuclear weapon states than there are today. That is why it is even more important that we have a credible deterrent.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07012478000003"></a>I share my noble friend Lord Marlesford&#146;s worries about affordability. I would also like to pay great tribute to the extremely good speech from the noble Lord, Lord Owen. The Government are making the commitment that no conventional capability will be threatened by the whole idea of having a nuclear deterrent. I do not think that that bears inspection. The cost of the nuclear programme has never previously been separately identified in the defence budget, and we know that there has been a very difficult relationship over the past few years between the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence. I suspect that it will all get merged in together.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07012478000004"></a>I am concerned that the Minister said that the cost of this is &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion over 15 years. As has already been said, the Government&#146;s record on major construction programmes has not been great. One thinks of the Dome, the Scottish Parliament building and the Olympic Games, all of which seem to vastly exceed the original estimate. I am sure that the Minister will say that that has nothing to do with defence. But what about the Astute submarine programme? The Astute submarine was a relatively bog-standard submarine compared with Trident or a Trident replacement. The cost of that has escalated massively as well. As we have gone through a long period of not developing nuclear weapons, we will have to rebuild a quite massive skills base if we are going eventually to be in the business of building a replacement for Trident.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07012478000005"></a>I thought that the Prime Minister&#146;s remarks were pretty cool when he said that we should now be looking at significant increases in the defence budget. As the Minister pointed out earlier, however, we have actually seen an increase in 1.4 per cent a year in real terms, which I do not call significant at all. During that time, the Prime Minister has committed us to wars in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. I do not believe that the costs of those wars have  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1133"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been met. I would very much like to know whether the cost of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been fully funded by the Treasury. If the answer to that is yes, it certainly does not tie in with what I have heard from our Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07012478000006"></a>When we come to plan defence expenditure in future, it is optimistic to think that we will see significant increases in defence expenditure. Against that backdrop, we have seriously to consider the affordability of a massive programme such as this. As was said earlier, we need to see a capability to fight wars on two fronts at the same time&#151;a capability that we have now, or are trying to meet now. To fulfil what we are doing today in Iraq and Afghanistan, we need more infantry than we have now; we need close air support; we need armoured vehicles, which we do not have&#151;some are coming on stream but it is taking time&#151;and we need heavy lift helicopters. All this is very expensive to find, but as the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said, it does make the difference between whether our soldiers live or die. I think that this is absolutely critical.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07012478000007"></a>At the moment we are cursed with the problem of trying to pay for the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft&#151;which I have to admit was ordered under a Conservative Government, but at a much earlier time, for a conflict which we are not at all threatened by now. However, that is a massive expenditure which is making it extremely difficult to pay for the things that we actually need to conduct the wars that we are involved in in Iraq and Afghanistan. If one believes the press speculation, there is serious concern over whether the two carriers which are supposed to be coming through are going to happen at all.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07012478000008"></a>In the short term, the Treasury has a serious problem. It has massive borrowings to try to reduce, and the public expenditure growth rate for which it will be paying will probably be slowed considerably. Against that backdrop, it is difficult to see increases in defence expenditure. I do not think it is going to happen; indeed, I do not think it would happen under a Government of any colour. The priorities of schools and hospitals always seem to be far greater than those of defence in the world in which we live today. I hope that the Government will look seriously at cheaper alternatives. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, made the point about cruise missiles. I do not understand why they have been written off as a very expensive option. While you would have to design a special nuclear warhead to fit on the missiles, enormous sums would be saved because you would not have to build new submarines to fire them. That is because we are firing conventional cruise missiles from conventional hunter-killer submarines today. Therefore I cannot believe that it would not be a much cheaper option.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07012478000009"></a>When I raised this point with the Leader of the House, she was advised by her noble friend the Defence Minister that cruise missiles can be shot down. I felt a bit winged by that so I talked to some American friends of mine who actually designed the Tomahawk cruise missile and asked whether it is possible to shoot these things down. Perhaps the   


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1134"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Defence Minister was thinking back to the time of the Gulf War when the missiles were extremely basic. The only way to guide them to their targets in Baghdad was by taking them down a street and turning right at the traffic lights. The Iraqis quickly got on to that and set up anti-aircraft guns to shoot them down. Today cruise missiles fly in under the radar. They are then taken to high altitudes and can be brought down at any point of the compass straight onto the target. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, pointed out that they are extremely accurate because at the last minute television cameras are used to guide them to their target. So I do not accept that we have seriously considered the cheaper option of putting a nuclear warhead on to a cruise missile. Moreover, as has been discussed, the technology of the missiles will continue to improve and their weaponry will get ever more sophisticated.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07012478000010"></a>I sympathise with noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches because I am not sure that the question of extending the life expectancy of the Trident fleet has been fully explored. There is just too much differing opinion on this to accept the rather cavalier dismissal that we cannot look at Trident going on for 15 years longer than was originally anticipated. If that were the case, again we would see the technology improving as well. Therefore I have deep reservations and concerns about spending the vast sums of money being talked about because I do not think these plans will be separately funded by the Treasury, rather it will be our troops on the front line who pay the price.</p>

It is important to keep recalling that. It is said that, when the first test of a nuclear weapon took place at Alamogordo, the lead scientist at the time, Robert Oppenheimer, said under his breath these words from the Hindu <I>Upanishads</I>:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07012478000023"></a>&#147;I am come, Kali, destroyer of worlds, brighter than a thousand suns&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012478000022"></a>I mention that because, in the initial period of nuclear warfare, the main argument advanced to President Truman and others, and which has been quoted in this debate, was that a weapon of such immense destructive power would bring the war to an end very quickly. Indeed, after Nagasaki and Hiroshima that is what happened. It was regarded as a weapon beyond all the weapons that human beings had known about until then.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07012478000012"></a>In a second period, to which my noble friend Lord Rodgers and the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, referred, the Cold War, the nuclear weapon was essentially justified by the fact that it deterred the use of other nuclear weapons. All of us remember the title of that policy: mutually assured destruction. The moral argument for nuclear weapons was simply that they would never have to be deployed, because if they were, the response would be totally destructive. There is a sense in which, in both these periods, there was a rational argument to be made.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1135"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07012478000013"></a>One of the things that troubles me slightly about this debate is that the assumption made from the very beginning that deterrence was a rational response to a rational attack may no longer hold good. The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, talked about maniacal power. We have to recognise that at least some element of terrorism may not be deterred in any way by the prospect of destruction. It might strangely even be attracted by it, so powerful are some of the nihilistic and, indeed, death-loving elements that we now confront. It is a shame that in this debate we have so little addressed the nature of terrorism as distinct from the old-fashioned nuclear attack that is now probably highly unlikely. If we address the issue of terrorism, for a moment at least, one of the claims on our budget has to be the absolute control over existing nuclear materials and restricting and, indeed, stopping access to those materials by utterly irresponsible groups. Yet we as a country contribute extremely little towards such efforts to control the spread of nuclear materials. As a country we have not particularly favoured suggestions such as the fissile material cut-off, the nuclear fuel bank or the reduction in warning times of existing nuclear weapons, all of which would be a very important part of making the world a safer place.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07012478000014"></a>This debate has shown two great holes in the Government&#146;s White Paper, the first of which was effectively illustrated by my noble friend Lord Owen and the noble Lord, Lord Moonie. These raise huge questions about whether the country can afford to maintain a massive renewal of the nuclear deterrent and at the same time maintain its existing conventional forces in anything resembling proper operational capacity.</p>

The noble Baroness has not made clear where these terrorist groups would get their equipment from. It is beholden on her to address whether it is possible to deter the proxy nuclear state in these circumstances.</p>

The evidence is that it is certainly not impossible to lay one&#146;s hands on nuclear materials. The A Q Khan story shows just how dangerous that is. There have been a number of cautionary examples of terrorist groups attempting to get hold of nuclear materials. My point is very direct: we devote far less time, effort and resources to stopping access to these materials by various utterly irresponsible groups, including rogue states, than we do to addressing what one might describe above all as the traditional issue of assured nuclear deterrence, which I believe is no more relevant to modern warfare than the Maginot line was to the Second World War.</p>

I do not accept the assertion by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Epsom, that we should not make a major effort to sustain and strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is the central legal structure on which the limitation of nuclear weapons and the attempt to stop proliferation have been based. To wash our hands of it is to court the planet&#146;s destruction. If we see more and more proliferation, in more and more states, many of them without any obvious moral restraint on how they behave, the chances of our surviving through the next millennium seem extremely small.</p>

First, we should begin to recognise that Article VI of the NPT bites on the nuclear states, not just the non-nuclear states. Many of us are fed up with the unending hypocrisy of lecturing the non-nuclear nations about the need for them not to have nuclear weapons, while happily retaining our own and not even seeking to reduce them. In this context, I must be fair to the Minister. The United Kingdom has made more efforts than most to reduce the scale of its nuclear deterrent, and I welcome that. But generally speaking, the nuclear powers have made very little effort to obey Article VI, and we still see in the United States, Russia and other countries attempts to develop new generations of various kinds of nuclear weapon, such as the bunker buster. Secondly, it is important for the nuclear powers to reduce their vastly unnecessary stocks of nuclear weapons, to give some encouragement to those being asked not to enter the nuclear league.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07012478000020"></a>My final point has already been strongly underlined by my Front Bench; it is the argument that we could extend the life of the existing nuclear fleet. Some of us will know the expert arguments; and the experts are very great indeed. The people who have come from the United States to give testimony here are among the outstanding league of scientists in this field, not just in the nuclear field but in submarine warfare. Yesterday, Dr Richard Garwin, speaking to some of us, said that the life of the US fleet had been extended to 45 years a few years ago, and he saw absolutely no reason why the UK fleet&#146;s life could not be similarly extended. He went so far as to say that, in his view, the fact that the UK nuclear fleet is on station so much less of the time and is used so much less than the US fleet meant that the prospects of extending its life were very much better. When I asked him why he thought the White Paper said what it said, he replied:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07012478000021"></a>A very great deal is at stake: finances, resources, including the resources available to other parts of our Armed Forces and, not least, the time available to really move forward on an effort to restrengthen the NPT and to ensure that we take our decisions against a less uncertain situation than at present. I cannot understand why we are pressing for an early decision. If it is part of the Prime Minister&#146;s legacy, one can only say that it is utterly irresponsible not to wait a little longer until we have clearer facts, and above all until we know far more about the consequences for our resources of what we are trying to do. The White Paper does not yet carry consistency or confidence in this House, the other House or among the general population. I hope, therefore, that we will listen very carefully to what is emerging with increasing strength from this debate.</p>

<a name="07012484000001"></a><b><a name="70124-0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07012484000012"></a>Lord Bramall:</b> My Lords, the White Paper on continuing the United Kingdom&#146;s nuclear deterrent virtually presents Parliament with a fait accompli, with only a few details about the number of submarines and whether, how and when we need to refurbish the ongoing D5 missiles to be decided. With the world as dangerous and uncertain as it is, the future so unpredictable, and some volatile regimes apparently intent on doing us or our friends harm, it is so easy to say that we would be mad to forgo our own ultimate weapons system and must not do so&#151;a widely held view, to which Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition have signed up. I feel, however, that my most useful contribution, in the interests of wider analysis and debate&#151;until now conspicuously absent&#151;is to act as devil&#146;s advocate to that view. There are a number of other factors which the Government should consider very seriously before, as the song of <I>The Good Soldier  vejk</I> read, just keeping on keeping on, almost as if the world had not changed at all.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07012484000002"></a>First, it is difficult to see how the United Kingdom can exert any leadership and influence on the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty&#151;if that is what we and the rest of the world want and, essentially, need&#151;if we insist on a successor to Trident that would preserve our own nuclear-power status well into the second half of this century. On the other hand, abandonment, even perhaps before Trident finally wasted out, could be seen as a bold and striking decision intended to show that the country is resolved to return to the position of moral and ethical standards for which it was once widely recognised&#151;and seems largely to have forgotten recently&#151;and to exert some real leadership in the modern world, as the right reverend Prelate mentioned. Some major international player must take a lead in this. While making a further 20 per cent reduction in superfluous warheads may be seen as a gesture in the right direction, it hardly compares with abandoning Trident in favour of properly funding our Armed Forces with what they need to meet the commitments laid upon them, so that they can act, in that much vaunted phrase, as a force for good.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07012484000003"></a>Secondly, even our present nuclear deterrent cannot be seen as being truly independent of the United States in any substantial or useful sense. It  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1138"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>continuously relies on the United States for the provision of components for, and regular servicing of, the D5 missiles&#151;although not for the warheads, nor the launching submarines&#151;and for US information on certain aspects of operation. Any successor to Trident would, of necessity, be even more dependent on the United States, with significant and unsatisfactory implications for a proper, two-way US/UK relationship. While this country has, in theory, complete freedom of action over giving the order to fire, it is unthinkable that these terror weapons, which are virtually unusable because of the catastrophic consequences for guilty and innocent alike at a time when most weapons systems are scrupulously becoming more selective, would ever be launched or seriously threatened by this country&#151;itself intensely vulnerable to such weapons&#151;without the backing and underwriting of the United States.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07012484000004"></a>It is difficult to assign high probability to any scenario now discernible under which our own nuclear capability would be necessary because the United States was somehow not involved. NATO speaks for itself. In the Middle East the United States would certainly be the guarantor of Israel if any other Middle East country seriously threatened it. Meanwhile, should our own country become subject to some sort of nuclear blackmail&#151;from a terrorist group, for example&#151;it must be asked in what way, and against whom, our nuclear weapons could be used, or even threatened, to deter or punish. Our present weapons system has shown itself completely ineffective as a deterrent to the threats and scale of violence we currently, or are likely to, face&#151;particularly international terrorism. The more you analyse them, the more unusable such weapons systems appear. To use or threaten to use them against those who do not possess them would be to invite the outcry and retribution of the whole world; while for a country of the size and vulnerability of the United Kingdom to do so against a nuclear power would be to indulge in mutual suicide with untold consequences. With potential threats so diffuse and indirect, it would be virtually impossible to think of any obvious target, even if either the political will or any potential advantage existed, both of which are most unlikely.</p>

<a name="70124-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07012484000005"></a>The philosophy of the Cold War was an entirely different matter. The much cited &#147;seat at the table&#148; may no longer have the resonance it once did. Political clout is likely to come much more from economic strength, as expressed by the G8. Even major-player status in the international military scene is more likely to find expression through effective, strategically mobile conventional forces capable of taking out pinpoint targets than through the possession of unusable weapons. Any military case for continuing our own nuclear capability can be made, as the White Paper admits, only on the absolutely general and long-term basis that, in an uncertain and changing world, it might feel comforting to have such a powerful weapon in the armoury in, say, 25 or 50 years&#146; time&#151;just like an insurance policy against something which one hopes, and in this case has some reason to believe, will never happen.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07012484000006"></a>The really bald point is whether this country can afford nuclear deterrence considering what we are likely to get out of it. A successor to Trident, tied to the existing submarine-launched missile system, would cost at least &#163;25 billion, judging from some of the estimate over-runs on various projects, and probably even more. That is a vast amount over 30 years, which our defence budget&#151;now under immense pressure, already revealing massive funding gaps, particularly in the crunch period 2011-20&#151;could not possibly cope with, as the noble Lord, Lord Owen, with all his experience, has said. It would simultaneously have to provide the many things likely to be required and used in the defence field, as the Prime Minister has said.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07012484000007"></a>After the most careful thought, if the British deterrent comes to be seen more as a status symbol like an American Express gold or platinum card, rather than a serious military weapon of war adding to our Armed Forces&#146; effectiveness, even for hard battle&#151;the Prime Minister&#146;s phrase, not mine, but one to which I thoroughly subscribe&#151;and enhancing the security of our nation, &#163;25 billion would be a great deal to pay for something so nebulous and doubtful. I can imagine the Treasury&#146;s reaction if the argument &#147;You never know what lies around the corner&#148; was used to justify the proper size and shape for our conventional forces, which history has shown are always on call in the national interest.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07012484000008"></a>Therefore there must be a strong, perhaps over-riding case for the Government to continue to review such an important decision carefully, unemotionally, and taking into account changes in the international scene and in technological developments, even if this means delaying the decision. Before putting firm recommendations to Parliament, they should look first at other non-nuclear and sub-strategic options for our armoury with a far greater utility factor&#151;cruise missiles in some form might be one option&#151;which would still enhance both the deterrent power and the effectiveness of our Armed Forces. The aim at all times would be to achieve a greater flexibility in utility and selectivity of targeting than an exclusively megatonne nuclear solution can possibly provide, and at far less cost.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07012484000009"></a>Before Parliament is asked to endorse any Trident replacement, it should be made aware not only of the realistic costs&#151;I stress realistic&#151;but of how these costs are to be met and, if it is to be out of our defence vote, which is almost certainly going to be the case, of what compensating savings would have to be made to accommodate that replacement. If not, an assessment of the value and impact of such a decision would be incomplete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07012484000010"></a>My final devil&#146;s advocate question, although one which I hope noble Lords will feel is worthy of serious consideration, is: would this country not be better off morally and militarily without a new nuclear weapons system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07012497000002"></a>My noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill pointed out that our Labour Government were elected on a manifesto to renew and retain our independent deterrent. We would certainly be criticised extensively if we did not fulfil our manifesto commitments. The Labour Party, of which some Liberal Democrats used to be members, has been committed for almost all its existence to an independent deterrent. I say to my noble friend Lord Judd and to my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell, for both of whom I have great respect, that we need to bear that point in mind.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07012497000003"></a>Notwithstanding that commitment in the manifesto, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester so generously said, this Government are involved in the widest possible consultation. Indeed, it is unprecedented consultation. First, the Government reviewed all of the options that have been discussed today. Then, having reviewed them, they put forward this White Paper as a basis for consultation, for public debate as well as parliamentary debate. We are having this debate here, there will be one in the Commons, and the Commons will be voting on this issue. I say to those who criticise the Prime Minister&#151;I say this particularly to the Liberal Democrat Front Bench who cannot resist a pop at the Prime Minister; there seems to be some obsession&#151;that he needs to be given some credit for the consultation process. We had a Commons vote on Iraq as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07012497000004"></a>I feel very strongly that in this decision, as with global warming, we need to think in the very long term rather than the short term, in decades rather than years. Our generation&#151;and we are mostly of the same generation&#151;has enjoyed the advantages of the protection of the independent deterrent. We have seen peace in Europe in almost all of my lifetime. As for the timescale of the decision, I think everyone has accepted that, with perhaps the question of a year or two here or there, it will take a long time for these decisions to be implemented and most of us agree they have to be taken now. If we do not take the decision on submarines, we are in danger of depriving our children and our grandchildren of the kind of protection that we have enjoyed. They may face circumstances that we cannot foresee in which other powers threaten this country. I ask noble Lords to bear that in mind. We have had the protection and  we should not deprive our children and our grandchildren of it.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07012497000005"></a>The Liberal Democrats argue that we should delay the decision. I shall not describe this as the usual fence sitting by the Liberal Democrats. The White Paper makes a powerful case that a clear decision has to be made. In all conscience, it is a difficult decision&#151;my noble friend Lord O'Neill argues that it is a popular one&#151;and it may even be unpopular. Do Governments voluntarily bring forward difficult decisions&#151;decisions that may not be the most popular&#151;and suggest that it is merely part of the Prime Minister's legacy? Again, that is the Liberal Democrats indulging in their obsession.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07012497000006"></a>Some argue, as has been argued today, that nuclear weapons are immoral. No weapon is moral or immoral in itself. It depends on the motivation for possessing such a weapon and the uses to which it is or may be put. That applies to every weapon. If peace can best be maintained by the possession of and the threat to use a weapon, surely that is a positive argument in its favour. The choice in this case, as in many cases, is between the lesser of two evils. Some argue that as the Cold War is over, this deterrent is not needed because the threats now come from rogue states or from terrorists. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, argued that. To deal with that, the Government are improving and extending our counterinsurgency forces and we are strengthening our security and intelligence services. So we are dealing separately with that threat, but the nuclear capability is designed to meet other potential threats, just as tanks, aircraft carriers and our other capabilities have other purposes as well.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07012497000007"></a>We face a threat from nuclear or near-nuclear states at the moment and from others that may acquire nuclear weapons in the next few decades. We need to be prepared for that. Perhaps we need an insurance policy&#151;sometimes insurance policies are wise things to have. Some argue, notably the Scottish National Party, that we should be non-nuclear, like Sweden or Norway. Those illustrations are used again and again. That is a naive comparison because we have a totally different history and background from the Scandinavian countries and from other countries. Whether we like it or not, there is a current enmity towards the United Kingdom from some of the nearby nuclear regimes because Britain has stood side-by-side with the United States on the international stage. We must accept, therefore, that we are more vulnerable to attack.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07012497000008"></a>It is said by some&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said it today&#151;that the plan goes against the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The Minister dealt with that in relation to the reduction in warheads by 20 per cent, having reduced them already by 30 per cent&#151;a total of 50 per cent&#151;and the reduction of the number of submarines. That commitment to nuclear non-proliferation should be acknowledged.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07012497000009"></a>Unilateralists also argue&#151;this point was made by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, acting as the devil's advocate although, at times, he almost sounded like the devil himself&#151;that if we make this bold move of nuclear disarmament, others will follow. Where is the evidence to support that? Who will follow? I ask those who argue that to name any country that will follow our bold example. I doubt that any will be forthcoming.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07012497000010"></a>It is also suggested that possession is illegal, but there are no rulings of the International Court of Justice. The South Americans took the question to the ICJ, but there was no ruling about the illegality of possession of these weapons. Strangely enough, the only legal ruling was in the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland where the Faslane protestors took the issue. There was a clear ruling that the possession of such weapons was not illegal.</p>

I shall make two points in relation to that suggestion. First, a Government&#146;s first duty is to protect its citizens so children can go to school safely and people can go to hospital safely. Secondly, we are still spending more money on schools, hospitals and international development.

I support the case made in the White Paper for modernising our nuclear deterrent. Indeed, I regard it as self-evident. My reservations, which I shall come on to, relate to the number of warheads and submarines. In essence, I do not believe we can have fewer than four submarines to enable one to be on patrol at all times, and I have some concern that the Government may be preparing an escape route on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07012497000022"></a>Before coming to those issues, I shall make a few general observations. First, on the non-proliferation treaty, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, spoke eloquently, it is a major objective to make it more effective. However, as we heard, Britain has set a good example by greatly reducing the size of its nuclear deterrent force. Other countries have greatly reduced their stocks of nuclear warheads, although more could certainly be done. I do not think it would be right to say that modernising an existing nuclear deterrent by one of the countries that was recognised to be in a special position by the NPT sets a bad example, especially not if one effect of that modernisation is to make the nuclear weapons safer and, possibly, less indiscriminate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07012497000023"></a>I note that there are people&#151;indeed, one is sitting very close to me, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall&#151;who argue that we would never be prepared to use our nuclear deterrent, even in extremis. That fails to understand the resolve of our prime ministers to make choices with huge consequences, and I make that comment based on very close-quarters observation of some of them.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07012497000024"></a>Some noble Lords have argued that we face a new breed of enemy who is impervious to the threat of nuclear retaliation. That ignores the experience of the first Gulf War when the late Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction but did not use them because he was told very explicitly indeed what the consequences of using them would be. In that case, deterrence certainly worked. Even the baddest of enemies&#151;and we are likely to face some very bad and nuclear-armed enemies in future&#151;have a well developed sense of self-preservation. They are much less likely to use nuclear weapons or pass them on as proxies to terrorists if the price of that is retaliation. Only nuclear weapons deter the use of nuclear weapons; nothing else does.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07012497000025"></a>The nuclear threat is not as clear and present a danger just now as it was at the height of the Cold War, but we are not talking about &#147;just now&#148;; we are  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1144"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>talking about a deterrent capability stretching into the second half of this century. No one can have a precise idea of the sort of enemy or threat we shall face in that timescale, although it is clear that there will be more nuclear-armed countries, possibly many more, and some of them will be unstable and aggressive. So why allow an insurance policy against nuclear attack that we took out decades ago to lapse now in such troubled and potentially dangerous times? In that dangerous world, it is highly likely that Britain will again have to intervene militarily in regional conflicts, as we have recently, and rightly, in Iraq and Afghanistan. The difference will be that in future some of those conflicts are likely to involve nuclear-armed regional states. Without our own nuclear deterrent as a back-up, we could not take the risk of intervening with conventional forces. In other words, it is essential that we are able to prevent ourselves being deterred, and only possession of an independent deterrent can guarantee that.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07012497000026"></a>I do not entirely shy away from arguing that we should also preserve the deterrent for reasons of status, although, of course, the primary arguments are all military. Our status is earned by our contribution to preserving peace and stability, which gives us the influence to pursue wider British objectives and interests. We are more influential, in particular, on national security issues, than several comparable G8 countries, such as Germany, because we are more willing and able to make an effective military contribution in times of crisis and our nuclear deterrent guarantees that we shall continue to be able to do that whatever threats face us.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07012497000027"></a>Turning to the choice of system, I am sure that the Government have made the right choice in sticking to Trident for the same reasons that guided the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, to choose it in the first place. A submarine-based system provides the most effective form of deterrence with the smallest footprint. I listened very carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said about cruise missiles. First, I hope that he is wrong that the Ministry of Defence failed to examine carefully and in detail the case for cruise missiles. Not to have done so would be extremely unprofessional, and I would be most reluctant to believe that of the Ministry of Defence, as I know it.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07012497000028"></a>Secondly, I think that there are genuine question marks over the range and capability of cruise missiles. Perhaps I am old fashioned, but I still believe that there is something in the old maxim of preferring to stick with nurse for fear of something worse. Sticking to the Trident system may turn out to be the best course.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07012497000029"></a>It has also been suggested that the lifetime of the existing force could be considerably extended. In recalling past alarms about cracks appearing in our nuclear submarines and the need to withdraw them from service for extended periods, I rather doubt that some of the wilder claims made for extending the life of our submarine force could ever be justified.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07012497000030"></a>I disagree with those who argue that the money spent on our nuclear deterrent could more cost-effectively be invested in conventional forces. We do

That is what our nuclear capability enables us to do.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07012497000031"></a>My final point is to urge the Government to remain firm in their resolve to maintain adequate numbers of warheads and submarines. I find the White Paper less than wholly reassuring on that point. We already maintain only a minimum deterrent, in line with our goal of reducing the number of nuclear weapons overall. But you cannot have your disarmament cake and eat it. Given the range of threats, which the White Paper rightly identifies, the head room for further reductions in the number of warheads simply does not exist. I am also deeply sceptical whether it is possible to build the sort of submarines needed to ensure that one is on patrol at all times if we have only three in total. We must  be able to meet the operational and targeting requirements of keeping our deterrent credible. It would be a false economy to save millions if that makes the expenditure of billions on a deterrent system ineffective.</p>

<a name="70124-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07012497000032"></a>I hope very much that the Government will not weaken in their commitment to maintain continuous at-sea deterrence by building the number of boats required to achieve that and that there will not be pressure to abandon that position either by Treasury cheese-paring or by a need to appease those who oppose our nuclear deterrent altogether.</p>

I do not want to go into the ethics of the argument this afternoon, as that debate has not changed over the past 30 years, although the context has. Climate change will bring unknown consequences. Scientists are unable to model exactly where we are going with climate change, and social scientists cannot model what the consequences will be. Among the possible effects that they have outlined are mass migration, resource shortages, especially of food and water, and an atmosphere of great instability and vulnerability. In such an atmosphere, it could be argued, it would be important to have an independent nuclear deterrent to deter people from encroaching on our resources. But, can we really envisage a situation where we would launch an attack on people, for example refugees, threatening to overwhelm us?</p>

The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, has outlined the various scenarios. He is evidently far more qualified to do so than I am, but very serious questions need to be asked about how relevant nuclear deterrence is in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07012499000004"></a>A number of noble Lords have pointed to the need for resources to go into conventional military weapons and other areas of demand such as schools and hospitals. As long ago as 1995, the opinion of quite a body of leading economists was brought together in a book called <I>Economists and the Environment</I>. Their opinion, even then, was that it made far more sense to spend less on weapons and more on the environment.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07012499000005"></a>There are some striking parallels between the calculations of the overall cost of buying the missiles, replacing the submarines and maintaining the system for 30 years&#151;estimated by some as &#163;76 billion&#151;and the cost of making some real inroads into reducing our carbon emissions by a level approaching the Government&#146;s target. So far as anyone can calculate, that figure is &#163;60 billion to &#163;80 billion. So when discussing where resources should go, it is important that climate change is part of the equation.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07012499000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, made the point about jobs. Jobs can be found equally well in the cutting-edge, scientific developments of carbon-reduction technologies and, not least in this country, in adaptation&#151;as we know, climate change is already under way. We have to adapt much more rapidly and take cognisance of the issue more than we have hereto. The Government are budgeting, I believe, less than &#163;1 billion a year to tackle directly all the climate change issues, but, as the Stern report showed, we need to spend far more than that and far quicker. The speed with which we tackle these effects will be crucial; we cannot afford to spend at the end of the period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07012499000007"></a>Much has been made of what we will leave to our children as an inheritance if we do not have the security of a nuclear weapons system. However, I believe that world security will be about adequate energy, water and food in the 21st century, and about each country having controlled its needs and consumption so that it feels secure enough. That will take a sea change in the amount of investment in research and development, agriculture, water conservation and so on. We will probably have to redesign the very way we live. We need that sort of investment for a secure future. We should have already decided to make such investment now. Instead, the Government seem to feel that they must make a thoroughly premature decision on a weapons system whose relevance in the 21st century many analysts, including many speakers this afternoon, have questioned.</p>

I am privileged to be the president of the World Disarmament Campaign; and I should tell my noble friends Lord Foulkes and Lord O&#146;Neill that there are an awful lot of very worried people out there, even if they do not always succeed in making their voices heard.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07012499000010"></a>We may begin with a premise on which we can all agree: we want to make this country as secure as possible in a dangerous world. The issue is how that can best be done. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has just reminded us that threats come in a range of forms, so we should not take too narrow a view of what threatens the security of this country. Even if we take the narrow view, the question is bound to arise of what contribution Trident can make in response to threats.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07012499000011"></a>In their response to the report of the House of Commons Defence Committee, the Government said: </p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="07012499000068"></a>&#147;We do not see Trident as a weapon system for fighting wars, but as having a fundamentally political role in deterring aggression&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012499000061"></a>A deterrent can deter only if there is a possible situation and manner in which someone might contemplate using it. As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, quite properly reminded us, we are considering a devastating weapon. My noble friend Lord Drayson told us that it was intended only for strategic purposes; I hope that my noble friend Lord Triesman can elaborate on that when he concludes.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07012499000012"></a>I realise that we want to keep potential enemies guessing, but surely the whole purpose of this debate is to inform us what is proposed, so that we may pass some kind of judgment on it. Would it be used only to counter a nuclear attack, or could it be used against conventional forces? Might it be used against enemy forces, to counter a political invasion of this country? In a contemporary form of warfare, are we likely to see enemy forces conveniently deployed in an open battlefield? Even leaving aside the question of fallout, would we explode our warheads among the tower blocks of Bermondsey or the housing estates of Basildon?</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07012499000013"></a>Contemporary wars, as nearly everyone now agrees, are fought among civilian populations in narrow streets or public squares. If the proposed use is for retaliatory purposes, are we proposing to use them against other people&#146;s crowded cities? Do we envisage another, bigger Hiroshima? I hope that no other country would believe us capable of that, but if they do not, how and where is the possible deterrent effect? A credible deterrent would, surely, need to be more proportionate and user-friendly.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07012499000014"></a>That brings us to the next question. It is difficult to consider what our response to an anticipated threat should be without having some idea of its nature and  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1148"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whence it may come. The White Paper considers that there is, at present, no identifiable threat. It says, in paragraph 3.8:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07012499000069"></a>&#147;Currently no state has both the intent to threaten our vital interests and the capability to do so with nuclear weapons&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012499000062"></a>The Government&#146;s case, as I understand it, can be encapsulated in the slogan &#147;You never know&#148;, which has been given as a reason for everything from galoshes to elephant guns.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07012499000015"></a>The Defence Committee considered that the most pressing threat faced by the UK is international terrorism, to which a number of noble Lords referred. To my knowledge, no one has sought to argue that nuclear weapons could be used against terrorists, or in any event that they would be deterred by the possibility of such use. If it is suggested that they might be used against rogue states, should a rogue state that encourages terrorists be visited with nuclear warheads? If that is so, perhaps my noble friend Lord Triesman could make it clear.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07012499000016"></a>The problem with preparing to meet a threat that cannot be assessed is that what the Government propose may create the very situation that they fear. It would not be the first time that a country created defences against a real or imagined threat and other countries, with absolutely no previous aggressive intention, perceived the defences as a threat to themselves and responded by creating their own defences. We then have a vicious cycle: of defence perceived as a threat, leading to defence perceived as a threat, leading to defence&#151;the classic paradigm of an arms race.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07012499000017"></a>I return to the initial premise. The Government are concerned to safeguard the security of this country; so are we all. The question then arises of how that can best be done. An answer that many people give is that Britain would be most secure in a world where nuclear weapons do not proliferate, a world where the objectives of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty are realised, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has pointed out. They would say that anything undermining the treaty is counterproductive and leaves us not safer but in greater danger. That raises the question: if the Government believe that nuclear weapons are essential to our security, how can we convince the non-nuclear states that they are not essential to theirs? The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, who is not in his place, raised that question. </p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07012499000018"></a>The White Paper addresses that question in  box 3.1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07012499000070"></a>&#147;The NPT recognised the UK&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012499000063"></a>and certain other states,</p>
<ul><a name="07012499000076"></a>&#147;as nuclear weapon States, and established other signatories as non-nuclear weapon States&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70124-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07012499000019"></a>There are two criticisms of that. First, it does not answer the question. If nuclear weapons are essential to the security of the United Kingdom, are the non-nuclear states to be left devoid of security? To point out that they have no right to be secure will hardly persuade them.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07012499000020"></a>Secondly, that answer rests on a false premise. The White Paper points out, quite correctly, that Article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty does not  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1149"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>establish a timetable for nuclear or general disarmament. It does not, but it froze the situation as it was in 1968, creating two classes of state: those that had manufactured or exploded a nuclear weapon or device prior to 1 January 1967&#151;the nuclear weapons states&#151;and those that had not. That was the best that could be managed then, because those that had weapons could not be persuaded to discard them. No one believed that all the other states would accept second-class status until the end of time. They agreed to those terms because, under Article VI, the nuclear weapons states agreed to negotiate in good faith for two things: first, nuclear disarmament, and, secondly, &#147;general and complete disarmament&#148;.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07012499000021"></a>The treaty was envisaged as an interim measure until nuclear and general disarmament could be achieved. The suggestion that the non-nuclear states were prepared to accept second-class status for eternity would have been an idea from cloud-cuckoo-land.</p>

The greatest danger would have been if the treaty had disappeared altogether, before Article VI had been complied with. It was still, as I understand it, intended to fill a gap, however long that continued. I cannot believe that the non-nuclear states believed that they would have had second-class status &#147;forever and a day&#148;, as the hymn puts it.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07012499000024"></a>It is as though Parliament, when creating the offence of carrying an offensive weapon, had exempted those who were already carrying one. The preamble to the treaty exhibits a clear sense of urgency, with the words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07012499000071"></a>&#147;Declaring their intention to achieve at the earliest possible date the cessation of the nuclear arms race&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012499000025"></a>The non-nuclear states have for some years shown signs of impatience that the nuclear weapons states have exhibited no great anxiety to deliver on that part of the deal. Until now, as my noble friend Lord Drayson said, the United Kingdom could at least claim that it had substantially reduced its nuclear weaponry and was therefore moving towards disarmament, but to make a major investment in replacing Trident would send a clear signal that we see the treaty, with its class distinction, not as an interim arrangement but as, at best, indefinite and, at worst, permanent.</p>

In place of the 20 to 30 nuclear weapons states predicted at that time, there are only eight or nine, depending on how you choose to score North Korea. They are the five countries which were nuclear weapons states and recognised as such when the treaty was signed, which are the five permanent members of the Security Council, and the three countries that never signed the non-proliferation treaty and are generally assumed to have nuclear weapons&#151;India, Israel and Pakistan.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07012499000030"></a>During those 40 years, it has proved possible to roll back nuclear weapons programmes in South Africa, Libya and Iraq, to persuade several countries formerly part of the Soviet Union to pass up the opportunity to retain nuclear weapons&#151;Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine&#151;and to persuade other countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, to forgo nuclear research programmes which could have had weapons implications.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07012499000031"></a>My second point cuts right across the first: the non-proliferation treaty regime is now under greater threat than it has ever been before from a number of different angles, most obviously from North Korea&#146;s defiance of its treaty obligations and from Iran&#146;s refusal, so far, to take the necessary steps to convince the international community that its clandestine uranium enrichment and other activities are not designed to provide a short cut to a weapons programme.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07012499000032"></a>It is also under threat from tensions arising out of the existence of the three non-signatory de facto possessors of nuclear weapons: India, because of the not very satisfactory bilateral agreement entered into by the US last year; Pakistan, because of the supposedly freelance activities of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan; and Israel, because of the ever worsening situation in the Middle East. Then there is the failure

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07012499000033"></a>It is the last of those three shortcomings which is most germane to our debate today. To what extent can the Government's proposals be considered as conforming to the commitments that we gave? Clearly, the reduction in the ceiling on the number of warheads, from 200 to 160, can be presented as progress towards nuclear disarmament, but could we not manage to maintain deterrence at a lower level of warheads than that? The same point could be made if there were to be a reduction in the submarine fleet from four to three, but that is not certain. It should surely become so, especially since the hair-trigger standby arrangements needed during the Cold War are no longer justifiable. What is less easy to defend is deciding on Trident replacement earlier than is strictly speaking necessary, at a time of great fragility for the NPT regime as a whole.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07012499000034"></a>Britain's interest in and obligations towards the non-proliferation treaty do not stop with the future of its own nuclear deterrent; they extend to reversing recent trends towards a weakening and perhaps even a collapse of that regime. That trend was most evident in 2005, when two attempts to strengthen the regime led to deadlock both at the NPT Review Conference in May and at the UN summit in September.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07012499000035"></a>For that trend to be reversed, the following six steps need to be taken as a matter of urgency. First, there needs to be strong renewed pressure to bring into effect the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That will mean persuading the United States to look again at its refusal to ratify the treaty. Secondly, all the recognised nuclear-weapons states should resume implementation of the 13 steps to which they committed themselves in 2000. Thirdly, negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty should be engaged in and brought to an early successful conclusion.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07012499000036"></a>Fourthly, all countries with safeguard agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency should accept and ratify the agency&#146;s additional protocol. If, within a certain period, that is not done, the Security Council should adopt a Chapter VII resolution making that a mandatory requirement. Fifthly, negotiations at the IAEA to establish an internationally guaranteed system for the supply of enriched uranium and spent fuel reprocessing available to all civil nuclear users whose safeguards are in good standing should be completed in 2007. That should be matched by a voluntary and possibly time-limited moratorium on the construction of further enrichment and reprocessing facilities. Sixthly, it should be made clear that the establishment of nuclear weapons-free zones&#151;in the Middle East, in particular&#151;remains an integral part of any peace process.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07012499000037"></a>It is evident that those six steps would not of themselves present solutions to the hard cases of North Korea and Iran but they would greatly increase the pressure all round on those two countries to come into line with the requests made of them by the Security Council. In any event, the fragility of the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1152"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>non-proliferation treaty will not be remedied simply by finding bilateral fixes to those two hard cases; that also requires the strengthening of the multilateral disciplines that underpin the regime. Strengthening those disciplines would also reassure North Korea and Iran that they were not being picked on as isolated cases but were merely being asked to accept the same disciplines as other non-nuclear weapons states.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07012499000038"></a>As for the two hard cases of North Korea and Iran, we must recognise that Britain and its European partners have a less prominent role to play in the former than the latter. The six-nation group dealing with the North Korean issue clearly needs to remain the main focus of international diplomacy and those outside that group need to give the process strong support. On Iran, we are, with our EU partners, a member of the core group handling the matter. Currently there is a stand-off, with no talks let alone negotiations taking place.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07012499000039"></a>The sanctions decided by the Security Council are likely soon to come into effect, justifiably so if Iran makes no move to comply with the requests put to it unanimously by the Security Council. But should we not then seek to resume dialogue with Iran without making any preconditions? Should we not also be telling our US partners that the discrepancy between their willingness to talk bilaterally and without preconditions to North Korea and their refusal to do so with Iran is increasingly difficult to justify and defend, whatever one may think of the policies of the Iranian Government?</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07012499000040"></a>We must ask ourselves one question that relates directly to today&#146;s debate: does Britain's decision on Trident make it more difficult to handle the cases of North Korea and Iran? Or, to put it another way, would our abandoning Trident be likely to provide effective leverage on those two countries? I think that the answer is no to both questions. Neither country is motivated to any significant extent by Britain's nuclear status, which both accepted when they signed the non-proliferation treaty. Neither, unfortunately, would be likely to be swayed by a unilateral decision on our part to abandon that status.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07012499000041"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to indicate in his winding-up speech whether the Government support the broad ideas and the six steps that I have proposed, or some variant of them. If they support such an approach, would it not be timely for either the Prime Minister or the Foreign Secretary at an early date to set out in a public speech the British Government&#146;s overall position on nuclear non-proliferation and thus to make clear that, in taking this decision on Trident, they intend not only to continue to fulfil the commitment to move towards nuclear disarmament but to step up their effective support for strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation treaty regime? Would it not also be timely for similar support to be forthcoming from this year&#146;s G8 summit in Germany, and for the British Government to take an early initiative to bring that about?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07012499000042"></a>The problem with the nuclear non-proliferation issue is that it is complex, technical and poorly understood. Yet few areas of policy are more vital to peace and security in the 21st century. Surely it is high time that political leaders moved it higher up their common agenda and explained it to their electorates in terms more easily understood than those hitherto employed. The two-minutes-forward tick of the Doomsday clock may be a crude way of doing that, but it points the way towards greater urgency and a clearer understanding of what is at stake.</p>

Bertrand Russell contacted Albert Einstein, and through that contact initiated what became known as the Russell-Einstein manifesto. It was a call to scientists, whose discipline had created the nuclear bomb, to lead the way in preventing nuclear war.</p>

<a name="70124-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07012499000044"></a>However, that call reached far beyond the scientific community. It was more than a commitment to abolish nuclear weapons. The manifesto recognised that the world was a dangerous place, with real potential for conflict around every corner. It recognised the tremendous destructive powers of these new weapons of mass destruction and the appalling and lasting effects of large amounts of radiation. It put the question, &#147;Shall we put an end to the human race or shall mankind renounce war?&#148;. It was really an urgent call to the inhabitants of this globe of ours to recognise that this new capacity for destruction meant that war should become unthinkable. It was a call for a world based on law, consent and new multinational methods of conflict resolution. It was a call for the reinforcement of the new United Nations Security Council and for international treaties, and it is as relevant today as it was then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07012499000045"></a>Recent events have shown that we are far from renouncing war. It still deeply shocks me, as we pore over the events that led up to the Iraq invasion, that even as we sought a second UN resolution, the Prime Minister&#146;s aim was not to prevent war but to justify it. At the core of their manifesto, Russell and Einstein make the clear statement that,</p>
<ul><a name="07012499000077"></a>&#147;there can be no winners in a nuclear war&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07012499000064"></a>I think that the world, in between times, has recognised that. Many distinguished international lawyers today take the view that the use of the Trident system&#151;not the having of it&#151;would breach customary international law, because it would infringe the intransgressable requirement that a distinction be drawn between combatants and non-combatants.</p>

It is also impossible to imagine that the use of nuclear weapons would meet the requirement of proportionality in accordance with the just war principles. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, mentioned the International Court of Justice. He was wrong, I am afraid, because in 1996 that court stated very clearly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07012499000072"></a>&#147;In view of the unique characteristics of nuclear weapons ... the use of such weapons in fact seems scarcely reconcilable with respect for&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="07012499000065"></a>just war principles.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07012499000047"></a>Trident nuclear warheads are 100 to 120 kilotonnes each. A low-yield Trident would reduce a whole town to rubble. Each warhead has at least eight times the explosive power of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, and each submarine carries four to eight warheads. Let us think about that for a moment. As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, said, conventional weapons are increasingly smart. They are certainly capable of greater discrimination than nuclear weapons. A nuclear warhead, by its very nature, creates devastation that cannot be contained. The long-term effects of radiation&#151;cancers, birth defects and burns&#151;have perhaps been forgotten in this debate.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07012499000048"></a>Recently obtained legal opinions by Peacerights and Greenpeace also take the view that the replacement of Trident would be a material breach of our obligations under Article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Why does international law matter? It matters because we know that it is the best attempt to preserve the human race and to show our allegiance to humanity. Joseph Rotblat, the great British scientist who won the Nobel peace prize and who sadly died last year, reminded us that throughout the centuries we prepared for war, so what we got was war, not peace. What we now have to do is to prepare for peace, and we can do that only if we extend our present loyalties to our families, to our friends, to our cities, to our nation and to the whole of mankind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07012499000049"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, asked how we can forbid countries such as Iran and North Korea from developing nuclear capacity as we enhance our own arsenal. How can we talk to any other nation about reducing its nuclear capacity if we speak with forked tongues about our own defence needs? The only way to make multilateral disarmament real is by someone taking a lead, and I, like the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, would like to see Britain do just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07012499000050"></a>Military experts have been arguing convincingly that we do not need to rush to renew Trident now, and that there should be a more measured and deliberative process of public debate. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, maintained that there had been wide consultation on the White Paper, but I am afraid that  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1155"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>does not accord with what most people would understand by consultation. The public are very critical of processes that are described as consultation but which are merely a cosmetic veneer to dress up decisions that have already been taken. I am afraid that, for many people, that is how this feels. It already feels as though this is done and dusted. The public were taken by surprise by the announcement by the Prime Minister and again by Gordon Brown that Trident would be renewed, and many thought that the reference to the Government&#146;s commitment in the Labour Party manifesto to retain a nuclear deterrent meant precisely that; a commitment to retain what we had, not the introduction of a new generation of warheads.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07012499000051"></a>Twenty-five billion pounds is a huge amount of public money, which many feel would be better spent on better operational capacity for the Army in the field and better accommodation for Army personnel at home. There have been repeated accounts about the underequipment of our Army as it is stretched to the limits on two war fronts. The Government argue that new threats may come from rogue states using terrorists as proxy operatives, perhaps even supplying terrorists with fissile material. I want to ask what we intend to do: are we going to nuke the rogue states that behave in that way rather than use traditional military and diplomatic methods? Are we going to kill and radiate the people who have the misfortune to live under oppressive regimes?</p>

I personally hope that Britain will show leadership in the world and redeem the moral authority we have lost over the Iraq war. The White Paper is supposed to launch a public debate and I hope that the public will be encouraged to take part in such a debate. I would like to hear from the Minister how that will be encouraged and what steps will be taken to bring in the public and allow them to be heard.

We are discussing the most terrible weapons of mass destruction ever devised. They are there now. They could destroy the world many times over and they could be used. Whoever starts it, no one can win a nuclear war, as the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, has reminded us from the Russell-Einstein manifesto.

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07012499000054"></a>We are discussing Armageddon. I remind us all of what that means by referring to a report made in the 1980s by the Medical Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons. I hesitated on that name because I was a member of that campaign and we used to call ourselves &#147;Docs against the bomb&#148;. As we have been reminded, the bomb at Hiroshima was a terrible event in human history and I make no apology now for a passionate doctor to follow a passionate lawyer on the subject, because we need to remind ourselves what happened at Hiroshima, committed by a very small bomb by today&#146;s standards. It killed 68,000 people immediately and badly injured 76,000. Countless thousands of people went missing and were never accounted for.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07012499000055"></a>I quote from an eyewitness cited in the report to which I referred:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07012499000074"></a>&#147;No one knew what had happened. Skin was hanging from faces and hands of the survivors. People lay on pavements vomiting and waiting for death. They were too weak to move and no one was there to help. A priest came in from the outskirts and found a group of soldiers with wholly burned faces and eye sockets hollow with the fluid from melting eyes running down cheeks&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07012499000067"></a>They had been unfortunate enough to see the blast. The eyewitness continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07012499000075"></a>&#147;Three out of 45 hospitals remained in Hiroshima, most of the doctors dead or too badly wounded to help others. In the Red Cross hospital 1.6 km from the explosion, ceilings had fallen, plaster, dust, vomit were everywhere, thousands of dead and dying patients lying inside and on the driveway&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70124-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07012499000056"></a>In many ways those people about whom I have been talking were the lucky ones. They died in a few days, but in the weeks, months and years that followed thousands more died from the effects of bone marrow suppression, cancer, bowel erosions and diarrhoea, and later generations suffered and still suffer from genetic disorders. That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about toy weapons. All that was from a 13 kilotonne bomb, a small bomb by today&#146;s standards. We now use megatonne bombs, 760 times more damaging than that dropped on Hiroshima if we do the sums. A bomb dropped on Westminster would mean no London as far out as Croydon, Enfield and Kingston: no people, no emergency workers, no hospitals, even no Government. We must not forget the scale of those weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07012499000057"></a>Many noble Lords have questioned whether the possession of nuclear weapons acts as a deterrent. I will be brief about that, but if we say that our possession of a nuclear bomb is a deterrent to nuclear war we cannot then say that other countries should not have that deterrent. It is totally illogical. Iran has been mentioned: how can we tell Iran that it must not have a nuclear weapon when its neighbouring country Israel has one, on the admission of its Prime Minister a few weeks ago? I sometimes think rather flippantly that if it was truly a deterrent the international community should make sure that everyone has one little bomb and then we could all deter one another. What a nonsense concept it is; and what of this non-proliferation treaty mentioned by many noble Lords? We agreed then that every signatory should have nuclear energy if they wished. We are complaining about Iran at the moment. We agreed that those without the bomb should not try to obtain

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07012499000058"></a>In keeping and updating Trident, surely we are acting illegally against the non-proliferation treaty. I would like the Minister in his summing up to clarify that point for me. It is a sincere request for clarification and information. As other noble Lords have said, if terrorists strike with nuclear weapons, where do we strike back? Do we drop nuclear bombs on the civilian populations of north Pakistan, where it is alleged that there are terrorists hiding, or Manchester, where we know that there were terrorists hiding after 7 July? Where do we drop those bombs? They are not relevant to a terrorist attack.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07012499000059"></a>I have no idea what the cost is going to be. I am told that it is &#163;25 billion to update the weapons rising to &#163;76 billion if we take the maintenance into account&#151;enormous costs. As the noble Lord, Lord Owen, who is not in his place, asked in his fascinating and brilliant speech, what about our ordinary defence forces? Is it obscene that we possess nuclear weapons but there are soldiers in Iraq who did not have sufficient body armour for  the job they were supposed to do? Is it obscene that we have nuclear weapons in this country and our Armed Forces, wives, children and families are accommodated in the most appalling homes and flats? Is it not appalling that we have nuclear weapons in this country yet, when there is a natural disaster, a cry goes out for helicopters and not only do we not have enough helicopters, which are the only seriously useful thing that the Armed Forces possess&#151;that is a flippant remark, but they are seriously useful&#151;but we do not have any heavy lift equipment to get them out to where they are needed, whether it is Mozambique, Kashmir or wherever is the disaster? It is verging on the obscene that we have nuclear weapons, yet we cannot do the things that we want to do. Money spent on the developing world, and on our own education and health services, would be a far better investment.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07012499000060"></a>In his opening remarks, the Minister said, as does the White Paper, that the number of warheads in the Trident system will be reduced. It will be fully independent, not dependent on the United States, which is good news, and it will form only 1 per cent of world nuclear capability. Nevertheless, let us not doubt that by updating this system, we are pushing the world into a new arms race.

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="070124109000002"></a>For many of us, the terms of this debate and the context in which it is taking place have changed enormously over the past 30 years. The whole question of whether this country should have a nuclear deterrent was one of the overarching points of political controversy in my youth. It was a topic that was never very far from the top of the Labour Party&#146;s agenda and that&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, described&#151;divided the Labour Party from top to bottom as a huge question of public morality, with no little party infighting. As we heard again today, not least from the right reverend Prelate and from the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell and the noble Baroness who just spoke, these issues remain huge questions of public morality, and so they should. It is right that they do. A battery of other issues has also been raised today: timing, costs, the impact of the expenditure on other forms of military expenditure, and the leverage that we have by maintaining&#151;or, indeed, by abandoning&#151;our nuclear capability. All of those are very important issues.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="070124109000003"></a>The Government&#146;s position cannot be a great surprise to anyone, not even, if I may say so, to the Liberal Democrats. Our 2005 election manifesto said unequivocally that the Government were committed to retaining an independent nuclear deterrent. My noble friend Lady Kennedy said that she did not think that that meant it would be renewed. I remind her that our own national policy forum in 2004 specifically rejected a proposal not to replace Trident. I think that that put a very particular context around it.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="070124109000004"></a>The Government&#146;s commitment, however, goes a great deal further than that. Like any Government, ours have a first duty to maintain the security of our own country. But unlike many other Governments, we are also committed to contributing to and working for global disarmament. Since 1997, the Government&#146;s approach has been consistent in reducing our own nuclear arsenal, in working towards a minimum deterrent, in maintaining that deterrent, and, moreover, in maintaining our position as a nuclear power actively working for more comprehensive international approaches on the reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear arsenals both here and abroad.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="070124109000005"></a>I remind the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell, that the Government have an excellent record on this issue: on the withdrawal of the free-fall bomb, on the reduction of our operationally available warheads by almost half, by all the work that we have undertaken on transparency with regard to fissile holdings, and on our work on verification. I know that my noble and learned friend is well aware of that because he often raises questions on it in this House.</p>

<a name="070124109000007"></a><b><a name="70124-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070124109000095"></a>Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean:</b> My Lords, I do not believe that we will throw that away&#151;a point that I shall come on to&#151;but I thank the noble and learned Lord for re-emphasising those points, because they all testify to the Government&#146;s commitment to reduce and control our nuclear capability and to press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced, verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons. All those points are important in the stance that the Government take. I am bound to say that ours is a record of which I am very proud.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="070124109000008"></a>As we have also heard today, many of the old certainties have gone, and they have been replaced by new threats: international terrorism, suicide bombing and rogue states that support terrorism openly or covertly. It is, of course, a terrorism that boasts a total disregard for the value of human life. I was pleased to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, acknowledge the links, actual or potential, between rogue states which are on the way to acquiring nuclear capability and terrorist groups which are committed to using any weapons to kill as many innocent people as possible.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="070124109000009"></a>Many questions have been raised today on the timing of this decision. I thought that my noble friend Lord Drayson dealt with the point in his opening speech, but I should like to press my noble friend Lord Triesman on it. When I was Minister for Defence Procurement I was appalled at how long the procurement process takes and how enormously difficult it is to reduce the huge delays which are built into the processes. Our predecessors in government experienced very similar difficulties. In defence procurement we have managed to get some control over costs, but our control over delays is still very much wanting. It seems at least arguable that the Ministry of Defence and the defence industries have to do more to reduce the time that the procurement process takes. We have been told that the Vanguard submarines will start to reach the end of their lives in 2017 and that they can be extended by five years,  to 2022. The Government&#146;s argument is that it took 14 years to procure Trident, so it will take at least as long to update it, particularly given the more vigorous safety and regulatory standards and the more complex and sophisticated technologies which pertain today.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="070124109000010"></a>Given my own experience, I readily accept the validity of the argument as it stands, but I question the underlying assumption that procurement has to take so long and that nothing can be done to speed up our processes. There are underlying questions about our reliance on particular sectors or companies in our defence industrial base. In recent years, the tendency towards mergers of those companies has meant that a great deal of the competitive edge has been taken out of the procurement process.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="070124109000011"></a>I therefore ask my noble friend the Minister: what will that procurement process be? We all know that it will be built in the United Kingdom, but how will the contractor be selected, and how will any contractors be bound to timetabling and cost undertakings? As we all know, companies are very good at making all sorts of promises when they are undergoing the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1160"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tendering process, but sometimes they are not quite so enthusiastic once the contract is signed. The fact is that Ministers and Governments change and the collective political memory&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;becomes a little dimmed, but company personnel go on working on the same projects, possibly over a whole working lifetime, and they do maintain their collective corporate memory.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="070124109000012"></a>This is bound to be a project that will be highly sensitive in terms of security and secrecy. I therefore ask what real political and administrative oversight Ministers will be able to exercise now and in the future. How can we be sure that the decisions on specifications taken now or in the next few years will not be hopelessly out of date by 2022? Of course, this will also be very costly. To take the Minister&#146;s figure of &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion, it is an enormous government procurement project, and the MoD procurement processes have a tendency sometimes to underestimate costs rather than the reverse. How will the costs be monitored and controlled? What oversight will Parliament have?</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="070124109000013"></a>We have all read the assurances that the costs will not be at the expense of conventional capabilities of our Armed Forces. For my part, knowing how defence expenditure has to be managed in different capital projects, I have the depressing feeling that the noble Lord, Lord Owen, may be right. The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Epsom, took up very much the same themes. The fact is that while complaints continue on Forces pay, Forces accommodation and some of the most basic equipment&#151;let alone really big procurement projects&#151;assurances on this point are vital. I would not only like to hear these assurances from my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor but I would like them to be specific about expenditure on this project being quite clearly an addition to defence expenditure elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="070124109000014"></a>We all know that the fundamental issue for many people is not the cost, not the impact of expenditure on other defence projects, not the timing, or even, sometimes, not the jobs that may come from such a renewal&#151;it is the morality of updating a weapon of mass destruction, a weapon which some people would never use no matter in what circumstances. I expect that the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and my noble friend Lady Kennedy are just such individuals. I respect that argument. I even admire those who hold that view in the principled way that they do. I am glad that they make the arguments they do to remind us about the horror of nuclear war. However, I take a different view. I believe that the nuclear deterrent keeps us safer with it than we would be without it. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, said, it is the certain knowledge of any potential aggressor that a nuclear attack upon us would be suicidal to the attacker. To me, that is the most persuasive deterrent of all.</p>

<a name="70124-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="070124109000078"></a>It seems to me fanciful to suggest, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, did, that if we divested ourselves of our nuclear weapons, we would have greater authority to persuade others to do the same; or, indeed, that it is hypocritical not to divest  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1161"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ourselves of such weapons when we seek to discourage others. It may sound comforting, but it is miles away from the reality of international relationships. Does anybody seriously believe that if we got rid of our nuclear capability, the North Koreans would say, &#147;That&#146;s splendid&#151;what a fine example! We&#146;ll do the same.&#148;? Or that the Iranians would say, &#147;That&#146;s a very, very persuasive gesture. We&#146;ll follow suit.&#148;? Such ideas really are verging on the risible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="070124109000079"></a>What would happen is that Britain&#146;s voice would be weaker, our point of view would not be taken into account in the councils of international opinion when discussing this subject, and our influence,&#151;which is currently very telling,&#151;would evaporate overnight. We would become more dependent on others. Do your Lordships really want us to be more dependent on the United States, good friend as it is? Ours is not always a comfortable relationship. Or would your Lordships want us to be more dependent, perhaps, on France? Frankly, that is a thought that strikes me as bizarre at every level upon which I consider it. Perhaps I may say very gently to the right reverend Prelate, I do not think that President Chirac has the slightest intention of giving up his nuclear capability. Ultimately our foreign policy&#151;our independent foreign policy&#151;would become ever harder to sustain. I therefore applaud Ministers for making their case openly and transparently and for the commitment to a parliamentary vote in due course. I look forward to the rest of this debate.</p>

Many good points have been made this afternoon in support of that decision. I will endeavour not to tread too much on already well trodden ground, but I would particularly like to endorse the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, about how the attitudes of Iran and North Korea would change were we unilaterally to give up our own nuclear capability.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="070124109000016"></a>It is a nuclear capability that has served us well, especially the submarine-borne strategic asset that has provided continuous, ultimate assurance of our national security since it was first deployed in 1968. Let me also take the opportunity&#151;as did the Minister&#151;to pay tribute to the submariners and their support staff who have maintained the Polaris and the Trident deterrent, submerged for every second of every minute of every hour of every day, without break, and undetected for nigh on 40 years. It is a remarkable human and technological achievement that, by and large, receives little or no acknowledgment.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="070124109000017"></a>As I say, the deterrent has served us well and, given our frequently proven inability to predict events which have strategic impact, such as the Falklands, the invasion of Kuwait, or 9/11, it would certainly be unwise to abandon the security it provides at a time of huge global uncertainty and nuclear proliferation&#151;especially by some states whose long-term stability

I do not need to elaborate on that given the perceptive comments of a number of noble Lords who have spoken on this before me.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="070124109000018"></a>I also welcome the decision to stay with the submarine platform for our nuclear delivery. Apart from its cost-effectiveness, no other system can get close to its covertness and thus relative invulnerability to pre-emptive strike. Under the opaque high seas, the submarine on quick-reaction alert faces none of the threats of disruption&#151;such as terrorism or public disorder&#151;that can assail any system operating from the land.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="070124109000019"></a>It is also sensible to continue with the ballistic missile which, apart from the huge range difference that allows the SSBN to lose itself in the middle of the world&#146;s oceans, does not suffer the same vulnerability to survivability of the cruise missile. These are significant capability gaps that will not close over the timescale of the deployment of a replacement deterrent.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="070124109000020"></a>Much talk is bandied about as to why this decision cannot be deferred, especially by extending the lives of the Trident submarines beyond the five-year extension being mooted for the class&#151;in other words, to allow them to run on after 2024. I am afraid that those who suggest such a course of action, including the transatlantic commentators mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, expose their understandable but dangerous ignorance of operating at first hand British nuclear submarines nearing the end of their design lives, at which time they have shown themselves to be increasingly hard, and hugely expensive, to maintain, and the hurdles imposed by nuclear safety authorities become more and more costly to surmount. All our experience of dealing with ageing nuclear submarines that has been garnered over the past couple of decades can lead only to the conclusion that it would be absolutely irresponsible to push the current Trident class beyond the five-year extension to its designed lifespan. I share the fears of my noble friend Lord Powell on that point. I think that they are quite justified. Given that this means that the force will deplete to a level in 2024 when continuous at-sea deterrence cannot be guaranteed and given the 17 years it will take to design, build and make ready a new class of submarine, it is quite clear why a decision must be made now if there is to be no break in our capability.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="070124109000021"></a>It should be self-evident that any such planned break to one of the fundamental keystones of our deterrence posture that is represented by continuous at-sea deterrence would completely undermine the credibility of the deterrent&#151;not to mention what it would do to the effectiveness and motivation of the submarine crews.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="070124109000022"></a>While on the subject of continuous at-sea deterrence, I agree that it would be sensible to explore what our latest technologies can offer in increased reliability, sustainability and availability, and what they might allow us to do to reduce the size of the strategic submarine force to three boats without undue risk to the maintenance of unbroken continuity of a submarine on patrol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="070124109000023"></a>Finally, I also welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s comment that the investment required to maintain the deterrent will not come at the expense of the conventional capabilities of our Armed Forces and what they need. None the less, it is with some trepidation that I allow in this case for hope to triumph over experience. The scepticism expressed by my noble friend Lord Owen on this is, I fear, well placed. However much the Minister may protest otherwise, the fact is that our Armed Forces are totally inadequately and irresponsibly under-funded for their current level of commitments and the defence planning assumptions they are supposed to meet. Now is not the time to roll out a litany of examples to bear this out&#151;I have mentioned many of them on the Floor of the House before, particularly the deprivations of the Royal Navy&#151;but the point I wish to register is that I fear we will see the Treasury conducting some underhand activity in the current spending round to shave the defence budget in order to allow headroom for the new strategic force. This will have a disastrous effect on our conventional military capability where already we are seeing running rife rumours that to meet savings targets, dramatic cuts are to be made. If only half of what is being leaked comes to pass, our forces will be emasculated&#151;a very poor reward for what they  have done for this Government during their time in office.</p>

His final remarks on the impact of the immediate reduction of expenditure really will need to be taken into consideration when we have before us the Comprehensive Spending Review. However, the fact that the major expenditure, as is made clear in the White Paper, will not occur until the period 2012 to 2027, means that it will be on subsequent rather than the present Comprehensive Spending Review that the major impact will be felt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="070124109000026"></a>Today&#146;s debate on the future of Britain&#146;s nuclear deterrent falls on the 50th anniversary of the 1957 defence White Paper produced by Duncan Sandys which stimulated in some ways the first significant public debate on British nuclear weapons. I mention this partly because as an undergraduate then I played some part in that debate, and I seem to have been involved in debating both with myself and others on the subject ever since. Unlike some of my noble friends, I have never been a unilateralist but have always held that my unenthusiastic support for British nuclear weapons was acceptable only if the strongest pressure was put on successive British Governments to take their commitments to multilateral disarmament seriously. I commend what has been done and has already been referred to this afternoon, but I shall come back to that at the end in order to  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1164"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>support the proposals put forward so clearly by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, earlier in the debate.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="070124109000027"></a>I begin by considering the question of timing, which was referred to by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce. As the Defence Select Committee in the House of Commons argued in its report last year, it can be suggested that in some respects this is a premature decision. The noble and gallant Lord has just made the point that in paragraph 1.5 the White Paper argues that it would be &#147;highly imprudent&#148; to consider extension beyond five years. In any case, even if some conceptual work is now to be undertaken, as suggested in the White Paper, it appears from paragraph 5.11&#151;I would be grateful if the Minister could help us on this&#151;that the main gate decision and the beginning of significant expenditure will not occur until 2012. I believe that that is the critical decision rather than the decision now to carry out certain conceptual studies. It has been argued from these Benches that if we were prepared to operate on the basis of three rather than four submarines from 2022, the decision could even be put back by another two years. While I would certainly argue that the current prospect does not create a situation in which one should decide not to replace the Vanguard submarines, the possibilities of global developments are such that it would be prudent not to make the critical decisions before one has to. That point has been made clear by other noble Lords in the debate.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="070124109000028"></a>The underlying decision on whether Britain should or should not have nuclear weapons has always been a difficult one for me. I have ethical, economic and political questions, and I should like to look at all three. Since their first use in 1945, nuclear weapons have always raised very difficult ethical questions. I was glad that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester raised that so clearly in his remarks. The scale of the destruction they can produce is considered so horrific that the normal jus ad bellum, the concept of proportionality, is extremely difficult to apply.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="070124109000029"></a>During the Cold War the existential threat to our society of a military attack by the Soviet Union was considered so great that the possession of nuclear weapons as a deterrent or&#151;and this was equally the case for other NATO members&#151;membership of an alliance whose ultimate defence was nuclear, was accepted. But I consider that one is in exactly the same ethical situation whether one has nuclear weapons oneself or if one is a member of an alliance whose defence system is based on the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons. However, the removal of the clear and present danger provided by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact inevitably means that the ethical issues will have to be revisited in any discussion of the replacement of Britain&#146;s nuclear capability. The case is certainly not easy to make, but on balance I feel that the degree of uncertainty and instability in the world is such that a social decision to renounce would have to be taken with very great care.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="070124109000030"></a>My second concern has always been to do with resources. Even during the Cold War it was not altogether clear, given the effectiveness of the Atlantic

The arguments we have heard today and are in the White Paper for a second decision centre have some merit in adding to the uncertainty facing one&#146;s opponent, thus reinforcing the deterrence. But it is difficult to ignore the arguments of my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, that status might have a part to play. Indeed, in his remarks the noble Lord, Lord Powell, suggested that it certainly does. Again, in the current financial environment and the very difficult budgetary situation facing the Armed Forces, there must be assurances that the significant expenditure described in the White Paper, which will be spent between 2012 and 2027, is not achieved at the cost of the other pressing and immediate needs of the Armed Forces. Indeed, the experience of both the noble Lord, Lord Owen, and the noble Lord, Lord Moonie, of dealing with this from within the Ministry of Defence was very revealing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="070124109000031"></a>The political problems are related to proliferation. Those issues were discussed by my noble friend Lady Williams. I do not share the view that Britain&#146;s renunciation of its nuclear weapons would have a direct effect on any of the existing nuclear weapons states or the potential proliferators, particularly Iran and North Korea. In that respect I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce. On the other hand, the disappointing progress of nuclear arms control in the post-Cold War world has made it more and more difficult to maintain the non-proliferation regime. Although the 2000 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference was a success, the failure of the 2005 review conference to agree any conclusions really set back a good deal what had been started in 2000, including in particular the 13 steps which were referred to. The failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the lack of progress on a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty suggest to the non-nuclear weapons states that the nuclear weapons states are not treating their responsibilities seriously.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="070124109000032"></a>That is why I found it rather encouraging to read at the beginning of the year an article in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> of 4 January signed by George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger and Sam Nunn, calling for a set of new initiatives to move to a world free of nuclear weapons. These are not woolly minded Liberal Democrats. Two former Secretaries of State, a former Secretary of Defense and a former Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee are an impressive quartet. Their first call is for the United States to,</p>
<ul><a name="070124109000085"></a>&#147;work with leaders of the countries in possession of nuclear weapons to turn the goal of a world without nuclear weapons into a joint enterprise. Such a joint enterprise, by involving changes in the disposition of the states possessing nuclear weapons would lend additional weight to efforts already underway to avoid the emergence of a nuclear-armed North Korea and Iran&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="070124109000080"></a>The article went on to make a series of detailed proposals very similar to the six points made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="070124109000033"></a>While it may be thought that the present Administration in Washington will not necessarily respond immediately to this appeal&#151;indeed, since  4 January there has been little sign that they have&#151;there are signs that those thinking about the policy of an incoming Democratic Administration in 2009 are giving thought to some of these issues. That would increase the chances that the next Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2010 could provide a basis to take useful steps to arms control. This is a further argument for at least delaying the substantive decision until 2012 or 2014. Britain should also consider indicating its support for such a proposal and accept the suggestions made from these Benches that there should be a 50 per cent reduction in the number of nuclear warheads that we hold. Such would be perfectly consistent with maintaining an adequate minimum nuclear deterrent.</p>

Like others who have spoken, I congratulate the Government on having made this debate possible and I strongly agree with those noble Lords who have suggested that it would be good to have a similar opportunity soon to debate where we all stand on biological and chemical weapons.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="070124109000035"></a>Too often, from the 1950s onwards, the debate on nuclear weapons has been portrayed as one between those who, however reluctantly, see nuclear weapons as an essential part of our defence strategy and those who do not. This is a misleading oversimplification. There are many&#151;I find myself among them&#151;who, while not feeling able to join the ranks of CND, are convinced that all weapons of mass destruction must be abolished but that this is more likely to be achieved by a multilateral route.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="070124109000036"></a>However, there is a danger in that position. Faced with the powerful moral advocacy of those who support unilateralism, inadvertently&#151;although, it has to be said, not always inadvertently&#151;the energy of the multilateralists can in effect become caught up in a rationalisation for keeping the weapons rather than being tirelessly devoted to arguments for how we can use our possession of them to get meaningful results towards their global elimination. The Government still need to spell out much more convincingly just how, in the immensely difficult circumstances which surround us&#151;North Korea, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Chinese military technology and the Russian nuclear arsenal in the context of possible political trends in the Russian Federation do not make it any easier&#151;they are actively and meaningfully pursuing the global nuclear disarmament objective.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="070124109000037"></a>In the White Paper the Government argue that we have reduced our deterrent nuclear capability to just one nuclear weapons system and we have heard that again in this debate; that we are pledged to reduce the number of operationally available warheads to fewer  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1167"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than 160, almost a 50 per cent reduction since 1997; that the operational status of our nuclear weapons system has been greatly reduced; that we have not conducted any nuclear tests since 1991; that we have increased the transparency of our fissile material holdings; that we have ceased production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and that we impatiently support the concept of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty. That is not an insignificant record, and I believe it to be one in which the Government are entitled to take some pride.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="070124109000038"></a>As pointed out earlier, it is also striking that the NPT has been a remarkable success. As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, reminded us, in the 1960s it was predicted that there would be between 25 and 30 nuclear states by 2000. So far that has fortunately not happened, but we must take care not to provoke it. The Government surely have to face the reality that at precisely this moment, with all the anxieties about Iran, North Korea and others, to tell the world that we are embarking on a multi-billion pound renewal of our deterrent puts all the good work in jeopardy. Whatever the explanations, the message received by much of the world will be that we are, after all, committed to our own nuclear capability, even if in this context scepticism reaches far beyond our shores on just how far our capability is really independent rather than making us still more beholden to the United States. Instead of rushing to a premature conclusion, is this not arguably the very time to be using our nuclear potential and the decisions that obviously have to be made about its future as leverage in strengthening the non-proliferation regime and giving a new spur to the global nuclear disarmament cause, rather than undermining international security by giving an inevitably new thrust to the motors of proliferation?</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="070124109000040"></a>What plays into the hands of extremism across the world is what is seen as the arrogance of powerful nations in telling others how they should behave, even when this more or less explicitly involves telling the world that it must do as we say rather than as we do. The challenge, if we are to win the battle for enduring security, is to build a shared commitment to a common strategy in the interests of the already powerful, the aspiring and the less powerful alike.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="070124109000041"></a>As my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, have rightly emphasised, the undertakings by the existing nuclear powers in Article VI of the NPT, which have been renewed at various review conferences, are highly significant and central to our credibility when we put pressure on Iran, North Korea or anybody else. The White Paper boldly and honestly states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="070124109000082"></a>&#147;We maintain our nuclear forces as a means of deterring acts of aggression against our vital interests and not for reasons of status&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070124109000081"></a>But any would-be nuclear power could see that as an example to be followed. We must be seen as convincingly and consistently committed to nuclear disarmament ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="070124109000042"></a>The old adage is that generals are always preparing to fight the last war. As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, has yet again made very obvious, this clearly does not apply to our present generation of generals, who are well aware of the changed nature of the threat. They want the resources to meet the current threat and they are not adequately getting those resources, as we all very well know. Exactly the same can be said of the police and intelligence services as they confront terrorism. To pre-empt vast public expenditure into the future for the renewal of the deterrent, when we have failed to provide the wherewithal for our military, police and security services to do what we are asking them to do today and probably for the foreseeable future, could well be described as irresponsible. I entirely accept that long-term strategic doubts mean we cannot discount the nuclear dimension; hence precisely my concern for effective multilateral nuclear non-proliferation regimes and disarmament, but why the rush for renewal? Of course, lead times are incredibly long, as I know from my own time as a Defence Minister, but there are questions to which we need far clearer answers.</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="070124109000043"></a>In the wider public debate, specialist organisations, such as the British American Security Information Council, are keenly looking for answers to those questions. For example, by going firm now, what possibility is there that when the US begins its own renewal, we may be out of step? What would be the implications of that? With the huge costs entailed, with so many uncertainties and unknowns, how far ahead should we commit future Governments to bills for work that by their time in office may, by the latest analysis, be largely irrelevant and increasingly difficult to curtail? We only have to think of the Eurofighter. The Americans expect their Ohio-class submarines to go out of service in 40 years. Those submarines are comparable with our Vanguard-class vessels. Why do we expect ours only to have a further 25 years in service? Have the changes in operational requirements not improved the expected lifespan? In any case, is the concept of continuous at-sea deterrents still relevant? If not, what could be the benefits for the lifespan of our submarines? What maintenance programme might be possible to support a longer lifespan, and what would it cost?</p>

<a name="70124-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="070124109000044"></a>I recognise the arguments for the continuous stealth capability and the argument that, without it, mobilisation of a submarine could escalate tensions, but there is a counter argument. The Government apparently favour the possibility, should the need arise, of sending a signal of intent. Mobilisation might well be seen as just that.</p>

Being prepared is a vital discipline. As Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated, being prepared in the right way, with the right equipment, is the indispensable part of that. We are painfully recognising that in the context of our current overseas operations, while the Eurofighter continues its expensive aerobatics. Of course, judgments about probabilities and possibilities have to be made, but I do not see the evidence that all the necessary analysis

On the other hand, I am concerned that to make an unnecessary, premature decision will deny us the opportunity to see more clearly how the future threats and contexts are likely to be shaped, and to build the widest possible political consensus on the way forward.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="070124109000046"></a>Above all, I am totally convinced that multilateral disarmament and arms control, together with the draconian regulation of the arms trade, are central pillars for any meaningful defence and security policy. That certainly includes the nuclear dimension. Our efforts and drive should be intensifying in those spheres, rather than whipping up a neurosis of urgency for a premature decision that could be counterproductive, unnecessarily imperfect or even perhaps a wanton waste of public funds that are desperately needed in other military and security spheres.</p>

<a name="070124109000047"></a><b><a name="70124-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070124109000099"></a>Lord Harries of Pentregarth:</b> My Lords, during the Cold War, I was a strong supporter of the policy of nuclear deterrence, albeit with some spiritual fear and moral trembling. I believed that there was a nuclear stalemate, and it could not conceivably have been in the interests of one superpower to initiate armed hostilities against the other. Although, thank God, that particular threat has passed, I entirely agree with the White Paper that we continue to live in a notoriously risky and uncertain world and we cannot calculate for sure what new threats lie over the horizon. I further agree with the Government when they write:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="070124109000083"></a>&#147;The Government&#146;s primary responsibility is for the security of current and future UK citizens&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70124-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="070124109000048"></a>If I might say so, I am not soft on nuclear weapons or at all sanguine about the dangers of the world in which we now live. In fact, I believe that the situation of the world is now more dangerous than it was during the Cold War; however, as all noble Lords will agree, we now face a very different kind of threat. We need to ask whether there is any possible scenario in which an independent UK deterrent would be of use. The White Paper puts forward three possible scenarios, which have been and will continue to be well discussed, and I do not intend to do so in any detail now. But while the possession of nuclear weapons can, generally speaking, be a stabilising factor, I find it very difficult to conceive of any actual scenario in which they would or could be used, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, emphasised so strongly. I will return in a moment to the question of whether they could be used. Rather than focusing on possible scenarios for their use, I wish to approach this debate from a different angle, making four main points.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="070124109000049"></a>First, as I have already said, I entirely accept that the Government have a prime obligation to take all necessary steps to protect their citizens, and an independent UK deterrent is no doubt an extra  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1170"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>safeguard. But is a decision to replace our deterrent really a reasonable and necessary step, or is it a safeguard too far, for reasons other than prudence? Life in this world can never be 100 per cent secure, and any attempt to make it such is bound to fail. Although we can all understand the anxiety that underlies life and the desire to be totally safe, policies driven by that are a form of hubris; that is, they attempt to achieve that which creaturely life simply does not offer. I do not often bring the scriptures into debates, but the Bible is full of warnings about people who seek their security other than where alone it can be found. This is not, I must emphasise, an argument for taking defence issues other than with the greatest seriousness. Governments ought to consider risks and be prudent, but in the nature of the case, they cannot do everything. They cannot foresee every possibility. They cannot make a country 100 per cent secure, and the attempt to do so flies in the face of reality.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="070124109000050"></a>The question in my mind, therefore, given the highly theoretical and speculative nature of the scenarios posited for the deployment of nuclear weapons, is whether a decision to replace the UK deterrent with a modernised version, to come into operation some time in the 2020s, is simply a sensible, prudent precaution or a step too far, driven by the anxiety shared by all human beings to protect us from every possible contingency. That policy is bound to have harmful consequences, because it is based on an illusory idea of total security.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="070124109000051"></a>There is another point which also concerns what might be driving such a policy. We are used to being one of the big players, one of the guests with our feet under the table, because of our possession of nuclear weapons. Are we reluctant to give up having an independent nuclear deterrent because we feel it would diminish our prestige, power and influence in the world? We are used to being a major power; we are comfortable with it, and it is easy to assume, unconsciously, that because in some ways we are not the power we once were, the possession of nuclear weapons somehow reassures us that we still are such a power. We need to ask searching questions about what is really driving the policy to replace our deterrent, and consider whether realistic prudence necessitates it, or whether there are other factors at work that we are, frankly, usually reluctant to acknowledge.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="070124109000052"></a>My second point concerns the morally problematic nature of any use of nuclear weapons. The purpose of deterrence is of course to deter, to ensure that no weapons are used or threatened against us, and therefore that our weapons do not have to be used either. The credibility of deterrence depends in the last analysis on a potential enemy believing that there are circumstances in which our weapons would be used against them. What are those circumstances? I have already said that I find it difficult to foresee realistic scenarios in which, from a military point of view, they would be used. My concern is whether from a moral point of view they could be so used. From a Christian perspective and on the basis of international law, any use of weapons has to be both discriminate and proportionate. It has to be discriminate&#151;directed against military targets&#151;and  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1171"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it has to be proportionate; that is to say, the collateral damage, above all civilian deaths, must not outweigh any possible good that might be achieved by the use of the weapons. It is good that the right reverend Prelate, the Bishop of Manchester, reminded us of those criteria.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="070124109000053"></a>During the Cold War, given the nature of communism and its evil and the sure stability of mutual deterrence, I could just about see how those criteria could be met, but we now live in a very changed world. What was morally problematic then is even more so now, give the particular kinds of threat that we face. Some think that you can have an effective deterrent system without considering possible uses. There is no doubt that the very possession of nuclear weapons has a deterrent effect, as the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, emphasised. In the long run, for the deterrent to be credible, a potential enemy must believe that there are circumstances in which nuclear weapons would and could be used. Given the nature of current threats it is difficult to see how they would be used, and even more so to see how they could be used in a way that was both discriminate and proportionate.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="070124109000054"></a>Thirdly, there is our responsibility to stop nuclear weapons spreading to other countries. I am not naive enough to think that if we decide not to replace the Vanguard Trident D5 system, other countries will immediately give up their own nuclear weapons, or desist from trying to acquire them. Nations are driven by considerations of self-interest. However, the fact that we persist in possession of our weapons and, if we decide to follow the White Paper, will continue to do so at least until the 2040s brings forth understandable accusations of hypocrisy. We are, strictly speaking, within the terms of the non-proliferation treaty, but other countries can still say, &#147;If they think that it is in their interests to retain a nuclear deterrent, why do they suggest that we should not have one, when we think that it is in our interests?&#148;, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, and others pointed out.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="070124109000055"></a>If we became a non-nuclear-weapons power, at least we would not be open to that charge. We would also put down an important marker, like some other nations. I was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, reminded us that a significant number of at least medium-power nations have decided not to go nuclear, which they regarded as being in their national interest. We could say very clearly that, in the world we now live in, national self-interest does not always demand that we arm ourselves with the latest nuclear weapons.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="070124109000056"></a>The arming of states, especially with nuclear weapons, reflects a world based on a radical mistrust of one another. Sadly, we are right to be mistrustful. Terrible things have happened and can happen again. Yet the world cannot be built solely on mistrust; trust is no less essential. In the fine balance between trust and mistrust, on which international relations are built, to desist from replacing the Vanguard Trident D5 system would tip the balance slightly towards trust. Trust can engender mutual trust. I am not naive; this is not inevitable. It may be very unlikely, as

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="070124109000057"></a>The White Paper says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="070124109000084"></a>&#147;The investment required to maintain our deterrent will not come at the expense of the conventional capabilities our armed forces need&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070124109000058"></a>I find that very difficult to believe. No one can deny that what we need for the immediately foreseen threats are good intelligence and strong, well equipped, rapidly deployable conventional forces. The money saved by not going ahead with a nuclear deterrent&#151;some &#163;25 billion&#151;could undoubtedly do a very great deal to enhance that capability, as the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said so powerfully.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="070124109000059"></a>While I, like the noble Lord, Lord Roper, think that some of the arguments are indeed very finely balanced, taken all in all, it would be wiser, as well as less morally problematic and would make for a safer world if we acknowledged that our present independent deterrent has served its purpose well, but should not now be replaced by a new generation of nuclear submarines or new, updated Trident systems. The prudent decision now is to concentrate all possible resources on our conventional capabilities to meet the immediately foreseen threats.</p>

I declare two interests. I am a member of the Armed Forces pay review board, speaking in this debate in a personal capacity. My long-term interest started in the 1960s, when&#151;I suspect like many others&#151;I totally opposed nuclear weapons as a CND supporter. I went on the marches, but never kept the t-shirts. In an ideal world I would have maintained that stance. Along with many others I recognised that to achieve the return of a Labour Government, we had to demonstrate our commitment to national security. One might call that pragmatism; I would not dispute it. Nevertheless, over time I came to believe that the unilateral approach was not the right one and that the multilateral approach was the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="070124109000061"></a>As has been said by others in this debate, one cannot help but feel that the energy and resources that go into producing weapons of war could and should be put to better uses, such as combating poverty, disease or climate change, as suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. Regrettably, we do not live in an ideal world, so I do not accept the unilateralist argument, put in many different ways during this fascinating debate, that it would set an example for others to follow. The activities of Iran, North Korea and China demonstrate the fallacy of this argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="070124109000062"></a>Like many others, I welcome the reduction in warheads and the single platform. It should, in theory, help to reduce costs, and it acknowledges our commitment to the non-proliferation treaty. There is a real concern that the &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion cost estimate may be exceeded, as the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, so eloquently put it. We cannot ignore public concern over our covenant with the Armed

I hope the Minister can echo the Prime Minister in giving an absolute assurance that this expenditure will not have an impact upon our  ability to suitably equip and reward our Armed Forces against a backdrop of the Government&#146;s Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="070124109000063"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, believes that we can focus only on the problems of climate change. I do not deny its importance, but we cannot do that&#151;and the nation would not thank us for doing so&#151;at the expense of national security. I could not help but welcome the thoughtful analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and I share his view and that of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay&#151;who, unfortunately, is not in the Chamber at the moment&#151;about the six points. I hope the Minister will take them into account during his reply. The points he made about steps to revitalise the non-proliferation treaty are well worth consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="070124109000064"></a>My noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws said that we prepared for war and what we got was war. I reflected on that, thinking that perhaps Winston Churchill&#146;s view at the time was that we did not prepare for war and what we nearly got was probably one of the worst defeats that we could ever have suffered, so I did not quite understand the consistency of her point. She went on to say that the public had been taken by surprise. The Labour Government could be criticised for many things, but not for this. There was a manifesto commitment. I do not believe, as alleged by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that we have been in any way bounced into this debate. Nor do I share his view that having this debate shows a cynical approach, and that the decisions have all been taken. This is a debate of vital importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="070124109000065"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, rightly drew our attention to the horrors of Hiroshima. As someone who has visited the city and its museum, I cannot help but acknowledge that. However, I also remember thinking at the time that I was glad that I did not have to take that appalling decision against the backdrop of the appalling Japanese war atrocities. I remember reading <I>The Knights of Bushido</I> as a young man and wondering how people could engage in that kind of conduct. These things must always be taken in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="070124109000066"></a>My noble friend Lady Kennedy said that nuclear deterrence was a nonsense concept. That is a matter of opinion. The experience of the Cold War denies that view. I accept the point of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, about the timing of this decision; the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, echoed that. Without demeaning his argument, I do not know whether the noble and right reverend Lord&#146;s point about trust and mistrust was not a variation of the argument that if we abandon our deterrent then others will follow. I am not sure that there is any evidence to support that.</p>

I know nothing at all about military systems and not much about armaments, but I know a wee bit about people. I am concerned about the consequences of this House&#146;s decisions for people. I thought that I would be a lone voice in my approach on these and other Benches, but I am not. Others share my deep concern. Whatever the weapon&#151;a bullet, a cluster bomb or one of our nuclear weapons&#151;it is always designed for one end alone: to maim and destroy.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="070124109000069"></a>During the Second World War, I lived not far from Liverpool. We could see the searchlights as they tried to identify the planes going overhead. We heard some of the bombs as they fell. We also learnt of the destruction in places like Coventry and London, and heard about Dresden. Whichever side the destruction was on, it was always destroying innocent people&#151;children in particular. That is the approach I want us to take. We can talk about weapons systems, but what about systems of children, innocent adults and families?</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="070124109000070"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Kennedy and Lady Tonge, mentioned the human consequences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Figures vary, but I am told that up to 200,000 people died in those two cities that August. So many others were horrifically injured. When I was at university, we were talking about the effect of things like the strontium-90 fallout from nuclear explosions. Somebody must answer for the dreadful number of those who have already suffered from this sort of bombing.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="070124109000071"></a>Noble Lords will remember, prior to the invasion of Iraq&#151;to which these Benches were opposed&#151;there was a t-shirt saying &#147;Not in my name&#148;. That is I why I am speaking this evening. Will any decision taken here be one of which we will proud to say, &#147;I supported that&#148; or, in the Commons, &#147;We voted for that&#148;? The consequences could be not just 200,000 but, because of the weapons we have today, millions of people. A noble Lord mentioned this evening that a modern warhead could wipe out the whole of London. We must lead the argument, &#147;Not in our name&#148;. We must adopt a moral stance, and see the effect that any decision will have on children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="070124109000072"></a>When Trident was introduced over 20 years ago, there were still nations we could call a threat. You could then argue for this type of nuclear weaponry. As covered in the debate, however, neither China, France, the United States nor any other nation with nuclear weapons is a threat to us. The threat is the enemy within. That is where we should spend  our money; on surveillance, intelligence and the

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="070124109000073"></a>Is it not also true that any deterrent ceases to be a deterrent once it is used? My noble friend Lady Tonge mentioned Armageddon, and that could be the consequence once one nuclear weapon is used. Some have argued about the legality of war with this sort of weaponry. Of course it is illegal. Look at the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Every child who is maimed in any way is a shattering of that convention. We think of the individual and those who suffer most.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="070124109000074"></a>We continue to rely on smaller and stronger armaments, but are we not giving the wrong impression to those other nations, especially in the poorest parts of the world? They are told, &#147;You must have armaments and spend your few resources on weapons&#148;, whether they be of mass destruction or more limited. Are we not sending them that message? Think of the annual cost, not only of producing these weapons but of maintaining them, and how that money could be spent in other ways; not only on surveillance, conventional armaments and so on, but also on tackling AIDS. In 2001, I think, a United Nations commission stated that &#163;12 billion could offer hope to every AIDS sufferer in the world. The other day, I heard on the news that &#163;2 billion from the UK would break the back of AIDS in Africa. Some of us will remember a campaign of a few years ago saying that the money spent on armaments in two weeks could give every family in the world pure, drinkable water.</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="070124109000075"></a>There are so many things that need to be done, and so many ways we could spend our few resources in making the world a place of hope. The world needs worthy role models. Countries providing hope are examples worth following. Is this not the United Kingdom&#146;s new opportunity? It is not easy&#151;we have done things to make people suspicious of us&#151;but it is possible to win the confidence of the most vulnerable people in the world over time, by our own example, as we withdraw from the brink of threats and destruction. Could not that be our new role?</p>

<a name="70124-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="070124109000076"></a>I am glad that I am not a lone voice. Tonight my own party is making wonderful steps in the right direction to bring an end to this terrible nuclear threat that has faced the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="070124109000077"></a>Last week Mr Gordon Brown was in India. There, you remember, he stated that his great hero was Mahatma Gandhi. Many of us would agree with him. Whatever Mr Brown&#146;s future role might be, we hope he will be able to change that admiration into action and positive measures. The alternative could be decisions by this Parliament that would condemn many millions of people to either no future at all&#151;to oblivion&#151;or a future in which they continued in their present desperate situation.</p>

There is no way we can continue to call on our Armed Forces to perform the tasks that we ask of them with the resources that we have so far been giving them. I totally support what the noble Lord, Lord Owen, said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="070124112000002"></a>I also support the accuracy of what the noble Lord said about ring-fencing nuclear expenditure from the rest of the defence budget. This was touched on also by my noble friend Lady Symons and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce. It is psychologically impossible to ring-fence nuclear expenditure. The Comprehensive Spending Review will produce a total defence budget and part of that will be nuclear. If you take the nuclear out of it, what is left is the sum of money that balances the books. While we would all like the protection of ring-fencing, it is, I am afraid, an illusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="070124112000003"></a>Let me come to the main substance of the debate. Like the noble Lord, Lord Roper, I was surprised by the article in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, which I read more than once. I have it with me in the Chamber and I even persuaded my wife to read it because I thought it was extremely important, even though it argued against a lot of things that I hold very dear and believe in. I totally endorse the noble Lord&#146;s assessment of the authority of the authors of that article and I commend it to noble Lords who might be interested in views other than my own.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="070124112000004"></a>I want to make it quite clear from the start that I am not comfortable with the non-proliferation treaty. I have no desire to live in a nuclear-free world and I am very glad that nuclear weapons were invented because I am persuaded that, as a result of the invention of nuclear weapons, we did not see a third world war in western Europe on top of the 10 years in which we slaughtered each other. I am quite convinced that that is one of the reasons we will never see another major land war in Europe.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="070124112000005"></a>I am also extremely glad that nuclear weapons were invented when they were invented. I am, of course, extremely sorry for what happened to the good people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but compare the descriptions that we heard most evocatively of the agonies that those poor people went through with what the alternative would have been, in terms of casualties on both sides, had there been an invasion of the territory of the empire of Japan. In addition, the deterrent would not have been created. Finally, I am extremely glad that nuclear weapons were invented by the United States of America and not by Germany or Japan. So I stand before noble Lords as somebody who is very happy that we have nuclear weapons. I sleep better in my bed at night for that and I am very surprised that lots of noble Lords do not feel the same, though they do not feel it apposite to say so on the Floor of this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="070124112000006"></a>The non-proliferation treaty is flawed. It is farcical to tell other people not to seek to provide the means to deter aggression, just as we in western Europe, China, Russia and the United States have done. I welcome the fact that India and Pakistan have

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="070124112000007"></a>It may surprise your Lordships to learn that I am relatively relaxed about what is going on in North Korea and Iran. I will explain why. The Chinese seem very relaxed about North Korea; they do not seem to be putting pressure on the North Koreans. If the Chinese, who live next to these people, are relaxed, and the Japanese, who also live next to them, are relaxed and doing nothing about creating a nuclear capability of their own, I see no real reason for the rest of us to get too concerned. I happen not to think that this Dr Kim is a lunatic or a madman; I think he is a very clever gentleman who suffers from a lack of attention, which is what he craves. The idea that he is about to incinerate the countries around him, or even fire a missile at the Hawaiian islands or those off Alaska, is frankly farcical.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="070124112000008"></a>There are some very encouraging signs from Tehran that the views of Iran&#146;s president do not find an echo in the opinions of those who actually control the country&#146;s destiny. There are quite clear signs that, whatever his rhetoric may be, the president will not be allowed to proceed down a path that reflects that rhetoric. Again, interestingly, the people you might expect to be greatly concerned&#151;the Saudis and the Egyptians&#151;do not seem particularly upset about Iran. I see no sign that either the Egyptians or the Saudis want to procure nuclear weapons systems themselves, and the Saudis, of course, could clearly afford to do so should they wish to.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="070124112000009"></a>On the NPT, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who is not in his place at the moment&#151;it is unusual that I agree with him, which is possibly why he is not here&#151;that very few countries have actually attempted to acquire a nuclear weapons system over the past many decades. He identified the countries that have drawn back from the brink, such as Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and others. People are deterred from acquiring a nuclear weapons system not just by the cost of creating warheads but by the cost of a delivery system.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="070124112000010"></a>The United Kingdom&#146;s progressive nuclear disarmament over the past many decades will have done credit to CND. My noble friend Lady Symons listed some of those measures, although I am not sure that she included the fact that we gave up the nuclear depth bomb, artillery systems and air launch weapons or the current proposal for the reduction in the number of our warheads. I part company with my noble friend in her applause for this history. I do not rejoice in it and I do not rejoice in the progressive surrender of this country&#146;s capacity for flexible decision-making. On this point I also part company with the noble Lord, Lord Owen. Above all, I find fault with the utter failure of all Governments to negotiate any quid pro quo for any of these steps. Every one of these measures has been an act of unilateral nuclear disarmament which, as I say, would have done CND proud. I deplore the abandonment of so-called sub-strategic systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="070124112000011"></a>However, I agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester, which may surprise him but I hope will not embarrass him, that if we had to have such weapons systems&#151;I do not say that he is enthusiastic for them&#151;they should be far more accurate, deliver far less collateral damage and reduce the risk of innocent civilian deaths, although not all civilians are innocent.</p>

While he has taken a very small point out of my speech, I suggest that he has perhaps made a little more of it than I had intended. I do not wish to be pernickety but to convey to the House the broader aspect that I think my speech put across, which was not intended to be, in any sense, an argument in favour of particular types of weaponry.</p>

I am very grateful to him for that clarification. Without patronising him, I merely point out that a consequence or an implication of what he said would be that he would favour sub-strategic systems that did not deliver the collateral damage of strategic systems. Therefore, there might be some use for the accuracy that we have in the D5 missile, which I have always thought quite otiose. I have always thought it absurd to put such an accurate system on a warhead with the throw weight that we are contemplating. That accuracy will be much more valuable in a tactical or sub-strategic system of the kind that would reduce casualties, which the right reverend Prelate would favour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="070124112000014"></a>On platforms and submarines, I speak with great diffidence in front of one of my former mentors, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, who, as we all know, is a submariner. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, made a point about the candidness of the Ministry of Defence. I remember very well when I was first on the Defence and External Affairs Sub-committee of the Expenditure Committee being told that we had a 12-year lead in the invulnerability of our submarines to detection. That was a science in which increments were very small and took some time to come about. We were always likely to have a 12-year lead because, as the Russians improved their capabilities, so we would improve our capabilities in reducing the vulnerability of the submarines. When I went back  on to the Defence Committee, after being in government, I was surprised to be told that the lead was now down to about two years.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="070124112000015"></a>Subsequently, I learnt&#151;I do not know whether my information is accurate&#151;that the Soviets were in the lead on capabilities of submarine detection. Such is the advance of technology that I am worried it will not be long before that has some practical defence implications. It seems to me an unambiguous argument for our having four boats. I will need an awful lot of persuading that three boats will make an adequate fleet. Of course, submarines are vulnerable, not just to the actions of hostile forces but also to such things as the breakdown of the refrigeration system, particularly at the start of a 90-day patrol, so that there is no fresh food for the people on board.</p>

What is absolutely certain is that, when we had four boats, on more than one occasion we found it very difficult to keep one of them on quick-reaction alert. Never mind what anybody tells me about improvements in technology; I shall need a lot of persuading that we can be absolutely certain of preserving a 24/7, 365-day capability with only a three-boat fleet.</p>

I agree that if we have only one platform it has to be a sub-surface platform. Of course, we shall have a debate, but I find it inconceivable that any British Prime Minister could hand over the ultimate defence of these islands to the president of the United States or the president of France. Were he to do so, I do not think that he would last very long in office and nor, in my view, should he do so.</p>

I welcome the opportunity that this thoughtful debate has given us to start to explore so many factors. The key decision, to which many noble Lords have alluded, is whether the United Kingdom should plan to continue as a nuclear-weapon state. We have heard a diversity of views from all sides of the House, which is scarcely surprising. It reflects the divided views throughout the country. A Populus opinion poll was reported in the <I>Times</I> on 13 December last year which said that 52 per cent of the population is in favour of staying in the nuclear business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="070124121000003"></a>Like many other noble Lords, I have history in this area, not in terms of being a unilateralist or a Minister, but I have been closely involved with the national nuclear capability since I first sat at 15-minutes readiness in quick reaction alert Canberras with American nuclear bombs aboard in Germany nearly 40 years ago, and I went on to Vulcan nuclear bomber squadrons. In the wonderful days when the Ministry of Defence did not mind one writing books about policy issues, I wrote a book on nuclear policy as a group captain and later, in the MoD in the 1990s, I was involved in the operational and defence programme issues of our deterrent force.</p>

During the Cold War, I never doubted for a moment that the nuclear deterrent was an important part of preventing a nuclear war, yet when I turn to the issue now I find that I have to think very carefully about the balance of the arguments for and against the retention of our nuclear capabilities. I do not share the enthusiasm of the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, for a fully nuclearised world and letting everyone get on with it.</p>

Those who wish to renounce the capability argue that our nuclear weapons are immoral, unethical, illegal, provocative, unaffordable or unnecessary.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="070124121000006"></a>In coming to my own judgment, I have started from a basic assumption that nuclear weapons have only one purpose&#151;on this I disagree with my noble friend Lord Roberts, who describes all weapons as designed to maim and kill. The only purpose of a nuclear weapon is to deter the use of other nuclear weapons. If our weapons are ever used, they will have failed in their purpose. Therefore, I find no great problem with the immorality or the legality of deterrence. In that sense, I welcome the announcement of the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, of the abandonment of the sub-strategic system, which was always a dubious concept. It is good to know that tonight that has gone into the history books.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="070124121000007"></a>On need, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, asked some very important questions that have to be answered. A much more difficult analysis needs to be done. We are trying to assess the strategic situation out as far as the middle of the century. We are not threatened by any nuclear-weapon state today, but we might find ourselves at risk in the next 40 years or so. However, we cannot simply say that because we might find ourselves at risk we must have nuclear weapons. We must also examine how our nuclear status impacts on other states in their strategic assessments. By retaining nuclear weapons, do we increase the risks of proliferation by setting a poor example, as some noble Lords, including the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and other noble Lords have argued this evening? I do not believe that maintaining our historical position as one of the five recognised nuclear-weapon states is likely to affect the decision-making of potential proliferators one way or the other. They will come to a decision based on their national concerns, and we need to use all the levers of arms control and diplomacy to influence them in a benign direction, as my noble friends Lady Williams and Lord Roper argued.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="070124121000008"></a>However, as we have heard, despite the international community&#146;s best efforts, proliferation is happening, limited as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, explained. We have had to add Israel, India and Pakistan; North Korea is on the threshold of a nuclear capability; and many noble Lords spoke of the widespread suspicions about the work that Iran is undertaking. Kofi Annan warned of the potential cascade of proliferation that may happen as a result of the current state.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="070124121000009"></a>I also suggest that the co-operative relations between the five nuclear-weapon states are not certain to be maintained over such long timescales. The Chinese anti-satellite test last week showed how policies can change quite unexpectedly in the sensitive area of strategic relationships. We have also grown  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1181"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more wary of Russia&#146;s intentions recently, so I believe that there are sufficient causes for concern in the nuclear area to justify the United Kingdom continuing to take advantage of its special position as a recognised nuclear-weapon state. In doing that, we must use that special position to work hard to prevent proliferation and towards the goal of the global elimination of nuclear weapons, as so many noble Lords said.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="070124121000010"></a>Having made the assessment that we should, in current circumstances, continue as a nuclear power, I turn to the question of the way that we maintain a credible deterrent as cost-effectively as possible. Many noble Lords talked about the opportunity costs that arise from that. My noble friend Lord Wallace described how, as a party, we have been working in parallel on the options under the able chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Roper. We published our conclusions the week before the government White Paper came out. Our broad thrust has much in common with the Government&#146;s analysis, and I shall therefore concentrate only on where we differ.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="070124121000011"></a>We agree that the deterrent should be submarine-based and that we should make use of the US life-enhancement programme for the Trident missile, which will save costs and allow us to concentrate on the question of platforms&#151;the submarines. We agree that we should take the opportunity to reduce our nuclear arsenal. That would show that we are serious about Article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty. The Government opted for a welcome cut of 20 per cent, but that will probably not be noticed by the rest of the world. As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, suggested, we need to look at how far we can go with that cut. Our benchmark cut is 50 per cent. That is more dramatic, and when we look at what that means in practice, we are talking about each submarine going out with 24 independently targeted nuclear warheads aboard. Does anybody really think that that would be insufficient to deter any future enemy? The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, called for a debate on these issues and said that we need time to think about them. He is quite right.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="070124121000012"></a>In his opening remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, argued at length to justify the timescales that appear in the White Paper for early replacement. I do not want to re-enter the argument about the planned life of the Vanguard submarines that I had in a rather unsatisfactory exchange with the noble Baroness the Leader of the House when the White Paper was launched on 4 December. I have the references from the SDR, the 2003 White Paper and the HCDC evidence that the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, gave on 13 July 1998, and I have an article from the <I>Times</I> of 30 December 2002 that quotes the noble Lord, Lord Moonie, when he was a defence minister, as saying,</p>
<ul><a name="070124121000086"></a>&#147;we will maintain a nuclear deterrent and that means Trident to the end of its useful life, a minimum of 30 years&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070124121000084"></a>We used to plan on a figure of 30 years, even if that has now changed.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1182"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="070124121000013"></a>The question is how urgent the decision is. We do not need to argue about the particulars of how long it can be extended because we need to do some research to work that out. However, one element we can help ourselves with is, if we go with the three-boat solution, which we recommend, and that decision is made early rather than being left late, it gives us an extra two years to think about what to do and puts off the main-gate decision. A number of noble Lords, some of whom held ministerial appointments in the procurement area, remarked on how generous the MoD is being to itself in allowing 17 years to produce a new submarine that works to a well known design. The original Trident programme had to do the missile, the warhead and the submarine, and it did them in 14 years. We seem to be giving ourselves lots of time, which makes making the decision about what system to go for that much more urgent.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="070124121000014"></a>We need to look at the options for further life extensions to the Vanguard submarines. My noble friend Lady Williams quoted Professor Richard Garwin, as did other noble Lords. It is no good discounting him as not knowing about submarines, but I shall not go through his CV. He and his team have done a great deal of work on this. If it turns out to be true, which we do not have to accept, that there is some even further extension of life&#151;maybe not the full 15 years that he suggested, but another five years&#151;that gives us more time to look at the options for the future.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="070124121000015"></a>Why should we put this decision off as long as possible? One reason is that we have to plan for a benign contingency. None of us expects it, but it is possible that arms control will get going again in these timescales. To commit ourselves to vast expenditure that turns out to be nugatory would be foolish. Professor Garwin has a different reason for delaying our decision, which is that new technologies will allow more reliable and cheaper systems. I am slightly dubious about that, but it needs to be looked at.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="070124121000016"></a>My noble friend Lady Miller spoke about how the doomsday clock has been moved. I was at the ceremony last week where it was moved forward two minutes. There was a great deal of pessimism about the possibility of small-scale nuclear use in the near future by some of the proliferating powers. If it were to happen, that might generate arms control enthusiasm in a way that there has not been before.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="070124121000017"></a>There is another aspect we have to think about. The life-extension programme of Trident missiles takes them to 2042. That is when the US missile system presumably will be replaced; its submarines were extended to 2045. If we are thinking about going for an American system, there would be some sense in making sure that we are synchronised with the Americans, so that we do not end up half way through the life of our new system without having American support for it. All these sorts of issues need to be looked at. I do not expect the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, to give us the detail of how all this will be done because I think that it will take months if not years to look at the options and get them right.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1183"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="070124121000018"></a>However, I will just focus on why I think that the decision is being rushed. It is industrial pressure; indeed, that is what BAE Systems told the Commons Defence Committee when it gave evidence. It argued that it would need to build a new submarine every 22 months in order to maintain their design and build capability. I do not know how many nuclear submarines that means we will have by 2050, but it will be quite a lot if we have to buy one every 22 months. I do not think that the Minister necessarily can afford that many. But we are in danger of having this most important strategic decision driven by an industrial demand rather than by the right analysis.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="070124121000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, reminded us of the effect this has on the Royal Navy, and the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, reminded us of how these financial commitments distort the programme. But, in spite of all that, I remain hopeful that despite all the rhetoric about early decisions and the fact that we are going to have it sorted out by March, the Government are not that far away from the position I have described.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="070124121000020"></a>We talk about the White Paper as though it is a final decision. I remind your Lordships that the aircraft carriers were announced in the 1998 White Paper, yet nearly nine years later there is no contractual commitment to particular ships. A lot of development work on options has taken place during that time; and the Trident run-on, or whatever it is, will be no different. Given the pressures on the defence programme, I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, will use his talents to put the squeeze on industry to find the optimum approach. That must include a proper look at what life extensions are realistically possible to the submarines. We all know that it profits industry to go for new build. The Minister needs to have independent views, and that includes views independent of those in his department who go on to work for the industry which is trying to sell him these submarines.</p>

<a name="70124-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="070124121000021"></a>I doubt that, whatever party is in power, main gate will be before 2014, and I think that it could be much later. Perhaps in answer to the delay issue and so on, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, can take advice and just give me one date. When is he expecting main gate for his submarines? If it is before 2014 I will be very surprised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="070124121000022"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, called for consultations. I totally agree. This is the start of a national debate, I hope, and not the end of a national debate. As your Lordships have heard from the Benches behind me, we in our party have many diverse views. We are going to take the policy that I have outlined to our spring conference to have it adopted or modified by the party. I will be very interested to hear what the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman is going to do to sample the opinion of his party. The Populus poll shows that 64 per cent of his party supports nuclear weapons, so he will probably have a moderately easy time with the policy. What will the Labour Party do to sample public opinion? That stands at 45 per cent, which suggests that it has problems. I am happy to tell the House that the Populus poll shows that Liberal Democrats were at  52 per cent&#151;exactly the same as the rest of the

I look forward to hearing how the Labour Party will sample public opinion in a realistic way&#151;and it should start with its members.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="070124121000024"></a>The House will know from what my noble friend Lord Howell said in his excellent opening speech that my party sees no difficulty in supporting the Government&#146;s policy as set out in the White Paper. We believe that the arguments put forward represent the only responsible course of action.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="070124121000025"></a>My right honourable friend David Cameron, in his initial response to the White Paper in another place, said that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="070124121000087"></a>&#147;I agree with the Prime Minister both about the substance of this decision and about the timing. It is a vital matter for our national security, and it requires a long-term approach&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/12/06; col. 24.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70124-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="070124121000026"></a>Our reservations and questions, so far as the White Paper is concerned, relate not to the policy itself but rather to the will and ability of the Government to carry the policy proposed through, fully and in a timely manner. The policy set out in the White Paper will entail a short-service life extension for the present system. Will the Minister confirm when that programme will be formally authorised? The real argument is no longer about the nature and relevance of deterrence, nor is it about the use of nuclear weapons. It is about the decision that this country will retain, for the foreseeable future, a secure and recognised ability to respond conclusively, anywhere in the world, should circumstances demand it. To ensure that, we need to get right, first, the platform, secondly, the missiles, including their launch and guidance systems, thirdly, the warheads and, fourthly, the phasing and control of the costs.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="070124121000027"></a>On the platform, we accept that only submarines provide the necessary security and range. The right course is therefore to build an appropriate number of new submarines&#151;the new Vanguards, for short. Whether the appropriate number is three or four does not require an immediate decision, but it has implications that will need to be weighed in the overall cost of investment. In their excellent speeches the noble Lords, Lord O&#146;Neill and Lord Rodgers, called for a three-boat fleet. I tend to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, in wishing to see a four-boat fleet, as all sorts of unforeseen circumstances can occur, and technology needs to be improved enormously before we reduce the number of submarines to three.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="070124121000028"></a>It has been suggested that Britain should wait as long as possible before making any decisions, so that our future needs might become clear. However, the future is always uncertain and there is no reason to suppose that it will become any more predictable than it is today. The Government estimate a 17-year period from starting detailed studies until the first patrol by the new submarines. We do not think that excessive, bearing in mind the difficulties encountered with the

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="070124121000029"></a>It will be essential that industry collaborates far more than it has to date to drive down costs in the manner envisaged by the DIS, and the MoD must  be consistent and clear about its operational requirements. The noble Baroness, Lady Symons, called in her excellent speech for the length of the procurement process to be shortened, and asked some important questions about how the contractor will be selected, about timetables, and about how costs will be monitored and controlled.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="070124121000030"></a>The building of submarines is an essential skill for which, for many reasons, we need to retain sovereign capability. The Defence Select Committee in the other place emphasised that if the Government want to continue to maintain their nuclear submarine capability&#151;and its workforce&#151;then there must be a continuous rhythm of work, especially once the Astute programme is finished and the Vanguard successor starts. The Select Committee was also concerned, as was the noble Lord, Lord Moonie, that we may be losing the skills to build and maintain a replacement for Trident. The shortage of engineers was of particular concern. What are the Government planning to do to address that?</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="070124121000031"></a>Concerning the missiles, it is necessary to have a ballistic missile capability&#151;because of their much greater range and more certain penetrative power&#151;as well as conventionally armed TLAM cruise missiles, which we have now acquired. Ballistic missiles are the only system that can deliver the global effect at place and time of choice, with autonomy through national and international air space. For the missiles, we should be content to look to the United States in furtherance of existing detailed arrangements. It has been made sufficiently clear&#151;not least in the evidence of the Ministry of Defence to the House of Commons Defence Committee&#151;that a degree of procurement dependence does not carry with it operational dependence, notwithstanding cries to the contrary.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="070124121000032"></a>The United States is already committed to a life- extension programme for the Trident missiles themselves. If the United Kingdom is to participate it needs to make a decision this year, which may be driving the decision timescales as much as the lead time to build the new boats. What assurances have the Government sought and received from the Americans that we will be able to participate in the US Navy&#146;s life- extension programme for the D5 missile? There is plenty of scope for Britain and the US to work more closely together on submarine, nuclear reactor and warhead design and build&#151;as well as developing more affordable acquisition, operation and support strategies.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="070124121000033"></a>On warheads, the continued well publicised determination of Russia to retain and update its ballistic missiles, mentioned by the noble Lords, Lord Garden and Lord Rodgers, taken with the efforts of several other countries to acquire nuclear warhead capability, makes it self-evident that we should retain  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1186"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ours. Can the Minister comment on the point made by my noble friend Lord Hamilton and the noble Lord, Lord Owen, that our new Vanguard should be able to launch cruise missiles with conventional warheads?</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="070124121000034"></a>On the cost of the new submarines, the Government will need to provide a more detailed explanation of how and from where they will find the money. When my honourable friend Julian Lewis asked the Prime Minister whether extra funds would be allocated outside the defence budget to pay for the renewal of the deterrent, the Prime Minister&#146;s answer was that that was &#147;very much sui generis &#148;. I have most of my Latin. Does that mean that the extra funding will be found or not? The noble Lord, Lord Drayson, gave some comfort on the issue in his opening speech, but that has concerned many speakers and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, will reinforce the commitment given by the noble Lord, Lord Drayson.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="070124121000035"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, pointed out that the Armed Forces are already irresponsibly underfunded and must not suffer further from the continuation of the deterrent. My noble friend Lord Hamilton was concerned that the new submarines might come at the expense of the carriers, and I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure him on that point. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, went some way to reassure the House on that last week at Question Time, which we very much welcome.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="070124121000036"></a>The Royal Navy continues to have considerable conventional duties to perform, but the Government are busy mothballing ships to save money. The Navy does not want its conventional budget to be raided to pay for the new generation of nuclear deterrent. I hope that the Minister will address the chilling but probably accurate observations by my noble friend Lord Hamilton and the noble Lord, Lord Owen, on that issue.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="070124121000037"></a>My noble friend Lord Marlesford asked about reusing the existing designs of the Vanguard submarines. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, took a pop at the Liberal Democrat Front Bench and rightly pointed out that we should not deprive our children and grandchildren of the security benefits that we have enjoyed. The noble Lord enjoys taking a pop at me from time to time at Question Time, so I hope that he will not be embarrassed if I say that I agreed with most of his speech tonight.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="070124121000038"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Marlesford, I was a bit confused by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire. I always listen with great interest to his speeches, but I was surprised that he rehashed the argument that this is all about the Prime Minister&#146;s legacy. It was a manifesto commitment and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Garden, that the objective of a deterrent is to deter the use of other deterrents. I also agree with the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, that it would be unwise to abandon the security of those submarines. The noble and gallant Lord is a very distinguished submariner himself&#151;the only speaker, I am sure, who has commanded a nuclear submarine. I hope that his speech will be carefully read&#151;especially his advice

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="070124121000040"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, said, we will be safer with this deterrent than without it, but, bearing in mind the appalling delays with the carriers, I hope that we will not see similar delays in drawing up and signing contracts for the new submarines.</p>

I hope I do not embarrass him by saying that I am on the same page. This is a discussion about global discipline and the contribution to international security systems, and it is absolutely true that we are none of us islands unto ourselves in this system of global integration.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="070124121000042"></a>I thank all those who have taken part in the debate. I was very pleased to see that there is a good deal of cross-party support for many of the principles underlying the Government&#146;s decision. That was clear from the summary given by the noble Lord, Lord Astor, a few moments ago. If the House does not mind, I shall immediately run through the issues that he put to me before I move on. First, he will not expect me to comment on the formal authorisation of the programme. That is never announced before contract; it is a commercial issue. The MoD will certainly take the lessons of the Astute programme very seriously; it is important to have clear operational requirements.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="070124121000043"></a>On skills, the noble Lord sought assurances about what we and the Americans have said about the D5 missile programme. I think it is helpful to note that there is agreement. I will return to the issue of cruise missile submarines later but will say now that we do not envisage the dual use of them. I will also return to the issue of funding, because it must be found. It is quite clear that it will not compromise the carriers. The Navy may take a little encouragement from the fact that HMS &#147;Dauntless&#148;, a &#163;1 billion destroyer, was launched only yesterday and that another is on the way. This is all good news.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="070124121000044"></a>Whether or not the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, is the devil&#146;s advocate in this, he plainly discounts any role for the deterrent at the moment. Either one agrees or disagrees with him, and I disagree with him. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, is plainly no advocate for the devil, but he made similar points about the credibility of the purpose of the programme, and I hope to show

I hope to address all the issues raised.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="070124121000045"></a>On 4 December, the Prime Minister announced the Government&#146;s decision to maintain our independent nuclear deterrent. He stated that we had decided to build a new class of submarines to act as a platform for the deterrent, and, further, that we had decided to participate in the United States life-extension programme for the D5 missile. Finally, he announced that we will now cut our stockpile of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160, a cut of nearly a half compared with the plans of the previous Government. He made it clear that he hoped for a substantial public and parliamentary debate on that process&#151;a process which, as the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, said, started with the party manifestos. It has been a consistent part of Conservative Party manifestos, and I believe that the debate has momentum in all the major political parties and well beyond, which is useful.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="070124121000046"></a>Critics of the Government&#146;s decision have raised issues of morality, legality, hypocrisy, rationale and cost, which I shall look at in turn. There are issues of balance in all of them, as the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, said. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Garden, set out some of them. I welcome the overall grasp of the subject injected into the debate by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce. His knowledge of these matters probably goes well beyond that of almost anyone in the House. Moreover, it is objective knowledge. The noble Lord, Lord Garden, has shared in that to some extent, and he has done a fair bit, if I may compliment him, to re-establish some sense on his Benches that they will need to deal with the diverse views, as he put it.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="070124121000047"></a>First, on morality, the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, tested this ground. I do not entirely agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Archer and my noble friend Lady Kennedy, but I respect their views. Some have suggested that the possession of nuclear weapons is morally corrupting and cannot be justified under any circumstances. They are entitled to hold that opinion and I am entitled to disagree. Moral judgments are rarely simple. As Sir Michael Quinlan has said, any proponent of the absolutist moral argument against the possession of nuclear weapons must argue that, even if a Hitler were to possess nuclear weapons, it would be morally wrong for the United Kingdom to possess a counterbalancing deterrent force. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, mentioned the blitz. I do not know what he thinks would have persuaded the Nazis to call off the Luftwaffe, but I believe that it was our forces and the will of the people of the United Kingdom not to live under a vile dictatorship.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="070124121000048"></a>For more than 50 years, as my noble friend Lord Gilbert said, Governments of the United Kingdom have judged the continued possession of a nuclear deterrent to be morally preferable. Why? Because the morally worse outcome is to accept a real risk of a nuclear attack on this country&#146;s vital interests, which would of course have catastrophic consequences. The Government are firm in our view that the judgment  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1189"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remains applicable today. We see no fundamental change in global circumstances that alters the moral calculus, nor, may I say, do other nations.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="070124121000049"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester, who had generally welcomed the White Paper, spoke in this context of the role of ambiguity. He said that it was ethical to ask those questions. It may be ethical not to answer the questions. The answer may allow a power devoid of the ethics that we espouse to inflict the harm that we strive to avoid. Our aim by deterrence is to avoid use. The bones of the strategy developed over the decades have been well understood by the public without elaboration of hypothetical situations. My noble and learned friend Lord Archer asked what were the strategic purposes. They are to prevent Hiroshimas in a world where nuclear weapons cannot be uninvented.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="070124121000050"></a>By the way, we do not use megaton bombs, as was suggested. That is the point of having a deterrent. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Roper. Given the moral equation here, renunciation makes no sense in the light of the dangers and insecurities of the world or the likely pattern of the period ahead.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="070124121000051"></a>I turn to legality. As my noble friend Lord Drayson said, it is entirely lawful for the UK to possess nuclear weapons, and for us to maintain and renew our capability. The UK is a recognised nuclear-weapons state under the non-proliferation treaty. Renewal of the Trident system is fully consistent with our international obligations, including those on disarmament under Article IV of the treaty. That article does not establish a timetable for unilateral disarmament, either nuclear or general, and does not state that replacement or updating of currently held systems is unlawful. Indeed, since the non-proliferation treaty came into force, all five nuclear-weapons states have taken steps to update their deterrents.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="070124121000052"></a>These are the facts pertinent to the legality of the UK&#146;s continued possession of nuclear weapons. Nothing I have heard this evening changes that. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have been clear in their insistence on more work on the non-proliferation treaty, and I have no doubt that they will continue to be clear in debate. The potential use of nuclear weapons&#151;</p>

Sine die is a more recent decision and is a reflection of the intention to have a stable system that recognises the reality of those who do and those who do not have weapons at the moment, without wishing to see those weapons extended across other countries. That has proved a sensible tactical provision. The noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1190"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Powell, made that point in relation to how others have seen the deterrent capacity. He mentioned the example of the first Gulf War, which I thought particularly pertinent.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="070124121000055"></a>Article VI of the non-proliferation treaty places an obligation on all member states to pursue the necessary negotiations to achieve the goal of disarmament. The UK shares the goal of a world free from nuclear weapons and will continue, therefore, to press for multilateral negotiations towards a mutual, balanced and verifiable reduction in them.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="070124121000056"></a>The United Kingdom&#146;s record on disarmament is outstanding. My noble friend Lady Symons helpfully elaborated on it and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer confirmed it. We have the smallest stockpile. I will not go through the issues of the single platform, the numbers and so on, but I believe that it has been successful. Some have suggested that we should go further and reduce the number of warheads to just 100, with 24 on patrol. I have been trying to multiply 24 by 3 and I cannot get to 100, but someone will no doubt tell me that my maths can be improved. This bears no relation to any detailed assessment of what will deter.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="070124121000057"></a>I understand that the Liberal Democrats have been through a process, but I believe that essentially their figure is plucked from the air. The Government&#146;s figure of fewer than 160 reflects a careful, responsible reassessment of our minimum deterrence requirements based on military and civilian expert advice.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="070124121000058"></a><b><a name="70124-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070124121000096"></a>Lord Garden:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister. Does he think that 24 independently targetable warheads would not deter an enemy?</p>

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="070124121000059"></a><b><a name="70124-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070124121000097"></a>Lord Triesman:</b> My Lords, the existence of any warhead would help to deter an enemy, but you have to have a credible system which is deployable at all times and capable of doing the whole job, not just a proportion of the job that sounds attractive on the day. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, the White Paper makes it clear that most of the six points are at the heart of the Government&#146;s policy on non-proliferation. I want to confirm that. On the proposal for an international nuclear fuel bank, a point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, we are actively engaged with the IAEA to take forward those proposals, although I cannot say what the likely conclusions will be. We must pursue that discussion with great energy.</p>

<a name="70124-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="070124121000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and my noble friend Lord Judd mentioned the pattern of the work in which we need to engage to be credible. We continue to be active on disarmament internationally. In 1998, we ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We support the proposal for a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty and the call for the immediate start of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Finally, as mentioned by a couple of noble Lords, we continue to make progress on the 13 practical steps towards nuclear disarmament agreed by consensus at the 2000 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="070124121000061"></a>Some noble Lords have argued that it is hypocritical for the United Kingdom to maintain its deterrent while arguing that others cannot develop one. It is not, because, as I have said, the NPT recognises legitimately the UK as a nuclear-weapons state and has imposed certain obligations, which we fulfil. My noble friend Lord Young of Norwood Green spoke of the desire to deal with this by multilateralism, which we must do in order to overcome any allegation of hypocrisy. The noble Lord, Lord Garden, is right to describe the proliferators&#151;potentially Iran and most certainly North Korea&#151;as having obligations but not ones which they would change on the basis that they were attentive to what we are doing rather than their own interests. As states they undertook not to pursue nuclear weapons and to ensure that their civil nuclear programmes were under IAEA safeguards, and they have not fulfilled those obligations. I do not think that we are the hypocritical ones in this equation. They signed up to the treaty and they are now actively undermining it. While we are setting an example of disarmament, they are escalating armament.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="070124121000062"></a>There is no evidence or probability that unilateral disarmament by the UK will make it any more likely that this position would change. It is instructive to note the international response to the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement of our position. There has been no great outcry. Incidentally, I have other polling results for the Labour Party, which I shall share outside the Chamber if that is helpful&#151;they are very much closer to the Conservative outcome. There have been three main reasons why there has been no outcry. First, our record on disarmament is genuine and shows that we are a constructive actor in international negotiations.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="070124121000063"></a>Secondly, alongside our decision to maintain our deterrent, we have announced a further 20 per cent reduction in our warhead stockpile, so we have reduced by nearly a half since 1997. The United Kingdom is consequently recognised as being honest about its obligations under the NPT. I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, about the centrality of the NPT. I do not think we should lecture others, of course, but we must try to sustain all aspects of that treaty.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="070124121000064"></a>Finally, my strong impression is that few if any expect us to do anything different. Why? Because very few believe that the conditions for unilateral disarmament exist. We must build the durability of the treaty, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, also said. That must be how we also consider the final decisions on the numbers of boats and warheads.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="070124121000065"></a>This takes me to the fourth issue: the reasons why the Government have been criticised for the rationale behind the decision. The Government are clear that we wish to maintain our nuclear weapons capability, only because of the power of such weapons to deter states that may seek to threaten or blackmail us with nuclear weapons. The noble Lord, Lord Powell of Bayswater, drew from firsthand experience on this central point.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="070124121000066"></a>It is reasonable, therefore, to ask who those states might be. Indeed, this was the first question we asked  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1192"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ourselves, and the answer is that we do not know. We do not know because you cannot predict these things with absolute confidence, not in today&#146;s world. We are talking here about 50 years into the future. Thirty years ago, almost nobody would have predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, or the emergence of the kinds of asymmetric warfare that have taken place. Who truly knows? As the pressures of proliferation mount, what will happen 30 years hence? I think that it would be rash and irresponsible to assume today that we will live in a world which will be completely secure and non-malign, without the need for the nuclear insurance. It would be unforgivable as a gamble for the British people. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, gave us wise, historical advice on this.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="070124121000067"></a>We do know some things, however. We know that none of the existing nuclear weapons states proposes unilateral disarmament. We know that large nuclear arsenals remain and that some are being modernised. So we must deal with these possibilities, preparing for the worst, while continuing to work for the best. We must assume that the international security situation will continue to be tense, with conflicts driven by extremism. We conclude that, although some of it is not quantifiable, we must certainly prepare with very great care.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="070124121000068"></a>I want to say a few words about terrorism. We do not believe that the nuclear deterrent is effective against individual terrorists&#151;I have never heard anybody in the House make any such proposition. The United Kingdom has an intensive strategy for managing the risks from terrorism and the Government are investing heavily in a range of capabilities to deal with them. But we still need to insure against a different range of potential threats that only nuclear weapons can deter, even though new threats such as terrorism have plainly emerged. We need to invest in a range of capabilities to deal with all of these threats. The deterrent can help to deter some of the risks that do occur under the rubric of terrorism. Clearly, nuclear weapons do not protect us from suicide bombers carrying plastic explosives, but I believe that some states may well be deterred from transferring nuclear weapons, or nuclear technologies, to terrorists.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="070124121000069"></a>Let me turn to cost&#151;I promised to address this question. Would the money spent on maintaining our nuclear deterrent be better spent elsewhere? I believe that my noble friend Lord Drayson dealt with the assurance on broad expenditure on conventional forces. I repeat what he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="070124121000085"></a>&#147;The Government have undertaken that any additional investment will not come at the expense of the conventional capabilities of our Armed Forces&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70124-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="070124121000070"></a>In saying that, I know that if it turns out not to be true, we will be held to account. But I do assert it this evening. I cannot announce for my noble friend Lord Young the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review, but I am quite clear about the commitment that we have made.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="070124121000071"></a>I do not accept the view of the noble Lord, Lord Owen, although I take it very seriously. If we believe in a ballistic system, he is entitled to call for the  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1193"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expenditure that would match that being ensured without cutting into other things. But I do not think that we can step from that to a point at which we say that unless all these things are spelt out at the same moment, we should not proceed with the process I have described. Incidentally, we have developed a cruise missile with France, which I am told is called the Storm Shadow. I am not an expert on this, but the noble Lord may well be.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="070124121000072"></a>However, the point about the cruise missile is this: there is a higher risk and there is a higher cost. The ballistic missile system provides a lower risk. We know the system and we do not have to build it again from the start. It is a system that is in existence and we have already paid for it, although of course it has to be maintained and updated. We have opted for what is cost-effective, not for something at a disproportionate cost, in order to achieve the minimum deterrent on this platform. We do not intend to bet at this point on a cruise missile. The noble Lord, Lord Powell, wanted me to clarify that this reflects the best of the options available. Perhaps I may say that the figures on cost have been given to noble Lords. I was intrigued to note that the cost is less than one third of what is spent on National Lottery tickets.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="070124121000073"></a>Defence aside, the Government have invested wisely in other services in the United Kingdom such as health and education, and we are investing in international affairs by tackling issues such as climate change and relieving poverty in Africa. I do not think that this is a country which can simply choose to do one or the other if we take international security seriously. We recognise that the first responsibility is to the defence of our citizens and we recognise that only nuclear weapons can provide the deterrent against nuclear threats.</p>

<a name="70124-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="070124121000074"></a>The United Kingdom has complete freedom of action in this, a point made by my noble friend Lord Drayson. Of course I should say to the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, that the UK does so in co-operation with its allies, and indeed I doubt whether there is a modern weapons system where there are not some components bought in the international market. The debate comes down to three questions. First, do we have to take a decision on nuclear capability? The answer is plainly yes, and the full range of defence capabilities need to be assured against that background. Secondly, do we have to take the decision now? The answer in my view is clearly yes. If we fail to start our preparations now, we will miss the initial insurance premium and there will be no ready way of moving back on to a reliable timetable. No doubt later parliaments will judge whether the world is more Benign, but we need to prepare now or leave no choices on credible defence for those future Parliaments. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, described it as a position where we are dealing with complexity, and he is quite right. But this goes also to the skills point. If we do not start these processes, we will not protect the industry or the skills in it by ensuring that they are available to us at the point at which they are needed. That point was also made by my noble friend Lord Moonie.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1194"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column 1194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="070124121000075"></a>On the third question about the length of time of procurement, I shall make just a couple of points. Seventeen years is the best estimate of the whole project from start to finish. It is one which is very close to the view of the United States and France, and we have discussed with them their own experience of this. I do not believe that it will turn out to be radically wrong. It is right that we should try to make sure that it is as short as it credibly can be, but in desiring to give an assurance to industry, the gateway point is 2012 to 2014. I confirm those dates for when the build will start process, although it is hard to be precise within those dates. But as my noble friend Lady Symons said there must be rigorous control over costs and timetables, which have to be consistent and improving. I am sure that the Public Accounts Committee will be demanding in those aims, and we intend to meet its intentions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="070124121000076"></a>I shall turn to one or two more elements of the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, made an intriguing speech. I believe that he relied on making the appeal that anything which delays a tough decision until it is too late to make it is a preferable position to anything that forces us into making that decision. I do not think he is served well by fantasies about the entire internal dynamics of the Labour Party. It struck me as being rather like reading some of the wilder outreaches of the internet where conspiracy theory is very much more attractive than the facts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="070124121000077"></a>Unilateral disarmament was on occasion cheered on by those people I remember historically as having been Liberals. Sensible nuclear armament was advocated by those I remember as having been Social Democrats. It was a nostalgic return to the &#147;Spitting Image&#148; scenario of the two Davids, but only one of them is here this evening.</p>

How often does the House ask what influence the United Kingdom can exert on international bodies? When we can exert it, that influence is based in very major part on the seriousness with which the international community

I should also make it clear that this Committee is charged only to consider orders, not to approve or not approve them. The Motion to approve will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000015"></a>The noble Lord said: Before I make what will be a fairly brief speech, I should like to say that if the noble Lord, Lord Laird, were not laid up in hospital, he would be with us this afternoon. On behalf of all Members of the Committee, I send him best wishes for a very speedy recovery, so that he is back at full strength before too long.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000016"></a>Before turning to the substance of the order, I should like to set out the Government&#146;s position on decommissioning more generally. Decommissioning is a matter of considerable public interest; it has an essential role in building the trust and confidence necessary for political progress in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000017"></a>In September 2005, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported that it, and independent witnesses, had,</p>
<ul><a name="070124101000311"></a>&#147;determined that the IRA has met its commitment to put all its arms beyond use in a manner called for by the legislation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070124101000304"></a>Subsequent reports by the IICD and the Independent Monitoring Commission have verified that the IRA has undertaken the historic and major step of decommissioning its weapons.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000018"></a>To put this in context, I quote from the IMC&#146;s  12th report, which states that three years ago the Provisional IRA,</p>
<ul><a name="070124101000312"></a>&#147;was the most sophisticated and potentially the most dangerous of the groups, possessed of the largest arsenal of guns and other material. It is now firmly set on a political strategy, eschewing terrorism and other forms of crime&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000019"></a>The British and Irish Governments welcomed the move as a landmark development. The Governments said that the significance of the IRA's decommissioning needed to be acknowledged and recognised and that it was the clearest signal ever that the IRA&#146;s armed campaign was over. This act of decommissioning has not been matched by other paramilitary groups, and it  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC374"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC374</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is vital that representatives of loyalist paramilitary groups engage with the IICD and make the full transition from conflict to peace.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000020"></a>Before turning to the substance of the order, I want to make one final general comment. The order is effectively an annual event. It is essential to keep reminding ourselves of the distance we have travelled towards a peaceful Northern Ireland. Last summer, Northern Ireland witnessed the most peaceful parading season in recent years. It is notable that on 12 July, the Army was not deployed on the streets of Belfast in support of the police for the first time in decades. This is a great achievement, which would not have been possible without the efforts of many hundreds of people across Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000021"></a>In political terms, there have also been enormous developments. Following the St Andrews talks, we are on the brink of restoring the power-sharing institutions with the prospect of the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein forming an Executive. This marks incredible progress and heralds hope for a return to stable devolved Government in Northern Ireland. There is more to do to secure a peaceful future, but no one would have predicted at the debate on the previous decommissioning order that we would have come so far in a year. This positive trend on many fronts offers hope for continuing progress.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000022"></a>As I said, this order is a renewal order&#151;an annual order, which appoints 20 February 2008 as the date before which the amnesty period identified in a non-statutory decommissioning scheme must end. The amnesty period is the time during which firearms, ammunition and explosives can be decommissioned in accordance with the scheme. The amnesty provides immunity from prosecution for the offences set out in the schedule to the 1997 Act, offences that might be committed during the decommissioning process. Most such offences relate to the possession of weapons but others may stem from a person&#146;s participation in decommissioning, not necessarily centred on the weapons involved but on the behaviour that may accompany such participation, such as withholding information or making arrangements with the terrorists.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000023"></a>Section 2 of the 1997 Act, as amended by the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning (Amendment) Act 2002 and the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, requires that a scheme must identify the amnesty period, and that it must end before 27 February 2010 unless the Secretary of State, by order, appoints a later day. The order currently in force appoints 23 February as the day before which the amnesty period must end. The purpose of the order before the House is to extend that period for a further year.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000024"></a>The September report of the IICD concluded that the IRA had met its commitment to put all its arms beyond use in a manner called for by the legislation, an assessment that it has since confirmed. The IICD&#146;s report also observed that the arms of loyalist paramilitary groups, as well as other paramilitary organisations, remained to be addressed. That is why we are bringing forward this order. The Government are committed to securing the decommissioning of all

To that end, discussions continue with the representatives of the UPRG and the PUP, who represent the two main loyalist paramilitary organisations, the UDA and the UVF, respectively. Work with these groups is ongoing with a view to helping them to make the transition from conflict to peace. Decommissioning is a crucial feature of that transition.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000025"></a>The IICD reports that the UDA and, albeit indirectly, the LVF are in contact with it, although the UVF has yet to re-engage. Both Ministers and officials will continue to press for progress but, in parallel with that, it is essential that we continue to provide the statutory framework necessary to make decommissioning a reality. That is what this order does and is the sole purpose of why we are here today. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000027"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070124101000328"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the Minister for his usual clear, forthright outline of the order before us. I also associate myself with his words in wishing our noble colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Laird, a speedy recovery. He will be welcome back as soon as he is able to make it.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000028"></a>The Minister spoke a little bit in general terms about decommissioning. There is no doubt that the opportunity that a decommissioning amnesty gave terrorist groups was a very useful political and practical way in which to move forward in the peace process, especially in its early days, and towards ending what must have been one of the nastiest and dirtiest of terrorist campaigns that those involved in it at the time ever remember. Let us not forget that the IRA campaign towards Northern Ireland and the border was seriously nasty and dirty and almost a civil war. We should never forget that, and our thanks should go to all those who took part in helping to end that.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000029"></a>There is no doubt that that amnesty and decommissioning played a small part in the early days, when people never believed it would happen. The miracle of decommissioning did happen: and decommissioning by the IRA was of great assistance in attempting to demonstrate to the population that the IRA had had enough of dirt, war, murder and carnage and wanted to return to the table and to democratic governance.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000030"></a>As the Minister said, we still have to encourage the remaining paramilitaries in Northern Ireland not to follow suit, which is not the appropriate phrase, but to decommission themselves and put their arms away. Let us get violence of that sort out of politics in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000031"></a>As far as the future is concerned, which the Minister also mentioned, I sincerely hope that we will find ourselves redundant in the role that we are in today and that it will be carried out and pursued in

<p><a name="070124101000032"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070124101000329"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> I thank the Minister for elucidating the main points in this order, which has been a hardy annual now for many years. Every year we hope that we will not have to renew it again and we certainly hope that this will be the final time. I would also like to associate myself with the Minister&#146;s wishes for the speedy recovery of the noble Lord, Lord Laird.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000033"></a>As the Minister said, we have come a long way and the most heartening thing has been the decommissioning by the IRA, which is now more or less complete. But it is clear from the latest report from the Independent Monitoring Commission that paramilitary groups are still active in Northern Ireland and therefore there is still a need for a decommissioning scheme if any of these groups are ever to decommission their weapons. The report was very clear on the threat level that still exists from the Continuity IRA, the Real IRA and dissident republican groups in general. If there is an agreement for Stormont to be revived, I fear that we may see some protest activity of a nasty kind by any such groups that are particularly annoyed with Sinn Fein.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000034"></a>Equally, we must remain deeply disappointed at the lack of decommissioning there has been from loyalist paramilitary groups. That is very worrying. There has been no progress despite endless discussions, to which the Minister referred. The recent ombudsman report shows just how nasty these loyalist groups have been in the past and they are still a threat. There may be an upsurge of activity from them if there is a revival of Stormont, because they too may be against any power-sharing agreement.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000035"></a>Republican and loyalist groups are seriously involved in organised crime and continue to carry out paramilitary assaults in Northern Ireland. The Minister has said that there are ongoing discussions with proxies for the loyalist groups, but can he give us further assurance that greater efforts will be made to get these groups to engage with the international decommissioning commission?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000036"></a>We do not believe that, in a democratic society, there is any place for illegality or illegally held weapons and have always called for full decommissioning by both loyalist and dissident republican paramilitary groups. We have been supportive of the progress that has been made on this issue to date. We recognise that decommissioning is a process and that no paramilitary group was going to decommission all its weapons at once, but we urge the Government to put pressure on loyalist paramilitary groups to move away from crime and decommission their weapons. We support the order.</p>

He referred, quite rightly, to the significant IRA decommissioning that has recently taken place and said that decommissioning is essential for  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC377"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>confidence building. Unfortunately, decommissioning has not built sufficient confidence in society in Northern Ireland. In fact, the decommissioning that took place recently has passed by without making a ripple of an impact on public opinion. The reasons for this are quite simple: first, decommissioning has taken much longer than expected; and, secondly, it has been done in a way that has not been helpful.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000038"></a>In saying that it has taken longer than expected, I recall that on 10 April 1998 the Prime Minister, in writing, stated quite clearly that the view of Her Majesty&#146;s Government was that decommissioning should start immediately decommissioning schemes were put in place in June 1998. It would have been good had the Government stuck to that point and ensured that it happened. Unfortunately, the Government never brought effective pressure to bear on republicans and I am very much of the view that decommissioning would never have started but for the actions of myself and my colleagues. It started, but it has continued in a way that has not built confidence because the decommissioning commission, in my  view quite wrongly, agreed with republicans that decommissioning should be carried out in secret&#151;and, of course, things that are done in secret will never build confidence. Although the Government, through the Minister, have said that this is essential for confidence building, they have not realised or joined up in their minds the desirable objectives of decommissioning and the folly of agreeing to things being done in secret.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000039"></a>I do not want the Minister to say in reply that there was some obligation of confidence in the legislation. It is an excuse that the Government have used in the past and, if the Minister feels inclined to use it, I would refer him to a contribution I made in another place four years ago in which I went through the legislation and the schemes in detail, showing quite clearly that the Government&#146;s contention was wrong. I recall that on that occasion the Minister who replied to the debate was silent on the issue, which I took to mean that he had no reply to the points I made.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000040"></a>Nevertheless, decommissioning by republicans has happened and cannot be repeated. We are then left with the situation that there has been no significant decommissioning by the main loyalist elements or by dissident republicans. Here again, it is deeply regrettable that there has not been progress on these issues. A year ago there was some hope that the UVF would engage in significant action and rumours were put about that it was planning to do something in July of last year. Unfortunately, the way in which the Government&#146;s current political initiative has been handled has created a certain amount of uncertainty and that plan has gone backwards. The uncertainty has been created by foolish comments, mainly by commentators, but to a certain extent by Ministers, about a plan B if the present proposals do not succeed. The uncertainty about that has, we understand, led the UVF to put on hold whatever it had been planning to do last July. That is highly regrettable. We have made the point repeatedly to loyalist paramilitaries and their representatives that they ought to have taken a lead in decommissioning and that they still should act promptly on the matter.

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000041"></a>In this context and the context of the report to which the noble Lord, Lord Smith, referred&#151;namely, the police ombudsman&#146;s report&#151;which goes into considerable and quite distasteful detail about the activities of the UVF, and particularly its leadership, I wonder whether the Secretary of State was wise to speak in the way that he did at the funeral of  Mr David Ervine. I can understand his attendance there, but not him speaking in a way that lavished praise upon Mr Ervine, and, by extension, his associates. There is no doubt as to who they were, because I am told by better-informed persons than myself that the entire leadership of the UVF was there, prominently, sitting not too far away from the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State must have received this report by that time, and if he had no knowledge of the character he was praising on that occasion before he saw that report, he must have done when he received it. I am simply amazed at his behaviour in that respect. I doubt if the Minister is in a position, or even has a desire, to comment on that, but I felt that it would not be right to let the matter pass without querying the behaviour of the Secretary of State on that occasion.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000042"></a>We hope that matters will progress and it would be nice if we were not here in a year&#146;s time, doing the same thing. We do not know, of course, how things will develop, although I am encouraged by the way that things are going and there is a prospect of serious progress&#151;but I shall not speculate further on that because there are persons present here who might, if they feel like it, give us further information and better particulars on those matters. I shall leave that to them. I am optimistic that there will be that progress, which I hope will be followed by loyalists waking up to the reality that their activities and continuing existence as paramilitaries are doing nothing for them, nothing for the persons that they purport to represent or &#147;protect&#148;, and that they would be much better bringing their armed organisations to an end.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000043"></a>As to the threat from dissident republicans, I am afraid that that problem will exist. We have the consolation that the security forces appear to have the measure of those groups quite effectively and I hope that that will bring us as close to normality as we can expect to be. I hope that we will not find ourselves here again next year.</p>

Will it apply to persons in third countries who could claim that they are in the process of decommissioning?  For example, some security sources suggest that

Will such people be able to claim that they are in the act of decommissioning and receive an amnesty?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000046"></a>I disagree totally with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, about loyalist paramilitaries. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Trimble. Noble Lords may recall that when the two Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and southern Ireland met in Armagh city, and announced a plan B for involving Dublin in the affairs of Northern Ireland, the loyalist paramilitaries immediately announced that they were withdrawing from the process of decommissioning. That was a signal for what lies ahead. I do not believe that loyalist paramilitaries would involve themselves in terrorism to bring down a power-sharing assembly at Stormont, but I feel a growing threat in Northern Ireland that the loyalist paramilitaries are holding back to see what plan B will be if the power-sharing executive fails. I fear that if it does fail, there could well be a response from loyalist paramilitaries.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, has cautioned the House about that previously. This is not the first time he has indicated that while the Government currently repudiate any effort by loyalists to move forward, however slowly, they are sticking to the tactic of, &#147;Let&#146;s hug a provo&#148;.</p>

Everything the Government did, however, was to discourage what he was attempting to do. When, quite recently, he wanted to form an alliance with the leader of my own party to move things forward, the Government and every other party sitting in that Assembly, without exception, jumped up and shouted, &#147;Foul! We can&#146;t allow that to happen&#148;. The reality is that for those same people, including the Secretary of State, to turn out to say kind things when the poor man had died is nothing short of hypocrisy.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000051"></a>I am not going to ameliorate what I have to say on this. We must get rid of the hypocrisy that emanates from the Northern Ireland Office. There are some very evil people in loyalist paramilitary organisations. I am totally opposed to them, and I would like to see every last one brought to justice. But when I see an orchestrated event like I have seen over the past couple of days, when I see a report coming forward from the police ombudsman&#151;who is qualified in neither an investigative nor a judicial sense&#151;to blacken the names of those who worked at huge personal cost, I cannot believe, bluntly, that we do not have more guts and more principle coming from those who govern us at the moment. They should not allow the name of the RUC GC to be blackened. The Ministers can smirk if they like, but the double standards and hypocrisy that I have witnessed over the past few weeks lead me to ask whether they would be encouraged to give up their guns if they were loyalist paramilitaries. Thank God, I grew up in a different environment.</p>

Let us not have an exclusive &#147;hug-a-provo&#148; tactic for the next year because, if we do, there will not be a single solitary gun decommissioned. I know that is what will happen. It is not what I want, but I know it.</p>

Where did those arms come from if they have all been decommissioned? The reason the ombudsman has brought forward her report at this vital stage in the affairs of Northern Ireland is obvious to all who have eyes to see: it is in order to let Sinn Fein off the hook. I hope it does not have that effect.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000056"></a>I associate myself with the remarks of sympathy for the noble Lord, Lord Laird. I have known him for a very long time. His mother and I served together in the city council, the old corporation, and his father served with the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, and my husband in the old Stormont. I hope he will soon be better.</p>

However, the matter is under investigation and updates will follow. I take her point&#151;I understand the central point she made.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000058"></a>I could take offence at some of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, but I will let them pass. This order is an invitation&#151;albeit a repeated one&#151;to the loyalist paramilitaries to decommission. It is reaching out to them to say, &#147;Look, come to the table because there&#146;s something in this for you if you can make that move. You can walk away with some success, because that&#146;s what it's all about&#148;. This is not the time for crowing one way or the other. I understand his criticism about other decommissioning done in secret. It is known that, once the process and the mandate are complete, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning will publish its information on the inventory. One can understand the obvious reason why it would not do that as it goes along.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000059"></a>This is not a question of defeat or victory for the parties concerned or of using that kind of language. There is some success for the communities in Northern Ireland in reaching out and using the peaceful process. That is what this order is all about. It is regretted that it is taking so long and nobody regrets that more than the Government and the people of Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, it is important that we renew the invitation for the others who have yet to decommission to do so.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000060"></a>On the central point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, one thing that I can claim without ever having to take advice is that I am helping to legislate only for the United Kingdom. Those other matters are way outside the remit of this order. I can be certain about that. His point is legitimate and I fully understand why he has made it several times, but there is no plan B for a joint authority. I make that absolutely clear. We want the Assembly back. That is what we are working towards. The fear among some members of the community is that if the Assembly is not revived there will be some kind of joint authority over Northern Ireland, and that is not on. There is no point in holding weapons back in case they are needed if something really bad happens as far as the community is concerned. From that point of view, &#147;really bad&#148; would be a joint authority. I have said that before and I am happy to repeat it.</p>

We are not talking about a joint authority. It is easy for the Minister to deny that there will be joint authority, but does plan B include increased southern Irish Government involvement in the internal affairs of Northern Ireland? If it does, we have a major problem.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000062"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070124101000337"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I fully accept that. Please believe that I am not playing with words. I understand that point and I understand what was said after that meeting, but we have been clear about the consequences of failure. We have put orders before the House to enable practical co-operation on the island of Ireland on matters that benefit everybody; whether animal disease control, or the electricity authority. A joint market for electricity is an example of north-south co-operation set out in the Good Friday agreement.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000063"></a>However, the noble Lord talked of controlling internal affairs. North-south co-operation is not about control from the south into the north, it is about what we can do together to benefit our two communities&#151;north and south. The examples of animal disease control, food production, avian flu and the all-Ireland electricity market are matters of supreme economic benefit for north and south. But they will not involve the apocalypse that people might envisage in part of the loyalist community. That should be made quite clear.</p>

On that point, he will be aware that the Irish Republic announced yesterday a &#8364;180 billion development plan and indicated that it would expend 8 per cent of that &#8364;180 billion in Northern Ireland. Have there been discussions, not only with departments but with unionist parties about that? Has that been explained or do people see it&#151;like those who have spoken to me during the past 24 hours&#151;as another stealthy incursion of Irish republican influence in Northern Ireland? It will affect our roads&#151;no one begrudges money spent on roads so don&#146;t throw that one back to me, please&#151;it will affect our hospitals and it will take away the Northern Ireland identity that unionists have sought to defend.</p>

I have come here today to deal with the decommissioning order, which is why I do not know about that and why I am not going down the road of discussing the role of the police ombudsman. The House has a topical Question on that on the Order Paper in the morning which I will be expected to answer, so I am not going to raise it today. There may be economic benefits for investment in Northern Ireland from wherever. Indeed, in parts of Northern Ireland&#151;or the north of the island of Ireland, which is the Republic&#151;as regards the infrastructure and the health services in Derry, for instance, the hospitals are closer to people in the south than their own hospitals, and we have

I understand that investment has been made in the airport there because there was good economic benefit to both the Republic and Northern Ireland. That is not stealth or something to be disparaged.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000066"></a>I will give way in a moment. The fact is that I am now being diverted and I am not going to be because this order is about decommissioning and an invitation to those who have not decommissioned to do so. I had better give way to the noble Lord, Lord Trimble.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000067"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070124101000340"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> I thank the noble Lord for giving way and I know that he does not want to be diverted. However, so much has been said on this matter that I feel impelled to throw in a ha&#146;p&#146;orth. The Minister talks about doing things where there is economic benefit and reference has been made to the plan published in Dublin. I want to draw his attention to the proposal in that plan for the Irish Government to put down&#151;I believe it has been put on the table several times in meetings with Ministers and officials&#151;their contribution to the restoration of the Ulster canal, which would be of considerable economic benefit. In developing the tourist and leisure industry, this is a hugely significant project as anyone who is familiar with what has happened to the canals in England during the past 20 years must know. I hope that when the Minister speaks to his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office he will urge them to see that that bid for valuable co-operation moves forward at last.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000068"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070124101000341"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I will be glad to do that, but I am returning to the issue. Two other points were made in the debate which I shall answer. I do not want to raise the temperature and I appreciate that the Secretary of State has gone round unknowingly upsetting some noble Lords. However, I have to say that I agree with the Secretary of State&#146;s remarks in relation to David Ervine. I had only fleeting contact with David Ervine, but I knew him more from the television over here. Certainly, the evidence was that he was a courageous and remarkable individual who strived to bring loyalism through a transition to a peaceful path. That must be worth paying tribute to in the context of Northern Ireland. On the point about him trying to make an arrangement with the Ulster Unionist Party and the Assembly group, I understand that it was a matter for the presiding officer of the Assembly to resolve. Apparently, she took independent legal advice before she ruled that the Ulster Unionists and the Progressive Unionists were not a party for the purposes of the Assembly. That was where that proposal fell by the wayside.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000069"></a>The order has received a broad welcome and I do not think that anyone will make an indication against it&#151;although we do not vote in Grand Committee. It is an invitation repeated with the  best of intentions to enable the loyalists, the paramilitaries, with dignity to decommission their arms. That is the way to the future.</p>

<h5><a name="070124101000315"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="070124101000071"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="070124101000342"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000072"></a>The noble Lord said: As the title suggests, the purpose of the order is to further amend and update the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, commonly known as PACE, which introduced the now well-established statutory framework for the exercise of police powers in Northern Ireland. This framework is, of course, closely modelled on the one that was first introduced in England and Wales in 1984.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000073"></a>It is now well over a decade since the last major review of PACE in Northern Ireland. In that decade, society has changed radically and that is reflected in the areas of policing and criminality. A joint Home Office/Cabinet Office review of PACE took place in 2002 and there was a further Home Office review in 2004. These produced a range of proposals aimed at modernising police powers. Many of those proposals have now been enacted in England and Wales via the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. As a result, the PACE regime in Northern Ireland is now very out of step with England and Wales in a number of areas, and the order before the Committee today simply aims to address that.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000074"></a>Making amendments to the PACE (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 will provide the Police Service of Northern Ireland with a PACE regime very similar to the one that is available to their colleagues in England and Wales and it will enable them to combat crime more efficiently and effectively in the 21st century.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000075"></a>Several of the changes in the order are of a purely technical nature and, with your Lordships&#146; leave, I shall concentrate my remarks on the amendments of substance. Part II deals with police powers to stop and search, and I shall highlight two of those. The first relates to fireworks. Most people enjoy fireworks responsibly but, in the wrong hands, they can cause not only annoyance and misery but serious injury and death. A small and dangerous mindless minority use them to intimidate and terrorise those around them. The police in England and Wales have the power to stop and search a person or vehicle and to seize fireworks if they have reasonable suspicion that possession is illegal under the terms of existing fireworks legislation. Although Northern Ireland already has a strict fireworks licensing regime, I believe that this power should also be provided to police to deal with those who are intent on deliberately breaching the law.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000076"></a>The other change in relation to search powers will require police constables, prior to commencing a search of a person or vehicle, to provide their name in addition to their police number and police station. The same requirement will apply to the completion of  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC385"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC385</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a record of a search. This is important in Northern Ireland as the police service moves towards greater transparency in its contact with the public.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000077"></a>Noble Lords should note that, as in England and Wales, officers will not be obliged to supply their name in the case of inquiries linked to the investigation of terrorism or where they reasonably believe that, by doing so, they may be endangered.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000078"></a>Part III of the order deals with police powers of entry, search and seizure. In this modern age, criminal evidence and the proceeds of crime can be moved very quickly between locations in an effort to thwart police investigations. Therefore, it is important that we reduce the current bureaucracy associated with search warrants to reflect changes in working procedures and patterns of criminal activity. I should add that the bureaucracy was put there by this House in the first place. It is not the police&#146;s fault; they have to work under the legislation.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000079"></a>At present, a constable is required to apply in person for a warrant which can be used to search a single premises on one occasion only and within one month of the date of issue. Applying repeatedly for warrants for different premises owned by the same person can cause delays and impede investigations. By broadening the scope of search warrants and the way in which they are applied for and executed, the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing warrant structure will be substantially improved. This draft order will allow for a warrant to be issued covering one or more specified premises; it is not a fishing expedition. A new warrant will also be introduced authorising a search of any premises occupied or controlled by an individual, whether or not all addresses are known to the police at the time of the application. In addition, warrants may authorise access on more than one occasion and will be valid for three months as opposed to one month.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000080"></a>In widening the range and scope of search warrants, I am fully aware of the need to ensure that there are stringent safeguards and protection for those whose premises are being searched. Under the new arrangements, there will be a greater requirement on police officers to satisfy a lay magistrate by providing specific information and justification when making application for a warrant. Also, no premises may be entered or searched more than once without the written authority of an officer of at least the rank of inspector.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000081"></a>Some important changes in the area of arrest are set out in Part IV of the draft order. The right to liberty is a key principle of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the power of arrest represents a very obvious interference with that basic right. Arrest is, however, a crucial weapon in the police armoury for tackling crime, and PACE has done much to regulate the power of arrest by establishing a systematic structure based on the principles of seriousness and necessity. As well as a statutory power of arrest for &#147;arrestable&#148; and &#147;serious arrestable&#148; offences, a police officer in Northern Ireland has a general power of arrest, if considered necessary, for all offences, and the criteria justifying such an arrest are set out in Article 27 of the PACE order as it currently stands.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC386"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000082"></a>However, much has changed in terms of crime and criminality and the nature of offending in the 18 years or so since PACE was first introduced, and the current arrangements are far from straightforward. Indeed, they were described by Association of Chief Police Officers at the time of the Home Office review of PACE as a &#147;myriad of complex laws&#148; and there is, undoubtedly, a need for greater clarity.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000083"></a>In line with the changes made in England and Wales in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, Article 15 of the draft order will abolish the categories of &#147;arrestable&#148; and &#147;serious arrestable&#148; offences and replace them with a power of arrest for all offences, but, crucially, one that is based on the concept of necessity. Seriousness will remain a key consideration when a constable decides to make an arrest, but will now be one of a number of &#147;necessary&#148; factors to be taken into account. The officer must consider the necessity for an arrest in order to decide whether to effect one; and necessity requires the officer to set out the reasons why a person is being arrested and not dealt with by another means.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000084"></a>In addition, a new accompanying PACE code of practice, dealing solely with arrest, will shortly be laid before the House. Based on a similar code introduced in England and Wales, the new code will regulate the exercise of the new arrest provisions. The new arrest powers have been in operation for over a year in England and Wales where they have bedded in well. We are confident that they will have a similar beneficial impact in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000085"></a>Part V of the draft order makes a series of changes to the detention provisions aimed at reducing bureaucracy and making current procedures and processes more efficient and effective. In particular, new provisions will be introduced to allow police to review a person&#146;s detention by telephone or video-conferencing facilities. I have also decided to remove the unnecessary and cumbersome provision that requires a person who is released on police bail to return to a police station no later than 28 days after being released.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000086"></a>The importance of identification data in the investigation of crime cannot be underestimated and, as forensic science and technology advance at an unprecedented rate, it is vital that the police are provided with the necessary tools as they investigate crime and seek to bring criminals to account for their deeds.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000087"></a>Part VI of the draft order deals with the questioning and treatment of persons by police, which have been amended on a number of occasions in recent times in line with England and Wales, but the draft order before the Committee makes a number of further changes in this area, again in line with England and Wales. For example, police will be able to take footwear impressions, photograph persons elsewhere other than a police station and take fingerprints without consent in order to confirm a person&#146;s identity.</p>

These include carrying out an intimate search, the taking of intimate and non-intimate samples, delaying a suspect&#146;s right to have someone informed of their arrest and delaying access to legal advice.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000089"></a>I should also draw noble Lords&#146; attention to a new power that will allow police to carry out a speculative search of fingerprint/DNA databases from samples taken from deceased persons or body parts. That will be particularly valuable in the identification of victims of natural disasters such as the tsunamis in Asia and the hurricane in New Orleans.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000090"></a>We were most grateful to those who responded to the consultation process on the draft order. After full consideration of all the points raised, we have decided to make a small number of changes to the published draft to reflect concerns expressed by a number  of respondents. The main change relates to how  17 year-olds should be dealt with under PACE. That age group has been treated as adults since the inception of PACE. However, various international conventions define children as anyone under the age of 18. Indeed, just over a year ago, the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland was changed to reflect this, but no corresponding change was made to PACE. Although England and Wales continue to regard 17 year-olds as adults under PACE, this aspect is currently being considered by the Home Office. We have therefore decided to amend the definition of a child to include those aged 17. However, that important change presents the police and criminal justice agencies with some operational difficulties, and it will not be possible to commence it until those are fully considered and addressed. We have asked our officials to take that forward with some urgency.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000091"></a>I believe the amendments contained in the order will greatly enhance the police and criminal evidence regime in Northern Ireland. In conjunction with radically revised, updated and expanded codes of practice, they will give police in Northern Ireland broadly the same range of powers as those already available to their colleagues in England and Wales and provide them with a much more modern, effective and efficient range of provisions in the fight against crime. But, in keeping with the spirit of PACE, they strike a fair and, we believe, proportionate balance between police powers and the rights of the individual. I therefore commend the order.</p>

It took him 13 minutes and it was extremely well done, but my point, which I make every time, is that this is a classic situation of a Statutory Instrument for Northern Ireland that ought to be debated as a Bill. It has huge effects on the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland and PACE affairs. I suspect it will have a direct impact on almost every human being in the province one way or another. It will have a major

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000094"></a>The comfort, however, having had discussions with officials this morning, or yesterday morning, is that I am as confident as I can be that this is very much a copy&#151;a blueprint&#151;of legislation that is now operating in the remainder of the United Kingdom, which has, I assume, been debated in full in both Houses. I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that there is nothing in this legislation today that has not been debated in relation to legislation standing in the remainder of the UK. I understand that to be so, and if it is only detail we do not have to worry about it.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000095"></a>I was interested that the Minister mentioned the business about 17 year-olds, because that was one item going through with officials that hit me right in the face and made me think how ridiculous Europe was. We have, in moving legislation in this Chamber, to reduce the age of consent and the age at which marriage, buggery, fornication, smoking, drinking and practically everything else you can think of is permissible down to the age of 16&#151;and we are talking about bringing the age for voting down again. Yet here we are, discussing the criminal justice system, and we are going to call live, strong, adult people of 17 children. Somehow that does not make sense. But I understand that that is a European instruction and has to be, and if that is the way it is we cannot argue.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000096"></a>Having made those comments, I support this legislation in principle. It is high time that the PACE legislation was upgraded and updated for Northern Ireland, and I hope that perhaps in two or three years we will do it again because it is vitally important that we keep moving forward and stay in line with the rest of the United Kingdom and&#151;I suppose&#151;Europe.</p>

We understand that it simply brings Northern Ireland PACE codes into line with changes that have already been made for England and Wales. The Minister admitted to a certain sense of d&#233;j  vu, which I also felt, on seeing some of the arrangements in the order. We both worked on Bills that I shall outline in a moment, so he will not be surprised at some of my concerns&#151;and I have more concerns than the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, expressed.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000098"></a>Liberal Democrats had a number of concerns when provisions were debated during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, the Police Reform Act 2002 and, in particular, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. This Act, although I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, will remember, was pushed through Parliament in the days before dissolution, just before the May 2005 general election, and did not receive adequate scrutiny. It was a very large Act.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000099"></a>We have a number of concerns relating to the order. The first relates to the arrest provisions contained in Article 15. While we do not object in principle to the simplification of the criteria for arrest, we are concerned that this article grants too  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC389"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC389</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>much discretion to individual officers. I have made that point before and I make it here again. That will lead to large numbers of unnecessary arrests. We are concerned at the use of the phrase that talks about being &#147;about to&#148; commit an offence. Preventive detention otherwise than for the purpose of initiating criminal prosecution is not permitted by Article 5 of the European convention. The police and others have powers to use reasonable force in the prevention of crime. We are concerned about the general power of arrest. These conditions are drafted very broadly and it would be very easy for an officer to justify an arrest under one or both of them; since officers often have to make rapid decisions about whether to arrest, it would be natural for relatively inexperienced officers in particular to err on the side of caution, which could lead to further overcrowding of custody units and suites and increased use of police time and resources in dealing with people arrested for minor offences.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000100"></a>In addition, we are concerned that there is considerable scope for abuse of these provisions and that they may be applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory fashion against certain sectors of the community such as, for example, ethnic minorities. Article 5 of the convention does not permit arbitrary procedures for arrest. Can the Minister assure us that the provisions will, at the very least, be monitored and reviewed by the Government?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000101"></a>We are also concerned that giving officers the power to arrest for a minor offence could lead to a higher number of arrests of children and young people. It would be very useful to have a system to analyse the effect of this provision on young people.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000102"></a>We very much welcome the provisions in Article 18 of the order, which amend the current definition of an arrested juvenile under PACE from a person under the age of 17 years to a person under the age of 18 years. That will rectify the disparity between the extension of the youth justice system to 17 year-olds under the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 and their continued treatment as adults under PACE. This was in contravention of domestic law under the Criminal Justice (Children) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998, the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 and international standards, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, or Beijing rules, which define children as anyone up to the age of 18 years. It is right that 17 year-olds are afforded the same safeguards and protections as juveniles. We are pleased that the Government have recognised that, although I am disappointed that it will not come into force until some time in the future.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000103"></a>The Minister will not be surprised to hear my concerns about the provisions of Articles 32 and 33 which lower the authorisation level from a superintendent to an inspector for the taking of intimate and non-intimate samples without consent.  I remember being very concerned about these when we debated the Bill on the Floor of the House. I never won my battle on that issue, but I seek the Minister&#146;s  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC390"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reassurance that inspectors will be given appropriate and adequate training in this respect.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000104"></a>Finally, the provisions in Articles 31 and 36 on photographing suspects and taking their footprints are also problematic. Under the present PACE codes, additional safeguards should be in place when the young or vulnerable are required to undergo any intrusive act at the request of a constable. If young or vulnerable people are taken to a police station for those activities to be undertaken, the requirement is usually that an appropriate adult is with them. Those protections appear to go out of the window under the new provisions. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000105"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070124101000345"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> The Minister will no doubt be glad to hear that I do not intend to comment on the detail of the order. I just want to unburden myself of some general observations.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000106"></a>I am delighted that the legislation is bringing Northern Ireland into line with the provisions currently available in England and Wales. That is highly desirable as a general principle. Northern Ireland is a small place; we are not going to generate an awful lot of litigation or experience on any procedures that are operating there in and of itself. Furthermore, most of the media that people consume in Northern Ireland are national media, so their knowledge, expectations and experience in terms of dealing with authorities, particularly on a matter as important as policing, are largely conditioned by national sources of information. They are not likely to be aware of local divergences. For that general consideration, it is most unwise to have any significant variation in the law, particularly where authorities such as the police and others are interacting with ordinary people, unless there are good, compelling reasons for there to be a variation. As a general point, that applies particularly in criminal law but also in a number of other areas. It is highly desirable that the law is kept in step, particularly when we are dealing with a legal system that is fundamentally the same as that in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000107"></a>That leads to observations that I have made many times before and are on record, if anyone cares to look at them. It is a disgrace that the law in Northern Ireland is not kept up to date. Mind you, those who have carriage of this issue in Northern Ireland probably think that they have done a really good job, in that there is a gap of only two and five years between the passing of the English legislation and them managing to stagger forward with their own Northern Ireland equivalent, which is exactly the same and could have been copied in the course of a day or two by anyone familiar with the legislation. But they probably are pleased that they have managed to achieve this. I do not believe that they have any cause for congratulation; in fact, the delays in this are quite inexcusable.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said that this should have been debated as a Bill. Yes, the Bills in which it should have been debated were the equivalent pieces of legislation for England and Wales. It would not have been difficult to have introduced into those Bills amendments for Northern Ireland at the same  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC391"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>time. If that had been reported in the media at the time, when people in Northern Ireland saw commentary in the press they would have known that it applied to them, too. There is no sensible reason for the jealous way in which people in Belfast protect the integrity of the Northern Ireland statute book, as it is called. I know that it is their rice bowl, but they do not serve the public interest in doing so.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000109"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070124101000346"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Perhaps I may say on a personal level&#151;although one is always speaking for the Government&#151;that I agree very much with the thrust of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble.  I found it difficult to understand in the year that I was a direct rule Minister, in terms of legislation, why we could not make additions to England and Wales Bills&#151;not UK-wide Bills, due to the Scottish legal system. There are many arguments as to why you should follow one route or another&#151;I freely admit that&#151;and the Secretary of State has tried on some occasions to try to get Northern Ireland material added into England and Wales Bills. It does not always go down well with the usual channels, because of the size of the Bill. They do not like big Bills, which may take some time. There is also the point relating to those in Belfast who want to protect the integrity of Northern Ireland&#146;s statute book. I fully understand that.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000110"></a>That is a pity, because, in many ways, the operation of the police has changed. I remember PACE being introduced when I was a constituency Member of Parliament. I got the message that it was the way that the police went about their job; there was a big change and a lot of training was carried out. By and large, you would expect the same country to have the same set of rules, so that you would know where you stood and what the powers were. To that extent, I apologise on behalf of the Government for the delay in updating. I certainly apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and others for bringing this legislation forward in this way. We much regret that and there has to be better way of legislating for Northern Ireland and we have made a commitment in terms of devolution that I repeat now&#151;although this would not be a matter for the Assembly&#151;we wish to find another way of legislating in Westminster. We have to do that and it is not fair to people who represent opinion in Northern Ireland, as noble Lords do here, or Members of the other place.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000111"></a>In answer to the question asked on this order by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, it is only on the issue of the 17 year-old that Northern Ireland is now ahead of England and Wales, although as the noble Baroness said, it will not come into force straight away. The chances are that it will come into force in Northern Ireland before England and Wales. That is the only divergence, it is basically a matter of bringing the laws up to date.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000112"></a>The Police Service of Northern Ireland has already undertaken extensive training programmes to bring officers up to date with the new powers and the revised codes of practice. Training is currently being

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000113"></a>I say to the noble Baroness that, where there are changes&#151;for example, from superintendent to inspector levels&#151;those will have to be checked and monitored and proper training will have to be effected. There is a good reason for that. As I said, it mirrors what has happened in England and Wales. I fully accept that such a move could be treated with a degree of healthy scepticism but it is important to look at how it works in practice.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000114"></a>The police are not free agents. The noble Baroness referred to the articles on powers of arrest and, although she did not express it in this way, from the way she spoke, anyone would think that the police will be arresting people willy-nilly. That is not the case. Their actions are incredibly circumscribed and, of course, they will operate under the codes of practice, so challenges can be made.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000115"></a>However, I fully accept that there has to be adequate training. I am assured that that is taking place and that there will be adequate monitoring and a review of these changed powers. Ultimately, this House and the other place can be certain that the legislation will be operated in the way that Parliament intended, and I think that it will be subject to review by the Select Committees in the other place.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000116"></a>As I said, this is a modest change. I referred to the major changes and to the fact that many are minor technical changes, but they will improve the situation in Northern Ireland. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. The legislation will be monitored and we will be able to assess the practicalities and fairness of the new scheme.</p>

Can he confirm that continual training might be needed in the special case of Northern Ireland, perhaps on a six-monthly basis? The Police Service of Northern Ireland is very flexible in its outlook and training, but will any minor glitches or problems be corrected fairly quickly? That is of particular importance in Northern Ireland&#151;perhaps more so than elsewhere in the United Kingdom. I was very grateful for the Minister&#146;s kind words and clarity in his winding up but that one small thing came to mind. I seem to remember in Northern Ireland a reference to the mouse that roared, and I am that mouse, asking a simple question. I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm that point for me, either straight away or in writing.</p>

It has been incredibly professional in dealing with those changes. However, I repeat that the police service across Northern Ireland has undergone extensive training in relation to this programme. That is currently being carried out at district command level so that the new powers in this legislation can be operated in conformity with the codes of practice. I am given to understand that the highest level in the police service is confident that officers will be ready and fully trained. Training does not stop with the introduction of the legislation, but they are confident at the highest level that the officers will be ready to exercise the new powers operationally when they are introduced on 1 March. I know from my own personal experience that training is constant in Northern Ireland, and it will not stop. If I can give the noble Lord any further information, having taken advice, I will write to him.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000125"></a>Other new measures include a requirement for utilities, in certain circumstances, to resurface roads or to contribute to the costs of carrying out that work, and a restriction on certain street works for a prescribed period following the completion of substantial street works. After all, how many times have we seen streets dug up? There is a lot of disruption but everyone thinks, &#147;Well, it&#146;s got to be done&#148;&#151;but then, blow me, a couple of weeks later the same street is being dug up again. That is very frustrating for motorists, pedestrians and others who use our roads, so the power is being given to prevent that kind of thing happening. Maximum levels of fines could be increased for certain offences and a range of fixed penalty offences created, as well as a charging mechanism by which utilities would pay for the duration of their occupation of a road and for overrunning any agreed period of occupation. The public consultation revealed support for the proposals, with only the utility companies not supportive of all of the proposed measures. That tells us we may have got this right on behalf of the public. </p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000126"></a>We recognise that utilities provide services that are essential for the economic and social well-being of Northern Ireland, but we need to provide a better system for regulating the way in which roads are dug up and the number of times it can happen. The order will enable us to do that. We intend to put in place a system that is fair to the people who have put in the services, to those who want to use them and to road users who often face a great deal of disruption. Our intention is not to prevent work being carried out&#151;far from it&#151;but to ensure that it is done in a more efficient and better co-ordinated fashion.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000127"></a>The Government are confident that the proposed new powers should give us a more efficient system for managing street works and that, as a result, there will be a reduction in the disruption and congestion suffered by road users. I fully hope to see that put into practice when I visit Northern Ireland. I beg to move.</p>

I read it very much with tongue in cheek; I went through the Explanatory Memorandum in detail. I spent many years in the construction industry, which is closely associated with street works of one sort of another, and pound signs were bouncing around in front of my eyes. The contractors will find great excuses for getting control of a little more money for special restrictions. I can think of all sorts of ruses that the construction industry could dream up to find

I seek an assurance from the Minister that this will be tightly managed.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000130"></a>I would like to know how the industry as a whole will be instructed; as the Minister said, the provisions are very detailed. How will the industry be inducted into it and how will complaints be dealt with? I imagine that the process of letting contracts will have to be changed to ensure that everything is signed for, understood and undertaken by contractors that have taken on public works in this field. Quite a lot of things need to happen on the ground, administratively and in practice, as a result of the order. Having said that, as a user of the roads in Northern Ireland&#151;I do not have a car in this country&#151;I am delighted that some order will be put in place. It is very necessary because we have some huge infrastructure schemes at the moment. Oil lines and gas pipelines are going backwards and forwards across the country, and when there is more capital investment in the water service, water lines will be renewed. All that will have a major impact on traffic flows at varying times in various parts of the country.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000131"></a>In principle, I support the order. In practice, I shall have my tongue in my cheek while I see how well the Government are able to make the order work.</p>

We support its main objectives to achieve more efficient management of street works carried out by the utilities and, we hope, to reduce disruption levels. We also hope that the proposed increases in the powers of the department will help in a more co-ordinated and cohesive approach to the management of street works.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000133"></a>We recognise the concerns expressed by the utilities companies in Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="070124101000137"></a>The order refers to undertakers, but who are they?

Will it apply to public authorities, such as the Water Service? The &#147;prescribed period&#148; may have to be changed following the issuing of the order: there could be an emergency in the road, such as a burst water main or sewage pipeline.

Over the years, I have seen the efficiency of the service increase, and I pay tribute to people such as Malcolm McKibbin and Geoff Allister, as well as my own local engineer, Pat Doherty. They have done very well. With the major road works on the west side of Belfast, which affect me every time I come into the city, minimising the disruption is something that we appreciate. Perhaps this is the place to recognise that.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000141"></a>The order has 28 articles and two schedules and, as other noble Lords have intimated, it is far too complex for an Order in Council. It should be dealt with as primary legislation by a Northern Ireland Assembly. I wish that when a Minister came with a piece of legislation of any sort he had to carry with him all the paper that would form the paper trail attached to it. With this one, he would need more than the four aiders that he has sitting behind him to bring in the amount of paper that is going to be used. This provision will entail a huge increase in the number of bureaucrats&#151;the people who will oversee the multitude of papers that will arise from the legislation. The Minister will probably guess the question that arises from this, but the provision will also require a huge budget. I am not an expert but, from what I can glean, it may be &#163;30 million. I want to deal with that point.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000142"></a>We all want to see traffic moving easily and less disruption on our roads, but here we are using a sledgehammer&#151;or should I say a jackhammer&#151;to crack a nut. The only costs that I can see here are those that will arise if people infringe the legislation; that is, the penalties. I do not see anything that indicates what the provision will cost. The public utilities&#151;the people who provide gas and water&#151;will have huge bills. It is reckoned that, of the &#163;30 million, the Water Service will probably have &#163;15 million extra to pay. That is the advice I have had. Has that been budgeted for by the Water Service? What is going to   


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC397"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC397</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>happen in that regard? How will it retrieve its expenditure? Will that cost be added on to the already, for some of us, alarming cost for water?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000143"></a>People whom I have talked to within the public utilities have indicated that they had not been made aware of some of the issues or that they had not been consulted to the extent that they would have liked. Have provisions been made within the budget of the Water Service for these costs? Will the water consumer now pay for street works as well as water usage? Did consultation on water charging include this issue of additional costs arising from street works? Has the General Consumer Council offered a view on water customers paying extra charges to cover street works? Of course, I could repeat those same questions for the provision of gas or communication services of whatever sort.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000144"></a>It is important that the Minister gives us considerably more information. Ideally, I should love him to say at the end of this debate that he will take the legislation back and that we will deal with it in the Assembly as a proper piece of legislation. But I know that he is not going to do that.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000145"></a>Before I leave that point, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to an Irish news story today, which indicates that the increased costs could add &#163;80 on to household bills as a result of the legislation.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000146"></a>There are other aspects of the order that I cannot understand. We know that we can cut a nice clean track in the road by sawing it&#151;we do not dig it up any more&#151;and that it is easily replaced. It is important that repairs are done efficiently, but why would we impose on the utilities the need to resurface the entire road? How would that be decided? I can see that it could happen but at who&#146;s whim? I do not think that there is anything in the legislation to indicate how it would be done. If you dig a track in the road, put in a sewer, fill it in and top it off, it does not matter that you have repaired the entire width of the road. The important place that needs to be inspected and reinspected will be where the track was, because with the settling of ground and so on it may need to be resurfaced on more than one occasion. So what is the sense in saying that the whole road must be resurfaced?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000147"></a>If I had any reassurance that there was a fixed lifespan for every major or A-class road between normal resurfacing, where one could see where damage had been done, then, depending on the length of time until the next major resurfacing, a charge might be suitable. But would it not be nonsense to ask the utility companies to resurface a road now if the road was to be completely resurfaced by the road service in spring or early summer of this year? Nothing in the order appears to indicate partnership. It seems that the public utility companies, including the water service and gas suppliers, are being penalised.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000148"></a>What about the private developers&#151;the people who really disrupt traffic? Where are they catered for here? How are they to pay part of the charges? I may be wrong, and the Minister may be able to reassure me, but I see absolutely nothing in terms of provision for private developers. Why are they not asked to bear

Perhaps it is because this legislation has been put together in such a complex way that it would be virtually impossible to police every private development. That may be the answer but it is not good enough and it gives me concern.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000149"></a>Without wishing to offend the Minister, although I have done that already, there are things in the legislation to which I would refer as nonsense. The idea that someone with a bowler hat and rolled umbrella can come along and tell the engineer, &#147;Take your apparatus from that road. It is a main street. Put it down that side street&#148;, is&#151;</p>

This really is a matter for consideration. If we employ professionals, we require them to have properly trained people who should come along and say, &#147;You must move your equipment off-site because it may cause a diversion&#148;.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000152"></a>Those are some of the questions that I must ask about this legislation. I should like to know whether there is a schedule of road works, because that would have an impact. If there were a fixed schedule of works for a class of road, one would be able to consider this legislation in a slightly different light. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that this will not be, as I suspect it will be&#151;and as I think he suspects it will be&#151;a bureaucratic nightmare.</p>

The Department for Regional Development is responsible for carrying out most of the work on our roads, and I understand that this legislation does not apply to the road services. Having chaired meetings in Belfast regarding the likely disruption that the Westlink would have caused to the city, and having chaired Making Belfast Work, which brought together all the statutory agencies&#151;transport, water, sewerage and roads&#151;I am pleased to say that we were able to obtain a co-ordinated plan that, in general, alleviated some of the concerns that Belfast traders had over the potential disruption that could have been caused. So, I praise the road services and the Minister for bringing that about.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000154"></a>There are some concerns, however, that this  would cost the utilities somewhere in the region of &#163;15 million, as has been mentioned, while the Government say it would only be &#163;7 million. I hope this discrepancy will not be passed on to taxpayers. Under the reform of local government, the responsibility for local roads will return to local authorities. I hope the money necessary to maintain our roads at a high standard will also transfer over. Those are a few of the difficulties I have but in general I welcome this order.</p>

My visits there are not very frequent. I was there on the first weekend in January and before that on the first weekend in December. I was going to say that whoever has planned the infrastructure, it will be a man in a bowler hat&#151;and there is nothing wrong with a professional engineer wearing a bowler hat, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis.</p>

Some of them are women&#151;even in Northern Ireland, I suspect. It might even be a woman who has organised this. My visits are less frequent than they used to be, but whoever has planned the timing and co-ordination of those massive infrastructure works in Belfast deserves a medal. It has been quite remarkable to watch, as I have done over the past 18 months or so during my visits there. Yet all we had from the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, was a whinge against bureaucrats who he thought could not organise things. Here is a classic example of something that has been really well organised.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000158"></a>The noble Lord has asked a series of legitimate questions.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000159"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070124101000364"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> I am flattered.</p>

If there are any emergencies, as one noble Lord asked, there is a provision for works to be classified as &#147;immediate activities&#148;. Utilities would not be required to give permits for emergency work, but, within two hours of starting work, they would need to tell the roads authority that they were on the job. That is not unreasonable.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000161"></a>We have had a lot of figures bandied about. The order will not come fully into force for quite a while because of the work that has to be done following the original legislation, but less congestion will be a benefit. You cannot put a cost on congestion, although economists attempt to do so when we are looking at new roads and so on. The cost of congestion is an enormous figure over a year, but it is difficult to say how it affects the individual wallet. However, all utilities, private or public, are regulated, and it would be up to the regulator to ensure that the costs passed on to the customer were consistent and that the customer was not simply ripped off.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000162"></a>I shall answer noble Lords&#146; specific questions in no particular order. Where a department intended to resurface a road, there would be a plan for that. There would be a programme of works, depending on the budget that was allocated. These things are not done willy-nilly; they have to be planned months, and in some cases years, in advance. The utilities might be asked to contribute towards the cost where they have been active in the excavations.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000163"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, referred to private developers&#151;presumably of housing or office blocks&#151;who may be building or be required to build roads and access as part of the planning gain or planning permission. They will be required to put in and pay for the road infrastructure as part of the development, but they are not going around digging up the road for repairs. Essentially, we are talking about the utilities&#151;the undertakers with responsibility for water, gas, electricity, telephone lines or perhaps TV cables. We are referring to all those things that are under the road or cross the road and may need repairing or upgrading from time to time.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000164"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="070124101000366"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> I think the Minister misunderstood me. I was talking about occasions when private developers need to get access to existing sewers and other services. That happens quite frequently. In fact, unless it is an entirely new development with its own new infrastructure, such access will be required. Even then, that new infrastructure is often conjoined with something that already exists.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000165"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="070124101000367"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> That is a fair point. I misunderstood the question. The answer to that point may just have been handed to me. The provisions of the draft order will not be applied to other works on streets&#151;for example, road works or work carried out by private developers. The order will apply only to street works because work carried out by others in streets is controlled by separate legislation. It would not be appropriate to use street-work legislation to apply the provisions of the order to those parties.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000166"></a>When resources become available, the department proposes to review legislation concerning the works of private developers and others outside street works on roads and to introduce appropriate measures to control them better. In other words, we would need to look at other legislation. The noble Lord makes a fair point and I am sorry that I misunderstood his original question.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000167"></a>The figure of &#163;80 was raised in relation to individual household bills. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, referred to an Irish news article in that regard. At the moment, it is impossible to say what extra costs will be added to utility bills. That will not be known until the regulations and codes of practice are developed in consultation with the utility companies. There is quite a bit of work to be done once this legislation gets on to the statute book. It will not happen overnight but will take a couple of years. A regulatory impact assessment will also be provided at that stage to ensure that the measures are good value for money.</p>

This will be the legislation, and then we will see what it costs the average household&#148;. Targeting social need was supposed to be one of the platforms that this Government stood on with regard to the electorate. I worry about &#163;80 or &#163;100 per annum being added to the bills of the poorest households.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000169"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="070124101000369"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Frankly, that is unreasonable and scaremongering. This is partly enabling legislation. It gives powers for getting the permits and then, once they are secured, for consultation about the phasing and implementation of the measure. There is consultation with those affected, including the utilities which need to dig up the roads to replace or upgrade their services, a regulatory impact assessment and discussions with the regulators of the various utilities&#151;gas, electricity and water&#151;about how they will ensure that the public are not ripped off by costs being added to the bills. That seems to me to be good governance. Saying, &#147;We&#146;ve got all the answers; here is a piece of legislation&#148;, is crazy when the evidence from the past indicates that that would not be the case.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000170"></a>It is wholly reasonable to take this approach. It is scaremongering of the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, to bandy about increases of &#163;80 or &#163;100 being imposed on the poorest people in Northern Ireland. No such figures have been produced by anyone of repute. They cannot do so because we have not yet gone through the regulatory impact assessment.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000171"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, asked about the prescribed period. I am not sure that I have the cart before the horse. This refers to a prescribed period in which roads authorities can say that the road has been dug up a couple of times recently and there must be a moratorium before someone else comes along after a short period of time. The prescribed period for which a restriction on works may be imposed would be in the regulations. These will be developed with the involvement of the utilities. We need some regulatory authority through the Northern Ireland Road Authority and Utilities Committee. Prescribed periods could be between six months and three to five years depending on the type of road. So we are saying in advance to people who use the road that they have suffered a lot of disruption but, unless there is an emergency, there will be no more permits for work on that road for a period of time. That would be good for business as well as for commuters.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000172"></a>The figure I have on costs, according to the initial estimate, is that the permit scheme could cost all the utilities around &#163;7 million annually, but work has to develop to determine the level of fees and how they are going to be set. That is some way down the road. By the way, I should like to think that a Northern Ireland Minister in the Assembly will be answering to Members in the Assembly on the way in which the detail is brought in. Clearly, that would be much more satisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000173"></a>I was asked who the undertakers were. They are Phoenix Gas, Northern Ireland Electricity, the Water Service and other people who place apparatus in or under the streets. The Water Service will be a government-owned company from April, but this is

I know that I should not have said that because I am making a rod for my own back.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000174"></a>Detailed provisions will come through in regulations. We have to contain costs; it is not a free for all. If the roads people say to utilities that they cannot close the whole road but can only work on one lane, or we want the work done between midnight and 6 am, for example, their staff will be paid more to do that in overtime. But, if that reduces the overall congestion and disruption to people&#146;s lives, a public good comes from that.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000175"></a>The utilities were fully consulted during the consultations on the policy proposals in 2005 and on the proposals for the draft order in 2006. In November last year officials met representatives of the Private Utilities Group&#151;seven utility companies that formed an alliance to lobby against the department&#146;s proposals to discuss their concern. Officials have been asked to continue in consultation with the utilities in developing working practices for implementing the new measures. As the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said, it has to be a partnership; it will not work if there is war between the utilities and the authorities. Doing this in partnership would be seen as a valuable contribution to the lives of the people in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000179"></a>The noble Lord said: The draft order was laid before the House on 27 November. I would first like to provide some background to what I hope will be accepted is a relatively simple order. In Northern Ireland, the boundaries of local government districts and the number and boundaries of the wards into which each district is divided are drawn up by a Local Government Boundaries Commissioner. The role of the District Electoral Areas Commissioner is to group the wards into multi-member constituencies or district electoral areas for the purposes of local elections in Northern Ireland.</p>

The relevant unit for electoral purposes now is the district electoral area. Why preserve the ward, which ceased to have significance more than 40 years ago but still lives on for no good purpose? It results in DEAs being drawn up in an awkward way.</p>

If I had my way we would be doing the same in England, but I am not getting my way at the moment. The wards are the electoral unit with which the vast majority of people are most familiar.</p>

They are identifiable if one focuses on the natural settlement of an area. The current ward structure has been the electoral unit which the vast majority of voters are most familiar with. It is a useful mechanism for ensuring proper representation of the rural and urban electorate within a council area. Some statistical measures such as deprivation are commonly presented and broken down at ward level. One of the ways in which they are most useful is in collecting and publishing statistics. We have gone beyond ward areas now to look at very small areas.</p>

On the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, when the Assembly is back, it will be in charge of local government, in effect. It will be able to make the rules, do what is necessary and make any changes. At present, it is not there and we have to make a modest change, which I can explain in a page and a half&#151;I have only managed to get the first line out so far&#151;about why we have this situation.</p>

The role of the District Electoral Areas Commissioner, which this order is about, is to group the wards into multi-member constituencies or district electoral areas for the purposes of the local elections in Northern Ireland, which are run differently from the rest of Great Britain.

<p><a name="070124101000190"></a>This is an incredibly modest piece of legislation that is necessary simply because of what is intended for local government change in Northern Ireland. The changes have been set in motion. The date on which the new local government structure will come into being is broadly known and we want to ensure that there is no unnecessary gap between when the Local Government Boundary Commission reports and when the wards are grouped together into the multi-member constituency areas for the purposes of the election. That is the only purpose of the order. I will sit down on this point: this process was followed on the two previous occasions that a district electoral areas commissioner was appointed&#151;in 1992 and 1984. This is not a new process. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000196"></a>On the general principle of the same person having two different commission responsibilities&#151;the district electoral area and the local government boundary area&#151;I understand that the Local Government Boundary Commissioner is in the process of deciding the boundaries of the wards. Has he completed his work and when is he likely to report to the Government? I understand that the Government are expediting the work of the District Electoral Area Commissioner. I noticed in the press recently that, at a public hearing in the north-west of Northern Ireland, the people of Strabane, who have always been connected with Omagh, objected because they had been recommended to join with Londonderry. They want to stay with Omagh as they have been  for decades. The Local Government Boundaries

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000197"></a>I also wanted to ask about the District Electoral Area Commissioner and his designation of electoral areas. Under this order, he can group between five and seven of the wards together in one electoral area. Since we will now have only seven councils in Northern Ireland, it means that we will have much larger areas than we have been used to. We have 26 councils, as the Minister well knows. Now we will have only seven and they will cover a much greater part of Northern Ireland than previously. I think there are 50 wards in each area. If you group them together in fives, it means a maximum of just 70 councillors in Northern Ireland. If you group them together in sevens, which is possible under the order, it means a maximum of only 50 councillors in the whole of Northern Ireland, if my arithmetic is correct. I am talking about electoral wards, but I said councillors. Let me start again.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000198"></a>If you have five wards grouped together in an electoral area and there are seven district councils, there will be a total of 70 groups only in Northern Ireland. If you have 50 district areas and seven of them are grouped together at a time, that is 49, roughly speaking. If these areas are going to be so big&#151;we already know that the district council areas will be big because there are only seven instead of 26&#151;and if you now put seven wards together in one district area, there will be a councillor, elected by proportional representation, representing a massive part of the council area. I am worried that councillors will not be local to the people in Northern Ireland if they are in a council representing a massive part of Northern Ireland and are also representing a very large part of that council area.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000199"></a>The commissioner needs to be careful that, where possible, he curtails the number of wards being amalgamated to the minimum of five and not the maximum of seven to ensure that there is some locality in representation by elected councillors. I know that the order is being rushed through and I suspect the reasons for it, but the seven councils are apparently confirmed for Northern Ireland. This was disputed by most of the political parties in Northern Ireland&#151;the argument was that it was balkanisation. I did not necessarily accept that argument, even though my own party said it, because Northern Ireland is balkanised in any case, no matter what you do. Whether there are 26 councils or seven, it will be balkanised, and that cannot be avoided.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000200"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070124101000383"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Chickens sometimes come home to roost quicker than you think. I take personal ministerial responsibility for the decision to reduce the 26 councils to seven, along with my ministerial colleagues. We had a very good and long debate on that issue on two occasions in Grand Committee, when the order went through setting up the boundary commissioner. I cannot go down that road today, although I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord

I originally thought he was saying that there would be only 50 councillors in Northern Ireland. There are 582 at present. There is a degree of latitude for the boundary commissioner. In other words, we did not fix the maximum for each council at a precise number but provided a degree of latitude. I fully accept that there will be fewer councillors than there are now and their electoral area will be slightly&#151;not massively&#151;larger. There is a degree of flexibility as to the number of councillors per local authority; they will not all necessarily be exactly the same.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000201"></a>The Local Government Boundaries Commissioner&#146;s final report is due to be presented on 31 May this year. Parliament has appointed the commissioner to do this job professionally. We do not seek to interfere and I do not want to second-guess the report. A series of public meetings will be held in each of the seven new districts in January and February to allow interested parties to make oral representations on the provisional recommendations which were published in November last year.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000202"></a>The final hearing is expected to close on 9 February. The commission&#146;s procedures require it to take into consideration any representations, and it may subsequently revise its provisional recommendations and publish a final recommendation.

It is the intention to have the elections some time before April 2009 so that the shadow authority can take some pretty important decisions about its headquarters, the chief executive and such before the functions are fully transferred.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, is quite right about that. On 11 January the Secretary of State announced his intention to appoint Richard Mackenzie CB as the next District Electoral Areas Commissioner. That appointment will be for 12 months on a full-time basis. He is the current Local Government Boundaries Commissioner and a member of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Northern

He will not formally take up his appointment until 1 June 2007. He shall not report to the Secretary of State until the recommendations of the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner have been given effect, with or without modifications, in legislation, so there is a gap.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000207"></a>For the avoidance of any doubt, the District Electoral Areas Commissioner is classified as an ad hoc advisory body. As such, the appointment process does not fall within the remit of the Office of the Commissioner of Public Appointments. On the previous two occasions when a District Electoral Areas Commissioner has been appointed, the practice has been, once the local government boundary commission process was completed, to appoint the existing Local Government Boundaries Commissioner as the District Electoral Areas Commissioner&#151;in other words, the same person at a point afterwards. That occurred in 1992 and 1984, and we are repeating that practice here.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000208"></a>The current boundary commissioner is widely respected, and possesses experience and familiarity with the subject and the necessary considerations to be addressed by the District Electoral Areas Commissioner. That is important now, as it is the wish of Ministers that the District Electoral Areas Commissioner&#146;s recommendations should be brought forward speedily, and that the district electoral areas should be in place for subsequent local elections.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000209"></a>There is no conflict of interest with the two roles being filled by the same person. The appointments are entirely separate. Mr Mackenzie will not be appointed as the District Electoral Areas Commissioner until after he has completed his duties as the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000210"></a>A fair point has been made with regard to wards. The Secretary of State wrote to the leaders of the Northern Ireland parties and the Electoral Commission in October to invite their views on whether or not the existing range of five to seven wards per district electoral area in Northern Ireland should be retained, or changed using this Order in Council. Only one response, in support of retaining the current structure, was received. In the light of that, and of nil responses to a Northern Ireland Office press release on the issue, we decided that the current five-to-seven ward structure should be retained. Parties were given the opportunity to comment on whether they wanted a four to eight structure, but no party chose to oppose the retention of the current five to seven structure.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000211"></a>In a way, we are in the hands of the professional whom Parliament has appointed to do the job. I understand that this is a big change for local government in Northern Ireland&#151;I am not knocking that. It will change the role of councillors in many ways. I pay tribute to the 582 local councillors who, in the past few decades of the Troubles, have been the only elected representatives in Northern Ireland, save for the Assembly. They have carried a massive burden, far greater than their actual powers as councillors justified. In effect, they have the powers that parish councillors have in England but they carried a burden of representative democracy in all those dark years.

<p><a name="070124101000213"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="070124101000386"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections) (Amendment) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000214"></a>The noble Lord said: Before I start, I want to answer one of the questions I did not answer in the previous debate, because it all goes into <I>Hansard</I>. It relates to the expenses of the Registrar-General for marriages. The change has been made on the basis of advice from the current Registrar-General. I do not know why the title has changed, but I will find out and write to Members of the Committee about it. I should have put that answer on the record earlier, and I apologise for missing it out.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000215"></a>This is quite a technical order, and there is a good reason for it. Its purpose is simply to remove any uncertainty over the definition of election expenses which will apply for the purpose of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections on 7 March.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000216"></a>Assembly elections in Northern Ireland are conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Representation of the People Acts 1983 and 1985 and the Elections (Northern Ireland) Act 1985, which are applied to Assembly elections with both specific and general modifications by the Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections) Order 2001.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000217"></a>Section 27 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, which was commenced on 11 September 2006, repeals Sections 90A and 90B of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which define the meaning of election expenses. Both sections were applied to Assembly elections by the 2001 order. It replaces these with new Section 90ZA and Schedule 4A, which define a new meaning of election expenses. However, because these are both new provisions, it is unclear if they are automatically applied to Assembly elections by virtue of the 2001 order.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000218"></a>While the practical differences between the definition in old Sections 90A and 90B and the definition in new Section 90ZA and the schedule are minor&#151;the differences are largely of form rather than substance&#151;we do not wish there to be any room for doubt about which definition will apply for the purposes of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in March. In light of this, we wish to put the matter beyond doubt through an amending instrument which will make it clear that the new definition in  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC409"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC409</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Section 90ZA and Schedule 4A, as inserted by the Electoral Administration Act 2006, applies. That is what the order does.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000219"></a>The order is not controversial: our intention was to make this amendment as part of a wide-ranging order amending the 2001 order to take account of all relevant provisions in the 2006 Act later in the year. However, as the Committee will be aware, the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, which was passed last November, has made provision for an Assembly election to take place in March. This has compelled us to deal with the matter of election expenses now in a separate order, so that candidates for the March election are in no confusion about the basis on which their expenses will be handled. We have consulted the Electoral Commission on the draft order and it is content.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000220"></a>Many people thought that we did not need to do this because it is fairly obvious how the election expenses will be calculated, but we did not want there to be any doubt. This is something that we would have done later in the year to tidy up the legislation from 2006. However, we did not know at the time that the St. Andrews agreement would bring about the potential for elections on 7 March. This order will put any uncertainty completely beyond doubt. Therefore I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000221"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections) (Amendment) Order 2007.&#151;(<I>Lord Rooker.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="070124101000222"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="070124101000387"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> The order may not be controversial, as the Minister said, but the Government have constantly moved elections around in Northern Ireland. A bad precedent was set in 2003 when the process of electoral interference by the Government began and it is to be sincerely hoped that this is the end of it.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000223"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="070124101000388"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I have two brief points. First, we understand why the order has been introduced. It has been brought forward to be in place before the proposed Assembly election in March this year. If the Assembly election does not take place in March, will these new election expenses apply at a later date at a subsequent Assembly election?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000224"></a>Secondly, I put this down as a marker. I still believe that there is confusion, certainly a grey area, about election expenses in a proportional representation election to the Northern Ireland Assembly. For example, a party could select three candidates to contest the election in the constituency and divide that constituency into four areas. The political party could say, &#147;You will go into area A, the second candidate will go into area B, the third candidate will go into area C and all three of you will share the fourth area D&#148;. There would still be confusion about how the election expenses would be divided. I am not asking for an answer to that, but I am placing it on the record.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000225"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="070124101000389"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I will not attempt to answer that because I have not taken part in a proportional representation election. However, political parties are   


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC410"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>voluntary organisations. The legal framework is set by Parliament. How they then conduct themselves within that legal framework is entirely up to the parties. They may decide to carve up constituencies or not. I accept that questions can be asked about the apportionment of expenses, particularly if not all the candidates win and there is some bad feeling, but that would be a problem of success&#151;because the election would have taken place and the success was in getting the election to take place.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000226"></a>The definition of expense provisions in this order will be on the statute book for any future elections. We were going to bring this order forward with a group of other amendments later this year, tidying up loose ends subsequent to the 2006 legislation. We are introducing it now because the St. Andrews agreement proposed the date of 7 March.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000227"></a>I will answer a question that the noble Lord did not ask but I thought he was going to when he stood up. Obviously, we want the election to take place. People are preparing for it. Massive numbers have registered for it&#151;more than 1.1 million. Some 40,000 extra people have registered in the last month, which is really good news. People really intend to cast their votes and make a difference. We want the elections to take place and the political parties will be gearing up for them to take place&#151;as I have noticed even in this House.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000228"></a>Obviously the political parties have asked whether they will be compensated for the expenditure they have incurred if for any reason the elections do not take place. This matter has been raised with the Government and we are currently considering our response. Beyond that I cannot go.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000229"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="070124101000390"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> Before the Minister sits down, did he refer to 1.1 million people registering?</p>

<p><a name="070124101000230"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="070124101000391"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I do not have the figures in front of me. I think it is 1.15 million. I am informed that 1,115,965 people have registered. We are very pleased with that figure. It represents the highest ever return of registration forms. I realise that there were some doubts about this and I saw for myself the posters in Belfast in early January encouraging people to register. Some 40,849 voters will be added to the register in time to allow them to vote in the Assembly elections as a result of the rolling register. It is excellent news for democracy that so many people have registered.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC411"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC411</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000233"></a>The noble Lord said: Before I begin in earnest, I should draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a slight but important error in the Explanatory Memorandum at paragraph 7.6. The last sentence should read,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070124101000310"></a>&#147;The minimum duration of a sexual offences prevention order is five years&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070124101000307"></a>rather than the &#147;maximum&#148; duration, which is a bit of a difference. However, this does not affect in any way what the instrument seeks to achieve.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000234"></a>The Home Office drew this error to the attention the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Select Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments, both of which were content for this to be corrected but asked that a revised version should appear on the OPSI website&#151;which it does&#151;and that the change be reflected in the final published version of the Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000235"></a>The instrument seeks to amend the lists of offences in Schedules 3 and 5 to the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which relate to the notification requirements, commonly referred to as the &#147;sex offenders&#146; register&#148;. In brief, any offender convicted, cautioned or made subject to a finding for an offence listed in Schedule 3 automatically becomes subject to the notification requirements&#151;that is, they go on to the register&#151;subject, in certain cases, to a sentencing or age threshold being met. There is no role for the courts in this process and it is not dependent upon an order from a judge.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000236"></a>A person who has been convicted for an offence listed in Schedule 3 can also be made subject to a foreign travel order where the conditions are met. A conviction, caution or finding for a Schedule 5 offence does not result in automatic sex offender registration because, unlike the offences listed in Schedule 3, the offences in Schedule 5 are not inherently sexual although they could possibly have a sexual motive or connotation. However, where someone is convicted of a Schedule 5 or a Schedule 3 offence, there is discretion for a presiding judge&#151;or a magistrate at a later point&#151;to decide whether the offender poses a risk of serious sexual harm and so make a sexual offences prevention order. The effect of a sexual offences prevention order is to place prohibitions on the offender&#146;s behaviour as well as ensuring that they go on the register.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000237"></a>The instrument seeks to move three offences from the list of offences in Schedule 5, where discretion is afforded to the courts in relation to making an individual subject to the notification requirements, to Schedule 3, where the notification requirements operate independently of any court ruling. The instrument also seeks to add further offences to Schedule 5.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000238"></a>Home Office officials have undertaken a review of the list of offences in Schedules 3 and 5 to ensure that the right offences are included and that they are placed in the right schedule. As part of the review, the Home Office took the opportunity to consult more than 130 organisations, including law enforcement agencies and judicial bodies. The offences to be added by the instrument are those which were specifically recommended by consultees.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC412"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC412</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000239"></a>During the passage of the Police and Criminal Justice Act 2006&#151;of which the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, in particular, will be aware&#151;amendments were tabled to include the offences under Sections 48 to 50 of the 2003 Act in Schedule 3. The offences related to the abuse of children through prostitution and pornography. Currently those offences are listed within Schedule 5.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000240"></a>The reason we resisted the amendments at the time was because the Home Office was carrying out a broader review of the schedules. Originally, the decision to place the three offences on Schedule 5 was taken because we believed that those offences, while undoubtedly unpleasant and despicable, were not strictly sexual offences&#151;unlike, say, rape&#151;but rather they could be motivated by a number of factors such as simple greed. However, I recognise that while it may be true that these offences need not necessarily be strictly sexual in their nature, their perpetrators demonstrate, at the very least, a callous disregard for the sexual well-being of children. They pose a threat and so will require the monitoring that being made subject to the register will bring.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000241"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords on the Benches opposite for raising this important issue in the past and for generating debate more generally in the House. I am pleased to say that the instrument proposes that those three offences are moved from Schedule 5 to Schedule 3 to the 2003 Act.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000242"></a>As I have mentioned already, we have had a long consultation with key partners and, as a result, a number of offences are being added to Schedule 5. First, we are adding two offences of child abduction. This is in response to a general concern and also to a particular case in York where an offender was convicted of child abduction. The offence was not listed in Schedule 3, so the offender did not become subject to the notification requirements as a result of his conviction. As the offence was not listed in Schedule 5 either, the judge did not have any power to consider making a sexual offences prevention order, which would have had the effect, among other things, of making the offender subject to the notification requirements for the duration of that order.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000243"></a>We do not feel that it would be appropriate to add the offences of child abduction to Schedule 3. Although they are serious offences, as many cases arise in the context of custodial disputes, those offenders&#151;usually a parent or guardian&#151;may not warrant automatic registration. However, by adding the offences of child abduction to Schedule 5, we are ensuring that judges have sufficient powers to make offenders subject to the register in cases where they deem that the child abduction had a sexual motive.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000244"></a>We have also sought to include a group of offences in Schedule 5 which may be indicative of stalking behaviour and may increase the risk of sexual harm. The offences are harassment, sending indecent articles by post and sending indecent messages. Theft and burglary with intent to steal are also being added to cover stalking behaviour where, for example, a person with a sexual motive steals a woman&#146;s underwear from the washing line or breaks into a home to commit a similar act. The offences of  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC413"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC413</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>burglary with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm or to do unlawful damage are already listed in Schedule 5. We are also adding the common law offence of outraging public decency to Schedule 5.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000245"></a>The list of offences in Schedule 5 was originally drafted to be consistent with the list of violent offences in Schedule 15 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. However, we have since formed the view that it is not necessary for these schedules to mirror each other in their entirety as they serve two distinct purposes. That is why we are making the changes to Schedule 5 with the aim of better protecting the public from sexual harm.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000246"></a>I should stress that a conviction or caution for a Schedule 5 offence will not automatically make someone subject to the sex offender register. Taking an example already mentioned, in a case of child abduction where the child was taken in the context of a custody dispute, it is unlikely to be appropriate for the offender to be made subject to a sexual offences prevention order, and consequently the register, unless the court was satisfied, among other things&#151;as it might be if there was in fact a sexual motive&#151;that such an order was necessary for the purposes of protecting the public or any particular members of the public from serious sexual harm from the offender.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000247"></a>The courts already have powers to make offenders subject to sexual offences prevention orders and, as a result, the notification requirements, for a wide range of offences already listed in Schedule 5. By adding the offences mentioned, we are seeking to ensure that all appropriate offences are covered. Attempts and conspiracy to commit offences in Schedules 3 and 5 are equally covered.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000248"></a>Similar offences are being added to Schedules 3 and 5 in respect of Northern Ireland, although Northern Ireland is also adding the offence of riotous, disorderly and indecent behaviour under Section 9 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968. This is being added because the Police Service of Northern Ireland occasionally uses this provision to prosecute individuals for exposure in addition to the exposure offence under Section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. We are not adding an equivalent offence for England and Wales and there have been no requests that we do so.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000249"></a>This instrument does not have effect in Scotland. Scotland has a slightly different system from that in England and Wales which fits better with its common law traditions and the approach taken by the Scottish courts. Scotland has no intention to amend its equivalent schedules at the current time.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000250"></a>With the experience of how the Sexual Offences Act 2003 has worked in practice, and having taking on board comments from those involved in its operation, we are keen to ensure that the courts and police have the right and appropriate powers to deal with sex offenders. The draft order aims to do just that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000253"></a>My noble friend Lady Anelay tabled amendments at the Committee and Report stages of the Police and Justice Bill last year to achieve the objective provided by this order. It goes wider than the provisions of my noble friend&#146;s amendment, but does so in a way that we can support.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000254"></a>My noble friend has asked me to put on record her thanks to the staff in the office of the Minister,  Mr Vernon Coaker, for their courtesy in writing to her before Christmas to alert her to the fact that the order would be tabled on 18 December.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000255"></a>Sections 48 to 50 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which make provision for the offences of recruiting or controlling a child involved in pornography or prostitution, are not prescribed for the purposes of notification requirements under Part 2 of that Act. These sections are not being used by the police and prosecutors because they do not have the notification that applies to most of, if not all, the other provisions relating to the abuse of children. There is no valid reason why people convicted of such an offence should not be required to notify the police of their details because they are directly involved in the abuse and exploitation of children and need monitoring and risk assessment.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000256"></a>My noble friend explained in Committee on 11 July 2006&#151;at col. 619 of the <I>Official Report</I>&#151;that when the Sexual Offences Act 2003 passed through both Houses we, on this side, had missed that point. Without a departmental team behind us, it is perhaps not too surprising that we did not pick up on this omission. However, as soon as the problem came to light, we resolved to persuade the Government to rectify it. The prime mover of these matters was my honourable friend Sir Paul Beresford, and I pay tribute to his untiring work on these and other related matters.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000257"></a>When we debated these matters last year, the Government persuaded us that we should not press the question to a vote as they were carrying out a review on how the Act was operating, as the Minister has explained in some detail. As a consequence of that review, the Government are bringing this order before the Committee today.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000258"></a>We accept that the order will help to fulfil the policy objectives of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in that it will assist in public protection, the prevention and detection of sexual offences and the monitoring and management of risk posed by sex offenders. Even if there is no wide usage of these powers, it is right that they should be added to the statute book. We are aware of public concern regarding the risk posed by sex offenders, and that risk should be reduced and managed as thoroughly as possible. We support the making of the order.</p>

<h5><a name="070124101000324"></a>6.31 pm</h5>

<p><a name="070124101000262"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070124101000396"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</b> rose to move, That  the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000263"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am glad to introduce this order, which provides for a complete overhaul of the legislation regulating pharmacists and extends statutory regulation to pharmacy technicians for the first time. This is an order about patient safety and public protection. It fits within the Government&#146;s programme to modernise the way that health professions are regulated. In a number of important respects, it follows the model used for dentists, nurses, opticians and other health professionals. Our work is making regulation more responsive to patients&#146; needs and better at protecting them.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000264"></a>The order will improve the way in which the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain protects patients by: making clearer the society&#146;s responsibilities in protecting the public and its accountability in doing so; reforming the society&#146;s registration process, bringing pharmacy technicians in England and Wales into statutory regulation for the first time; updating provisions for education and training, and introducing statutory requirements for continuing professional development; supporting an emphasis on fitness-to-practise issues; reforming the society&#146;s statutory committee structure; and making the necessary transitional arrangements from the current system.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000265"></a>Pharmacists play a vital part in the provision of healthcare services. They have long been involved in supplying medicines and advising people on their use. However, the practice of pharmacy is entering a new era&#151;one where direct clinical care of patients will become core business. For example, no longer is the prescribing of medicines just the domain of doctors, dentists and nurses. Since 2003, there have been   


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC416"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pharmacists who have acted as supplementary prescribers as part of agreed clinical management plans, and some pharmacists are now completing additional training to become independent prescribers of a full range of medicines. That will become commonplace. For the first time, the new community pharmacy arrangements across Great Britain all contain clinical services.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000266"></a>The demand for clinical services from pharmacists continues to grow. In England, we will be introducing pharmacists with a special interest who, when suitably accredited, will specialise in a particular clinical area, just like GPs with a special interest. Pharmacists will also continue to play a huge part in educating, advising and supporting other healthcare professionals, including doctors and non-medical prescribers, on the prescription, supply and administration of medicines. Pharmacy technicians are also starting to provide more direct clinical care of patients. This trend is likely to continue as health reforms progress, with more flexible use of staff properly trained to undertake roles safely to increase access to medicines and care.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000267"></a>There is clearly great scope for pharmacists to do harm if they do not perform properly. That is why pharmacy was the earliest healthcare profession to be statutorily regulated. The latest legislation to do this was the Pharmacy Act 1954. That has served the profession well but is now out of date and limited in its scope compared with that of other health profession regulators. We wish to ensure that those who use the services of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians benefit from the same safeguards as those recently introduced for doctors, nurses, allied health professions, opticians and dentists.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000268"></a>The main provisions to bring pharmacist regulation in line with other professions are the requirement to undergo continuing professional development so that registrants keep their knowledge, skills and aptitudes up to date as long as they continue practising, and a wider range of powers and sanctions relating to investigating and dealing with allegations of impaired fitness to practise. These include impairment through ill health as well as performance and conduct, and impairment related to criminal convictions. New sanctions include the ability to suspend registrants when necessary to protect the public while their fitness to practise is being investigated and adjudicated, and the ability to restrict the practice of those unfit practitioners to areas in which they are safe to practise by attaching conditions to their registration; new powers enabling the society to disclose fitness-to-practise information where that is in the public interest, and to require others to disclose information to it about fitness-to-practise matters; a new duty to co-operate with other public authorities and bodies with an interest in pharmacy matters; and new powers to require practising registrants to be covered by an adequate and appropriate indemnity arrangement, although the implementation of this provision will be delayed while we consider further, in conjunction with the other regulatory bodies, the implications of a court judgment about indemnity arrangements that was handed down over the summer.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC417"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC417</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000269"></a>This order also contains some provisions specific to the world of pharmacy. The Government want to take this opportunity to extend statutory regulation to pharmacy technicians, in recognition of how their role has developed. They now play a major part in dispensing medicines and other areas of pharmacy practice which used to be the preserve of pharmacists. For example, in some hospitals pharmacy technicians will take a medication history of newly admitted patients. It is entirely right that those who use the service they provide should be protected by safeguards appropriate to their level of skill, knowledge and responsibility.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000270"></a>The provisions relating to the regulation of pharmacy technicians relate only to England and Wales. This is because of the separate powers of the Scottish Parliament to enact its own legislation in respect of devolved healthcare professions, which are those which were not subject to statutory regulation at the time of the Scotland Act 1998. However, we have agreed in principle with the Minister for Health in Scotland that we will introduce an amending order later this year, which will need to be approved by both the United Kingdom and the Scottish Parliaments, which will extend the scope of this current order to encompass Scottish pharmacy technicians. In order to make sure that the regulation of this profession happens consistently across Great Britain, we do not propose to commence the provisions of this order which relate to the regulation of pharmacy technicians until the amendments to its scope are in place.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000271"></a>Another provision peculiar to these professions is the introduction of a division of the regulator&#146;s registers to distinguish between the vast majority of registrants who are in practice and the very few who do not actively practise, such as those who have retired or are on a career break, or who, although they have qualified as pharmacists, are working in fields where they do not practise as a pharmacist or pharmacy technician. For these people it will not be practical or relevant to keep up with continuing professional development or to be covered by indemnity insurance arrangements. I am satisfied that the definition contained in the order of what is meant by &#147;practising&#148; is broad enough to ensure that anyone whose work may have either a direct or an indirect impact on those using pharmacy services will be required to meet the requirements for practising registrants. This includes those working in academic research, management, journalism and industry who give advice on pharmacy matters and hold themselves out to be pharmacists or pharmacy technicians. The order contains provisions in the form of offences and the provision of guidance which will support this.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000272"></a>Members will appreciate that a piece of legislation of this size and scope has been in production for some time. It has been suggested that issues like the consideration of this order to amend the Pharmacy Act would be better held back until after the release of the findings of the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s review of medical regulation and the parallel review of non-medical regulation in the light of the fifth report of the Shipman inquiry. However, the contents of this order are essentially an overhaul of the regulation of  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC418"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC418</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pharmacists and the administration of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, which are long overdue. The extension of statutory regulation of pharmacy technicians is also in the public interest. The subjects covered by this order are issues that need addressing, irrespective of the findings of these two reviews, and they in no way pre-empt either their recommendations or the Government&#146;s response to them.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000273"></a>This order has been well researched, and has found broad favour and support from those who are most affected by it. It has been subject to a full publication and public consultation as required by the Health Act 1999, under which the order is made. A copy of the report on the consultation is available on the Department of Health website. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000274"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians Order 2007. <I>5th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="070124101000275"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070124101000397"></a>Lord McColl of Dulwich:</b> The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for introducing this order so succinctly and clearly. It is an order which we broadly welcome. As she said, it serves to bring up to date the rules governing the regulation of pharmacists in Great Britain and, for the first time, to put in place arrangements to regulate pharmacy technicians in England and Wales under the supervision of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000276"></a>The order has been the subject of extensive consultation within the pharmacy profession and outside it. As regards the principal provisions in it, we are satisfied that it reflects the society&#146;s policy&#151;which we very definitely share&#151;to strengthen and clarify its powers to protect and promote the health and safety of the general public. In so doing, the order completely replaces the Pharmacy Act 1954.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000277"></a>I am pleased that there has been no question of diluting the role or function of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society as the body responsible for regulating the profession. We have said many times how strongly we support the concept of professional self-regulation, and in the case of pharmacists we see self-regulation, as set out here, encompassing the complete spectrum of regulatory activity, from registration to the setting of standards, and from education, training and continuing professional development to disciplinary procedures. The order is entirely consistent with the provisions contained within the society&#146;s Royal Charter, and builds usefully upon them.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000278"></a>As the Minister well knows, much thought has recently been devoted, under the Donaldson and Foster reviews, to the whole area of professional regulation in medicine and allied professions. We do not yet know the outcome of those reviews. However, I should be grateful if the Minister could reassure me that, whatever the outcome in relation to other professional disciplines, she does not envisage substantial changes being necessary to the content of this order. Nothing, of course, can remain set in stone for ever, but I hope that after the very thorough work  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC419"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC419</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>done by the society, its members and, indeed, the department, there will be no question of having to go back again to square one.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0006.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000279"></a>Perhaps the most obvious way in which the new rules represent an improvement over the old ones is in respect of fitness-to-practise procedures. As we have seen with doctors, dentists and other professions, it is right for the relevant regulatory body to have at its disposal a menu of options&#151;in this instance, not only the power to strike a pharmacist off the register but also powers to suspend a pharmacist or to place conditions on his registration, as the Minister has indicated. Without such powers the public could be at risk, so we welcome these new provisions.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000280"></a>However, in its response to the consultation, the society raised one concern which I notice was not accepted by the Government. Article 49(3) provides that, where an allegation is referred to a fitness to practise committee, the society must inform departmental Ministers, the local PCT and the person&#146;s employer. The worry here is that if the allegation is false&#151;and perhaps maliciously so&#151;a huge amount of damage could be done to the reputation and standing of the individual and of his employing organisation by the fact of the matter becoming public knowledge before it is resolved. To guard against that contingency, the society suggested that notification in certain well-defined types of case need not be mandatory but could instead be discretionary, subject to clear rules. Why was this proposal not accepted?</p>
<h5><a name="070124101000325"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000281"></a>The second conspicuous area of change in the society&#146;s powers relates to education and training. These changes are, equally, very welcome. Up to now, there has been some uncertainty about the society&#146;s powers in relation to education. The order not only clarifies the position but also provides for the education committee to have a wider role in such areas as revalidation and recertification. This is all part of the general drive to promote professionalism in all its varying aspects and that, surely, has to be the way forward for a profession on which the NHS, patients and the public are increasingly becoming reliant. In that connection, it is welcome to see in Article 12(5) that knowledge and use of English is included as one of the factors which may be considered as part of the overall professional qualification.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000282"></a>Similarly, I was pleased to see in Article 48(2) that a pharmacist&#146;s or technician&#146;s &#147;attitudes and behaviour&#148; are to be regarded as integral to the judgment of professional misconduct. The clear implication is that attitudes and behaviour are important elements of what it means to be professionally qualified, and that is surely right.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000283"></a>I have two further questions. As the Minister made clear, the registration and regulation of pharmacy technicians under the order applies to England and Wales. That is because in Scotland the regulation of professions recognised after 1998 is a devolved matter. We often hear that diversity in healthcare  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC420"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements north and south of the border is one of the glories of devolution. I am pleased that the Minister accepts that there is an issue to be addressed here. With dentists and the professions allied to dentistry, it was possible to achieve what was effectively a UK-wide regulation by means of an agreement between the Westminster and Scottish Parliaments. I am pleased that the Minister and her counterparts in Edinburgh are looking to achieve a similar uniformity of regulation for pharmacy technicians. That is very welcome.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000284"></a>Concern was also expressed by the society that under Article 5(1), the Privy Council has a power to alter the size and composition of the council, subject to specified limitations. The society&#146;s charter provides for the Privy Council to do so only if it receives an application to do so from the society in pursuance of a special general resolution. Can the Minister confirm that the order should not be read as meaning that the Privy Council has a power to vary the council&#146;s composition in the absence of any such request from the society?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000285"></a>The order has been long awaited by the pharmaceutical profession. We wish it well.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000286"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070124101000398"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the order. As we have heard, it will update, strengthen and clarify the society&#146;s powers to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public. We agree with that and we support the order.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000287"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070124101000399"></a>Lord Colwyn:</b> I, too, welcome the order, which will bring pharmacists into line with other healthcare professionals. Pharmacists play an ever-increasing role in the provision of primary care. The order will recognise that fact and improve the system to ensure fitness to practice and statutorily to regulate pharmacy technicians. That will provide more protection for the public who often experience difficulty in obtaining an appointment to see their GP and are turning to their pharmacist for healthcare advice. Other professional groups, including my own of dentistry, have undertaken fitness-to-practise reforms, and it is right that the pharmacists do the same. It is important that all professional groups keep up to date and maintain a programme of continuing professional development.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000288"></a>The order is 73 pages long. Could the Minister remind me whether registered pharmacy technicians will be able to be an alternative to pharmacists in pharmaceutical outlets, including chemist shops and GP surgeries, where it is extremely convenient to be able to collect medicines, especially in rural areas, where there is not always a chemist in the vicinity?</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000289"></a>Finally, when the osteopaths and chiropractic practitioners became registered they were hit with unexpectedly high registration fees and extra costs for indemnity. Has the Minister any idea&#151;and the information may be well hidden in the 73 pages&#151;what the cost of registration and indemnity might be for a pharmacist and pharmacy technician under these new regulations? I also stress the importance of the points made by my noble friend Lord McColl on  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC421"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC421</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>attitudes, behaviour and language. I am sure that the Minister will have time to respond to those concerns at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000290"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070124101000400"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I am very grateful for the broad and strong support from noble Lords opposite on this order, which is technical but extremely important.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000291"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McColl, asked whether changes would be made following the two reviews that are currently taking place. We must wait for the White Paper, which will be published a little later this year. We do not want to pre-empt any decisions relating to that. Some changes may be made to strengthen best regulatory practice across all regulators, but pharmacists would certainly not be singled out, as it were.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000292"></a>In relation to disclosure of information when an investigation is taking place, I well understand the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord McColl. It is important for patient protection that those who employ or contract with pharmacists or pharmacy technicians are alerted as soon as possible when the society is investigating an allegation. In rare cases, this will be the first warning received of a serious problem that would put patients at risk if a pharmacist or pharmacy technician continued to work. Before referring complaints to the statutory committees, the registrar of the society weeds out cases in which statutory action would not be appropriate. So there would be time. It would not be a knee-jerk reaction; a procedure would be followed before people on the outside were alerted to the complaints.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000293"></a>I appreciate that pharmacists or pharmacy technicians and those who represent them may find the requirement for disclosure that an allegation has been made unsettling. However, this is a tried and tested approach used by other regulators and we consider that it represents an appropriate balance between a registrant&#146;s privacy and the need to protect members of the public, which of course is the purpose of professional regulation.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000294"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070124101000401"></a>Lord McColl of Dulwich:</b> I thank the Minister very much for allowing me to intervene. Do I take it that someone would be suspended only over something relevant to the safety of the patient, not for some other misconduct? Would it be related only to whether the technician was a danger to his patient?</p>

<p><a name="070124101000295"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070124101000402"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I will write to the noble Lord with clarification, but in any case when a complaint was so serious that it was being  


<notus-date day="24" month="1" year="2007" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC422"></a><b>24 Jan 2007 : Column GC422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>investigated by a committee there would be some potential danger to the public involved. Therefore, I imagine that for wider interested persons to be informed there would be some danger to the public, but I shall clarify that point in writing to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000296"></a>I shall respond to the other questions. With regard to the costs of registration and indemnity, there are no hidden figures in these pages. However, increases in registration charges can be made only after consultation with the registrant, so I would not have thought there would be any great hikes in charges. I am sure the registrants themselves would oppose such a measure. We are taking time to explore the whole issue of indemnity insurance, but many pharmacists already pay for indemnity costs, so I imagine there would be no huge change there.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000297"></a>On the use of English, we are glad to see that it is important in relation to attitudes and behaviours in misconduct cases. It is good and proper that the use of English is considered in all those cases. With regard to the change in the size and composition of the council, it should not be read as the Privy Council. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, asked if the Privy Council could vary the composition of the society of the council without a request. I understand that, yes, that would be possible, but there are no plans to do so. It is simply potentially possible.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000298"></a>I do not know if I have left any questions unanswered. Members may wish to remind me now; if not, I will gladly respond in writing.</p>

<p><a name="070124101000299"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070124101000403"></a>Lord Colwyn:</b> May I remind the Minister of the question of whether a pharmacy technician and a pharmacist have equal standing in the running of a chemist shop?</p>

<p><a name="070124101000300"></a><b><a name="70124-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070124101000404"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I beg the noble Lord&#146;s pardon. Pharmacy technicians can work in community pharmacies. We think that would be of benefit, especially to rural communities, as the noble Lord indicated, but they would have to be under the supervision of a registered pharmacist.</p>

<a name="70124-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070124101000301"></a>Having answered those questions, I am delighted that we are all in broad agreement on this order, and I commend it to your Lordships.</p>

<a name="07012492000006"></a><b><a name="70124-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07012492000018"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has today made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07012492000007"></a>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has today published its five-year strategy for reducing error in the benefits system.</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07012492000008"></a>DWP has made great progress in reducing fraud in the benefits system which is now at its lowest-ever level. However, more work is needed to reduce both official and customer error. The department is committed to providing a quality service to its customers by paying the right amount of benefit to all its customers every time. But sometimes staff fail to follow procedures and sometimes customers make mistakes in the information they provide to the department. This results in both official and customer error. This strategy for reducing error in the benefits system focuses on:</p>
preventing error from entering the system from the outset;correcting error that is already within the benefits system; andincreasing compliance with and understanding of processes by both staff and customers to ensure that once claims are corrected, they remain correct.
<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07012492000009"></a>As part of this strategy, DWP will also launch today a new customer awareness campaign pilot, Something to Declare?, in Peterborough. The aim of this campaign is to help our customers to understand more fully the changes they need to report as they happen to help us keep their benefit claims correct and up to date. Copies of the strategy have been placed in the Library and are also available to Members from the Vote Office. The report will also be available online at www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2007/error_strategy.asp.</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_head1"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="07012492000004"></a>Tax Credits</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="07012492000012"></a><b><a name="70124-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07012492000020"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)  has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07012492000013"></a>The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) made a ruling in Strasbourg on 14 November on the case of Tsfayo v The United Kingdom (application number 60860/00).</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07012492000014"></a>Ms Tsfayo&#146;s case concerned a dispute regarding her entitlement to housing benefit and whether she was afforded a fair hearing of her appeal by an independent and impartial tribunal as set out in Article 6(1) of the ECHR. The ECtHR held that the lack of an independent and impartial first instance tribunal could not, in that particular case, be remedied by judicial review.</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07012492000015"></a>In contrast, tax credits provide for a right of appeal against a decision on entitlement, and therefore an opportunity to challenge the amount  of any overpayment that has arisen, or the determination of a penalty or a decision that interest should be charged on an overpayment of tax credit. These appeals are to the Unified Appeals Tribunals, which are independent and impartial to HMRC and therefore the provisions of Article 6(1) of the ECHR are satisfied.</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07012492000016"></a>Unlike a decision regarding entitlement to tax credits, HMRC's decision to recover an overpayment under Section 28 of the Tax Credits Act is not a determination of civil rights and obligations within Article 6(1) of the ECHR. Even if it were, however, in seeking to recover an overpayment, HMRC is exercising a discretionary power and an appeal against such a decision by way of judicial review would fully satisfy Article 6(1) of the ECHR.</p>

<a name="70124-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07012492000017"></a>A claimant does have the right to dispute the recovery of an overpayment by way of an internal review by the Tax Credit Office. In addition, they  can ask either the adjudicator or, through  their Member of Parliament, the Parliamentary Ombudsman to consider the handling of their case. The ECtHR ruling has no adverse implications for tax credits.</p>

In response to this situation, Parliament passed a Bill in November 2004 to reintroduce 45 additional reserved parliamentary seats for women.</p>

<a name="70124w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="07012485000026"></a>These reserved seats do not represent geographical constituencies; rather, new women MPs are selected by the elected MPs, with a proportionate distribution of the new seats among the parties represented in the House. This law is valid for 10 years. The introduction of the Bill was contested by several women's groups who campaigned for these seats to be directly elected and for the number of reserved seats to be increased. There are no reserved seats specifically for women from ethnic minorities.</p>

To support financial inclusion we want people to have their housing payments paid into a bank account and to set up a direct debit or standing order to pay the rent to their landlord. This has the advantage of being a safe and secure method of payment and provides certainty for landlords that rent will be paid.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="07012485000030"></a>The Post Office card account was designed to be a very simple account with very limited functions.

This ruling was in response to a submission by Sergeant Selman's counsel that the Royal Military Police had reasonable grounds by the time his statement was taken to suspect his involvement in an offence. That being so, he should have been treated as a suspect rather than a witness, and cautioned and interviewed under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The transcript of Sergeant Selman's interviews under caution was not excluded but the Judge Advocate ordered that those parts of the interview which related to the witness statement should be removed. Following this ruling the prosecution decided not to use the interviews of Sergeant Selman in evidence.</p>
