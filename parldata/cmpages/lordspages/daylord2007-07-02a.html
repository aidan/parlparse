She has been in this House long enough to have built up a very substantial reputation, not just for hard work and thoroughness but for the very great decency with which she treats all Members of this House. She has set herself as one of her over-riding ambitions to work in the interests of the whole House. On behalf of the Opposition we very much welcome that view.</p>

<a name="70702-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0707025000043"></a>I take this small opportunity to pay tribute to her predecessor, the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, who earned her place in history as the first black woman to be Leader of the House of Lords and in the Cabinet. She was a very remarkable feature of this House, particularly as Secretary of State for International Development. She goes on to different things, perhaps not better&#151;perhaps they will be&#151;but certainly different. We wish her well for the future as she works with the European Union.</p>

<a name="70702-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0707025000044"></a>I cannot resist remarking on the absence from the Front Bench of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton&#151;the last Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords. I very much hope that we shall see his like again some time in the future, but for now it is a loss to this House, both in body and spirit. We wish him well. However, the purpose of my speech is to welcome the noble Baroness as Leader of the House and Lord President of the Council. We all look forward to working with her.</p>

I also pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Amos. I sincerely hope that she gets the job in Europe for which she is applying as it would be a very happy coalition of her passions and experience, and Europe would do well to make use of them.</p>

<a name="70702-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0707025000046"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, knows that if she wants advice, she only has to come to the Liberal Democrats; indeed, these days I do a quick count every time I come in. As the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said, she has a very seductive manner. Indeed, in my daydreams I sometimes think that&#151;</p>

My other problem is thinking of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, as the young Octavius, but that is another matter. As he hinted, if there is such a thing as a good House of Commons man, she is certainly a good House of Lords woman. We shall all be well protected by her skills in the weeks, months and years ahead.

We are very conscious that she has always acted in the interests of the House, and that is particularly important for the Cross-Benchers. On a personal note, I have greatly enjoyed working with her, and we have never had a cross word. From her past work in international development and from the smile on her face in the past week, I know that she is very happy in her new job. It will be good for her, and I am sure that it will be good for Africa, and we wish her well. We shall also miss greatly the presence of a Lord Chancellor in this House, particularly because it is the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, who is leaving us after his very distinguished career here. We wish him well outside the House.</p>

She cannot be with us today as she is on government business, but she will be delighted by the tributes that have been paid to her, and I share them. It is a sadness that we no longer have my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton with us, although I am sure that he will be with us on the Back Benches entertaining us and helping us in our debates for a long time to come.

I stand here also as part of a Labour group with whom I share the same values and beliefs, and I look forward to working closely with all of them in the future. More than anything, the honour that was bestowed on me was this: my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said, &#147;I want you to lead the House of Lords&#148;.

As indicated in the recent energy White Paper, we intend the UK&#146;s first CCS demonstration plant to be up and running some time between 2011 and 2014. Current indications are that we will be among the first, if not the first, in the world to do so.</p>

Is it not regrettable that the BP plant for carbon capture at Peterhead in Scotland has been scrapped because of the delay in the formulation of government policy when it was one of the most advanced of its kind in the world? Are there not half a dozen other projects at various stages of development? Why cannot the Government adopt an incentive scheme similar to that provided for renewables to get these projects going and thus generate substantial commercial prospects, both in Britain and abroad?</p>

The Government have opted for a competition because accepting the BP project would have obliged us to put all our eggs in one basket. It is important to get the technology right, given its significance for future progress, not just in the United Kingdom but the world.</p>

Is the Minister aware that last week I received a letter from his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker? Because this project is no longer viable, it cannot be put on permanent hold due to the geology of the Miller field. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, told me that the project was not even being considered as a possible opt-in for the European emissions trading system and would never be able to benefit from the carbon credits available under that system. Is that not a hugely damaging missed opportunity by the Government?</p>

One was to support the BP project as it stood and accept that as a decision indicating the Government&#146;s very significant support. The support that the Government will give to the winner of any competition will be measured in hundreds of millions of pounds and will be a very important development. The Government had a

That is against a background of China in particular, and India, having enormous numbers of coal-burning power stations. That is why this technological breakthrough is so important but, as the noble Lord indicated, other issues are at stake. We are discussing this technology in relation to one very important dimension of the problem.</p>

Does my noble friend agree that we are one of the world leaders in energy? As a former director of Drax power station, one of the largest coal-fired stations, I can say that we are now completely up to date with many things.

He is right in saying that we should recognise that, even with the timetable for this competition, Britain will be in the lead in developing this technology when it comes on stream between 2011 and 2014. I recognise that my noble friend emphasises the need for co-operation between departments and across technologies and across nations in order to deal with this massive problem of climate change.</p>

I congratulate the noble Lord on taking up the Liberal Democrat policy on the DTI, but will implementing that policy cause any hold-up in the bid for carbon storage and capture?</p>

Under the then netting-off funding arrangements, safety camera partnerships reclaimed &#163;99,542,900 in expenditure, which was directly attributed to the prevention, detection and enforcement of offences.

Cameras are not cash-driven. The impact of cameras is clear. The national safety camera programme evaluation report, based on four years&#146; experience and published in December 2005, found a 42 per cent reduction in people killed or seriously injured at camera sites across the 38 partnership areas. That means about 1,745 fewer people killed or seriously injured per annum, including 100 fewer deaths. The value of the cameras is self-evident from those data.</p>

This results not only in a diminution of the discretion available in the prosecution of speeding offences, but in the fact that rank bad drivers, who daily do things like tailgating, dangerous overtaking and driving while holding a mobile phone, are not dealt with. Would he pass on to the chief officers of police the anxiety in this country on the matter? As the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne did, I declare an interest in this matter&#151;on the other side of the fence, being a retired magistrate.</p>

We&#151;the Government&#151;are clear that dedicated traffic officers and technology both have a vital part to play in reducing excessive speeds. There can be no doubt&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, gave full voice to this&#151;that speed cameras are effective. They operate as a continuous deterrent, freeing up police time for other duties, including, in particular, dealing with the precise problems that the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, referred to. I share the noble Viscount&#146;s concerns about tailgating and so on. However, more people are being monitored for speeding. The approach is very effective and is clearly reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads, particularly among the most vulnerable&#151;young people.</p>

I was told today that the department does not have the slightest idea when they will be completed. When does the noble Lord expect the work to be done, and when will the building be made as safe as possible, especially in the light of recent events?</p>

As I said in my Answer, there are other priorities for maintenance of the building. The cast-iron roofs and the modernisation of the palace&#146;s mechanical and electrical services are two of the major things that need to be done to this ancient building. The problem with cleaning the courtyards is, to some extent, that normally that can only be done in recesses because it does not involve just cleaning but repairs to the stonework, windows and the drainage, which is noisy and disruptive. Also, it is not possible to do this work when another project is under way. For example, the refurbishment of the Refreshment Department, which finished last year, meant that the courtyard there had to be used for that rather than be cleaned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0707025000104"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that there has been a most undesirable delay to the opening of the visitor reception building.

Those are to do with fighting terrorism and international crime. As global priorities change, so must those of the Foreign Office.

There is no doubt that, as befitting a Bill which deals with such important subjects, it has been the subject of vigorous debate, both in this House and in the other place. In this House we have had debates which have been informed by the special experience and expertise that noble Lords can bring to bear on this and on many other subjects.</p>

<a name="70702-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0707025000148"></a>There is no doubt in my mind that the Bill has benefited from those debates. The Bill that has been sent back to us by the other place is stronger than it would have been without the contribution of this House in identifying and getting to the heart of the issues which are of the most importance. The other place may not have agreed with this House on all those issues, but it is plain that the debate in your Lordships&#146; House has provided a very important context for the other place&#146;s consideration. I have no doubt that the Bill is the better for it.</p>

<a name="70702-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0707025000149"></a>As one would expect, the meaning of mental disorder was one of those critical issues identified by your Lordships&#146; House. The simplified definition itself met with considerable support. Debate concentrated instead on what, if anything, should be excluded from that definition. As noble Lords will recall, there are three exclusions from the definition of mental disorder in Section 1 of the Mental Health Act as it stands: &#147;promiscuity or other immoral conduct&#148;, &#147;sexual deviancy&#148; and &#147;dependence on alcohol or drugs&#148;. The Bill, as first introduced, removed the first two and reworded the third.</p>

<a name="70702-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0707025000150"></a>On Report, this House replaced that single exclusion with four new exclusions for: substance misuse; sexual identity or orientation; commission, or likely commission, of illegal or disorderly acts; and cultural, religious or political beliefs. This amendment was reversed by the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="70702-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0707025000151"></a>In introducing his amendment on Report, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="0707025000358"></a>&#147;There needs to be some limit to guard against the inappropriate use of the clinician&#146;s power of detention. Without such limits, the powers are capable of being used, even in a well-intentioned way, as a form of social control&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/2/07; col. 906.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000346"></a>The Government could not agree more. We believe that those limits are to be found in the Act&#151;in the criteria for detention and in the safeguards which are themselves strengthened by the Bill. But I fully accept that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, spoke for all Members of the House when he went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="0707025000359"></a>&#147;The law should make the position clear. It is not enough for a person to be odd, eccentric or a social misfit; the only legal grounds for compulsory detention are an underlying mental health diagnosis&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/2/07; col. 907.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000347"></a>Again, we agree. The law should make the position clear; in our view it does. The Bill does not permit any compulsory intervention except where the relevant criteria are met. Those criteria cannot be met except on the basis of a disability or disorder of the mind.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_813"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 813</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0707025000152"></a>Although not drafted in that way, the amendment which the other place rejected contained two types of exclusions&#151;substantive exclusions for conditions which are recognised mental disorders and others whose effect is declaratory. The proposal to exclude substance misuse was at least in part an example of the former. It has become clear in the course of debate here and in the other place that &#147;substance misuse&#148; was intended, in the words of the honourable Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, Mr Tim Loughton, to ensure that,</p>
<ul><a name="0707025000376"></a>&#147;neither the binge drinker nor the casual consumer of drugs is considered a case for compulsion&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/6/07; col. 1326.]</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000348"></a>But there is no such exclusion now, and no reason to believe that such people are being detained. On the other hand, if we did have an exclusion there is a risk that we might prevent the use of the Act in those rare cases where acute intoxication is so severe that detention is a legitimate clinical response.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70702-0003.htm"/>


<a name="70702-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0707025000153"></a>The noble Earl&#146;s amendment, which the other place rejected, dealt more with things that are simply not recognised mental disorders. Sexual orientation is not a mental disorder; being homosexual or bisexual does not make one mentally disordered, any more than being heterosexual does. Holding religious, political or cultural beliefs does not, of itself, make one mentally disordered; nor does committing a crime. It follows that none of these matters falls within the definition of mental disorder in the Act; indeed, to say so in the Act would be legally otiose.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0707025000154"></a>Strong arguments have been advanced for exclusions. Perhaps I should test the patience of the House by going through them. The first is that, by not changing the Act, we will encourage clinicians to change their practice for the worse. I do not see the logic of that, or any evidence for it; nor is it consistent with the ethical and professional responsibilities of those who will have the responsibility for this under the law. Secondly, it has been argued that the list of exclusions will make psychiatrists reflect more closely on how their own values and experience influence their decisions. That is, of course, a good thing to encourage; it should be central to clinical practice in mental health services. However, the idea that this kind of careful practice will not happen without a few strictly unnecessary words in an Act, or that those words will create a sea change in attitudes, stretches credulity.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0707025000155"></a>The same is true of the third argument&#151;I recognise that this is a very important matter&#151;that those words will reassure particularly those in black and minority ethnic communities, who fear that the Act may be misused to their detriment or to that of their families. I have met representatives of black communities and the black churches several times, and I know just how strongly they feel about this matter. We do not know why there are such markedly higher rates of diagnosis of certain conditions in people from many black and minority ethnic communities, or why they are much more likely to be admitted to hospital or detained under the Act. None of us has seen convincing research. Research to date has been far better at describing than explaining the  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_814"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 814</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>situation. However, although we may not know why it happens, we do know that it does. Nor are we in any doubt that steps can and should be taken to change it. That is why this Government established their Delivering Race Equality programme, announced in December 2005 alongside their response to the inquiry into the death of David &#147;Rocky&#148; Bennett.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0707025000156"></a>A fourth argument made in favour of the exclusions is that they would protect against individual psychiatrists extending the boundaries of mental disorder, encouraged by the fact that the Bill relies more on their subjective opinions. The Bill does nothing of the sort, but, even if it did, exclusions would not help. If some psychiatrists were tempted to act in that way, they would be arguing not for new mental disorders but about whether or not certain things were manifestations of established mental disorders. A fifth argument is that the exclusions are needed as a protection against Governments yet to come. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, was good enough to say on Report that this country is not Soviet Russia and is in no danger of being like it. However, once we get to the point where the rule of law has broken down, the wording of the law is not likely to save us. Another argument simply questioned the harm of the exclusions. It is not disputed that mental disorders can manifest themselves in the form of religious or political views, or in actions that break the criminal law. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said on Report, the key test is whether there is an underlying mental disorder, which may exhibit itself in any of the behaviours listed in the amendment.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0707025000157"></a>There is therefore a risk that the exclusions would have no legal effect. They might, however, create room for doubt about what is and is not meant. That is not meant as a criticism of those who drafted or supported the noble Earl&#146;s amendment. I hope that noble Lords will understand from my response that I quite understand the importance of the principles that inform the debate on exclusions but we have concerns about the practical impact that those will have.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0707025000158"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has tabled an amendment dealing with discrimination, which from my experience of debating the Bill with noble Lords is a critical area of concern. The Government will support it. It deals with an important matter. The noble Baroness has drafted it in a way that allows us to make it clear to practitioners that this is an important principle but does not cause a problem in terms of the original drafting of the exclusions. I thank noble Lords for the constructive way in which we have debated the matter.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0707025000161"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Minister began by talking about how the debates in this House had had a great influence on the debates that subsequently followed in another place. That is true. However, this amendment and several of those that will follow this afternoon reflect the fact that there remains between the two Houses and between the Government and the whole of the Opposition some fundamental disagreement about the legislation&#146;s purpose and application.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0707025000162"></a>To go back to arguments held in this House and another place recently about principles in mental health legislation and about exclusions, we still believe that overall the Bill significantly changes the balance of the Mental Health Act 1983 away from the rights and protection of patients, which we believe are in the interests of public safety, towards giving greater power towards clinicians. The amendment moved at an earlier stage by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, was an attempt to clarify again the purpose of mental health legislation. With that amendment and with this one we were following statements made by Professor Genevra Richardson&#146;s expert committee and by the Mental Health Act Commission 2004, which said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0707025000361"></a>&#147;for the law to be of value&#151;to patients, State administrators, mental health professionals, the police, the courts or the Tribunal&#151;its meaning cannot rest upon the discretion of those working within its framework. We do not find it difficult to envisage the inappropriate use, however well meant, of mental health legislation for non-medical purposes of social control&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000349"></a>That has been the concern at the heart of the debates. </p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0707025000163"></a>The debates in this House were more to the point than those in another place. I must confess that I found the debates on these matters in another place at times almost distressing. The flippancy with which some Members of another place addressed the underlying issues was not edifying. The Minister was right to pay tribute to those of us in this House who, albeit sometimes in inelegant ways, have attempted to find a way to give expression to the principles to which we subscribe not only in this House and in legislation, but which are commonly held throughout society. It remains a concern to me that there has been so much resistance from a very small section of the mental health profession who feel unable to subscribe to a set of standards that are now common in practically every area of life. Commercial companies now have long lists of equality statements. Every public authority has a list of duties. I do not understand why this should cause such turmoil to some members of the psychiatric profession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0707025000164"></a>We have had some rather spurious arguments during our debates. Why it should prove to be impossible&#151;the word that has been used&#151;for parliamentary counsel to draft a list of exclusions for this Parliament is difficult to understand. We have quoted exemplary legislation from around the world&#151;from Scotland, New South Wales, Victoria and New Zealand&#151;in which there are list of exclusions that go with definitions of mental health. They are clearly understood and have not posed the major problems that might enable a legal challenge by

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0707025000165"></a>Inevitably, at this stage of a Bill, we arrive at a point where principle goes against the tough daylight of pragmatism. I say that in order to explain to the many people outside, who have followed our debates with great intensity and great care, why those of us who believe this to be a matter of such importance will now sign up to something which we acknowledge is less than satisfactory, which it is. We believe that we will be making a statement, which, as the Minister said, may be declaratory, about what mental health legislation should be in our society now and that society should treat with decency and dignity people whose behaviour is different and, sometimes, difficult and challenging.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0707025000166"></a>The amendment standing in my name, which I understand has support from around the House, is important, but it is not perfect. For example, it does not deal with the matters raised by the Government at the beginning of the passage of the Bill about paraphilia; nor does it deal with the important issue of belief. In this day and age, how people choose to express their beliefs is becoming increasingly important for society and for mental health professionals. We already have people detained under mental health legislation, at least in part because of their beliefs.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0707025000167"></a>I believe that it is important for us to state that there will be exclusions for people on the basis of their religious beliefs and sexual orientation. Why? This country remains part of the tradition of modernisation of mental health legislation. We led the way and we continue to have a part to play in setting standards for ourselves. These are recognised around the world and, for the past 100 years or so, have changed how people with mental health problems have been viewed and how their rights have been extended.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0707025000168"></a>Some of the debates in another place were disappointing in that they were conducted by people who had clearly forgotten some of the many abuses in the mental health services in this country, where there are still people who were subjected in the past to wrongful application of compulsory mental health treatment. I meet some of them in the course of my work and, although they are now very old, one does not have to be a professional to see the long and lingering damage that a misapplication of mental health treatment can do to people just because they happen to be different.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0707025000169"></a>Imperfect though this amendment is, I believe that it is important not only as a declaratory statement but in practice, if only to serve to say to mental health professionals that their judgment will continue to be subject to scrutiny. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, as he disappears, that it was in part his early speeches in our debate about the lack of exclusion for people with learning disabilities that fired up those of us who kept going in the face of opposition from the Government.</p>

<a name="0707025000172"></a><b><a name="70702-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0707025000501"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, perhaps I could begin by posing two detailed questions about Amendment No. 1A and its precise effects. My concern, which perhaps the Minister, as well as the noble Baroness, would like to comment on, is whether in deciding if someone should be detained or not, the responsible clinician needs to consider whether, let us say, an expression of religious belief is a sign of an underlying mental disorder. Does the amendment mean that the patient could appeal against an order on the grounds that he was being detained because of his religious belief rather than a mental disorder? That was one of the key points that the earlier amendment was trying to get at and I would like some reassurance that this amendment, limited as it is, would get us into the same kind of territory.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0707025000173"></a>This amendment is certainly to be supported although it is, as we know, a pale shadow of the amendment that was passed by your Lordships at an earlier stage. The Government said that the previous amendment was absolutely unacceptable to them. However, the point of it can be expressed very simply. It was to signal in statute a clear warning to clinicians about making wrong assumptions about the presence of a mental disorder in a patient where no such disorder actually exists.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0707025000174"></a>Contrary to the frequently expressed views of Ministers, this was not an outlandish proposal. The Bill itself contains an exclusion relating to drug and alcohol dependency. What is the point of that exclusion? It is to ensure that, before detaining somebody under the Mental Health Act, the clinician asks himself whether the behaviour of the person before him is attributable to something other than a mental illness. These concerns matter a great deal, and not just in the context of drug and alcohol dependency; they matter in particular to black and ethnic minority patients who, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, have a deep-seated and, many would say, justified fear of what the mental health system may do to them. They fear that the system is loaded against them and that clinicians who do not understand black culture and some of the religious practices that black people engage in may misinterpret the behaviour that is often integral to those practices and cultures. Influential and highly respected doctors assert that there is no institutional racism in mental health services. I do not know  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_818"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 818</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether that view is right or wrong. I hope that it is right but, even if it is, the reality that we have to deal with&#151;the one that matters&#151;is the perception among black people that institutional racism does exist.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0707025000175"></a>We need to do something that is more than just a gesture if we are to have any hope of assuaging those concerns. That is why this limited amendment, welcome as it is, needs to be accompanied by full and appropriate explanatory guidance in the code of practice. It is not just a case of saying in the guidance, &#147;Do not discriminate unfairly against black people&#148;. It is necessary to set out what actually goes on in clinical practice in order to explain why this provision exists and why it is thought to be important. Some of the disparities between the treatment of black patients and that of white patients cannot be explained merely by genetic differences. Rates of detention for defined groups of black people have been recorded as being up to 18 times the national average. Rates of prescribing of old-fashioned anti-psychotics are greater for black people than for whites, and at higher doses than they should have in relation to their different metabolism. The rates of referral for psychotherapy are much lower for blacks than for whites. Why is that? Clinicians need to understand what some of their number are doing in the name of medical treatment and ask themselves the right questions before they detain someone under compulsion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0707025000176"></a>These are the reasons why I and other noble Lords were so exercised about the amendment that we passed on Report, and they are why I hope that the Minister will agree to include within the code of practice a section that clearly sets out Parliament&#146;s concern on these matters and how doctors should respond to that concern when exercising their clinical judgment.</p>

Many in this House and the other place have spoken passionately and at great length about the inequalities that exist for certain minority ethnic groups in our mental health system; the Minister and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, have said the same. Regrettably, I cannot see what we have done in all our discussions and amendments to the Bill that will even begin to rectify or alleviate the situation. Despite our best efforts, there are no principles set out in the Bill, something that I and many others would have liked to see. That would have been one small step towards reassuring those in the black and minority ethnic communities, along with all those delivering mental health services, that we are serious about addressing these failings. Although the amendment before us falls far short of that, it is essential, as it will go some way towards ensuring that the Act is applied with due concern for non-discriminatory principles regarding religion, culture and sexual orientation, although the issue about belief is missing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0707025000178"></a>I want to raise one specific issue to follow on from the noble Earl, Lord Howe. We are all aware that, under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, all proposed legislation on equality has to undergo a race equality impact assessment&#151;a REIA&#151;to pre-empt  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_819"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 819</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the possibility that the proposed policy could affect some racial groups unfavourably. While it is true that the Government have published an REIA on the Bill, we know from the published letter from the Commission for Racial Equality to the Department of Health that the CRE has consistently raised grave reservations about the adequacy of this assessment. The letter says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0707025000362"></a>&#147;At each stage of the process of discussion between the Commission and the Department, the Commission has made the Department of Health aware of its concerns regarding the REIA and its potential impact upon the provisions of the Bill&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000350"></a>The commission identifies a number of these concerns, not least the wholesale absence of specific service data, the distinct lack of monitoring and the failure to address potential adverse impacts arising from changes to the Mental Health Act. The commission&#146;s letter also says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0707025000363"></a>&#147;The Commission&#146;s considered view is that the Department has not adequately considered the impact of the proposals in line with the duty to have due regard to eliminate unlawful discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and good race relations&#148;.</p>
</ul><a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="70702-0003.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="0707025000402"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0707025000179"></a>It is true that Department of Health officials began a process of consultation on the REIA. However, due to a lack of time and, I believe, poor planning, this resulted in a number of major disagreements, not least about the process of consultation and engagement with black and minority ethnic communities and key agencies. In an attempt to resolve the situation and to move matters forward, the Department of Health established an advisory group, consisting of a number of eminent professionals, to advise on the final REIA. I was asked to chair that group, and I must declare that interest.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0707025000180"></a>Despite the lack of time, the group produced a series of important recommendations that, if taken into proper account in the final published REIA, would have gone a long way towards reassuring communities and services that the department was serious about addressing these issues. Suffice it to say that many of our views and recommendations&#151;one of which was to establish a royal commission&#151;were not taken into account when the final REIA was published.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0707025000181"></a>These matters are well known to many noble Lords, but it has only recently come to light that the Commission for Racial Equality had also expressed serious concerns. I have to wonder whether, had we known of the CRE letter earlier, this would have affected our deliberations or, indeed, those in the other place.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0707025000182"></a>However, we are where we are. It would be helpful if the Minister reaffirmed for the record that, notwithstanding the criticisms of the CRE, it is the intention of the Government that this Act should not have discriminatory effects on racial&#151;or, for that matter, any other&#151;grounds. It is for these reasons that I support this amendment, although the matter is unlikely to end here. There is a great deal of concern about these matters among communities and professionals. I am well aware that the National BME Mental Health Network, which consists of carers,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_820"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 820</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>service users, communities and eminent mental health professionals, will be actively campaigning for a judicial review on these very issues.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0707025000183"></a>I believe that we need a national committee of inquiry, if not a royal commission, in order to determine once and for all what lies behind the significant and worrying disproportion and differing treatment of black and minority ethnic patients, and to put to an end the mischief making of some academics in the field, who are attempting to discredit the whole concept of institutional racism.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0707025000184"></a>I am conscious of the time, but I am also aware that this may be our last opportunity to raise these important issues in relation to the Bill. In supporting the amendment, I hope that I make my view clear that much more action is needed. We need to know that something will finally be done to address the scandalous situation of black and minority ethnic patients, their carers and families.</p>

I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that from the start of our debate there have clearly been some fundamental disagreements. The purpose of our deliberations has been, in a sense, to try to find a way through in order to ensure that those issues are fully debated. In a considerable number of cases, changes have been made to the legislation to reflect some of those concerns. I do not agree with the noble Baroness about the shift of balance from the individual patient to the clinician. The safeguards contained within the legislation are strong and will ensure that that does not happen.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0707025000186"></a>I accept that, in the context of the law, the practice of practitioners and clinicians will be critical. It is incumbent on the Department of Health to ensure as effective a programme as possible, so that clinicians understand the law as it has been amended and the practice that is required.</p>

<a name="70702-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0707025000187"></a>The Bill is well intentioned and has been improved. The agreement that we reached in your Lordships&#146; House on how to ensure that principles appeared on the face of the Bill, albeit linked to the code of practice, was an acceptable way of ensuring that the legislation was as practicable as possible and reflected the clear desire of many stakeholders to see principles on the face of the Bill. That is why I very much welcome the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, which seeks to improve and enhance that statement of principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0707025000188"></a>There has been some debate about why in some jurisdictions it is possible to put exclusions on the face of legislation and why in others it is not. That is rather like our debates on House of Lords reform, where it is possible to find legislatures that have different experiences. It is possible to trawl the world to find examples that support one&#146;s own case&#151;for instance, in a province of Canada it is not the norm to have such exclusions&#151;but, frankly, that is not a helpful exercise, particularly at this very late stage of debate. Jurisdictions are different. The strong advice that we have received is that what is proposed would not be considered good law in the tradition of this  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_821"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 821</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Parliament and its jurisdiction because of the risk, to which I have referred, of confusion and misinterpretation by professionals. One of the key points in our debates has been to ensure that professionals in the field, who deal with incredibly difficult challenges on a daily basis, are as clear as possible as to what the law is.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0707025000189"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, referred to the advice and guidance that would be given to practitioners in this area. This is already touched on in the illustrative code for England. Paragraph 1B.5 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0707025000364"></a>&#147;Disordered beliefs are sometimes symptoms of clinically recognised mental disorders, but in the absence of such a disorder no-one may be considered to be mentally disordered solely because of their political or cultural beliefs, values or opinions ... A person&#146;s sexual orientation does not, by itself, indicate the presence or absence of mental disorder; nor does involvement, or likely involvement, in illegal, anti-social or &#145;immoral&#146; behaviour. Beliefs, behaviours or actions which do not result from a disorder or disability of the mind are not a basis for determining that any of the conditions is met, even if they appear unusual or cause other people alarm or distress&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000351"></a>I realise that there is much more to be said. We will be looking seriously at the drafting and seeking ideas on how it can be improved. The codes, of course, will be subject to formal consultation, both in England and in Wales. I have no doubt that the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, will help to set an appropriate context for the implementation of the Act as informed by the code. I shall invite my successor to commit to a willingness to engage with individual noble Lords on the code because clearly, from the quality of our debates, they have a great deal to offer.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0707025000190"></a>The answer to the question of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about an appeal is implied in what I read out of what is already in the draft code. Clearly a patient can appeal&#151;he will still be able to&#151;and argue before a tribunal that they do not have a mental disorder and that their religious beliefs have been mistaken for disorder. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0707025000191"></a>I well understand the passion with which noble Lords referred to their concerns about the disproportionate detention rates of people from black and minority ethnic communities, although the reasons for that are not established. I note the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Patel, on that matter. It is entirely understandable that many people in these communities believe, from their own experience or that of others, that at least part of the explanation lies in the legislation being at best applied carelessly and at worst actually being abused. Of course, I understand the question about institutionalised racism that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, raised. However, I take issue with his reference to mischief making by officials. Since 5 January, I have had the great joy of working with a considerable number of people concerned with mental health in the department and I have been enormously impressed by their commitment, experience, skill and integrity. I pay tribute to them.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0707025000192"></a>I do not think that, in reality, the issue concerns the words in an Act. We come back to a point that I have made consistently&#151;that while the Act sets the context, the real question is how we ensure that  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_822"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 822</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>practice is acceptable and non-discriminatory. I very much echo the words of all noble Lords who have spoken on that. I have no doubt that we shall respond in the affirmative to the request of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for the code&#146;s advice on discrimination to clinicians in the field to be very clear and deliberate.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0707025000193"></a>There has been considerable debate and correspondence between the Department of Health and the CRE, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said. I do not think that he wishes me to go through the ifs and buts and the backwards and forwards. The Department of Health and the Government wish to ensure as strong and close a relationship as possible with the CRE. Whatever has gone before, we want to ensure that the expertise and experience of the CRE is brought to bear in the development of future health policy and practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0707025000194"></a>On Thursday, there was a great deal of discussion about the Mental Health Bill and I had the privilege of meeting representatives of black churches. They are represented here in the Gallery. It was a very lively and moving meeting. In accepting the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, I assure her that I fully understand the concerns of the black and minority ethnic communities and that we shall do everything that we can to ensure that services meet the needs of all our communities, are fair and impartial and are implemented in the best possible way in the interests of the public and individual patients.</p>

He has given us the greatest possible support and understanding, as well as his knowledge in the world of disability, over the past few months and, indeed, before that. We shall miss him greatly, as we shall miss the noble Baroness who is now the Leader of the House in responses to us on the Mental Health Bill and on other Bills concerning people with disability. I wish them both the greatest possible success in their new jobs, and I thank all concerned in the Government for taking such a keen interest in and having such an understanding of the amendments that came from your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

That is my luck. I have three points. First, I thank the Minister for his explanations, but we on this side of the House believe that the words in legislation are critical in determining culture and practice. That is why we have returned and time and again to these matters, and that is why we are where we are today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0707025000198"></a>Secondly, I thank him for his suggestion that noble Lords should be invited to comment on the code of practice. Throughout our debates, all of us have realised the importance of that. Given the considerable experience in this House, which has brought much to our debates, will it be possible to engage noble Lords in discussion of the regulations that will undoubtedly follow the Bill? That will be an important part of the process.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0707025000199"></a>Finally, there is review. The points forcefully made by the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, were important. What will matter above all else is that in future there should be a body of independent research on which legislators can build. This legislation has suffered in many ways from the lack of a reliable evidence base on which to found legislation. I hope that that will happen, given all that we have learnt&#151;we have learnt much in the passage of this Bill. If at some stage the department can give an assurance that independent research will be made available, in years to come we will receive what we have not yet managed in this Bill: mental health legislation that is fit for this century. I thank all noble Lords for their support on these matters.</p>

This takes us back to another matter that has already been debated extensively in your Lordships&#146; House and in the other place. As your Lordships will recall, the House inserted a clause on impaired decision-making into the Bill, which was passed to the other place on 7 March. The proposal to include an impaired decision-making test in the criteria for detention has now been debated in the other place, which removed it from the Bill.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0707025000203"></a>The new clauses that were removed from the Bill in the other place would have introduced a fundamental change not only to the Bill but also to the approach taken in mental health legislation. They would have required the needs of patients and the risks posed by their mental disorder to be subordinated to their decision-making ability. The primary purpose of the Mental Health Act is to provide an effective, properly safeguarded mechanism by which clinicians can intervene to protect people from the risks that arise from mental disorder, not because they have made a judgment about the person&#146;s ability to make informed decisions but because it is necessary to protect them or others from harm. Accepting those amendments would have meant abandoning one of the most fundamental objectives of the Act, namely that compulsory intervention should be based on need and risk. As my honourable friend the Member for Stafford pointed out in Committee in the other place, there has been no obvious change since previous Mental Health Acts in 1959 and 1983 that would require this long-standing principle to be changed. We cannot accept that it should be changed, yet that would have been the effect of this proposed new test.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_824"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 824</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70702-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0707025000204"></a>I know that some proponents of an impaired decision-making clause have said that the law and the state have no business interfering in the lives of patients who retain decision-making capacity, despite being seriously ill, if the risk they pose is only to themselves. Yet others have said, quite definitely, that if a person is at a serious risk of suicide their decision-making is necessarily impaired. I appreciate that some noble Lords and the British Psychological Society have said openly that what they see as the greater autonomy for patients that the test would have brought would have been right, even if it meant that some people killed themselves as a result.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0707025000205"></a>I respect the honesty and sincerity of those views, but do not agree. We are not alone. The Royal College of Nursing, for example, has said it could not support any legislation that could impede its members in their primary aim of preventing foreseeable harm. A number of leading clinicians have written to us expressing their concerns. The honourable Member for Southport, in Committee in the other place, was so concerned to establish the true intention of the impaired decision-making test that he asked a number of leading organisations whether someone could be judged a serious danger to themselves and others because they are mentally ill, yet still be possessed of unimpaired judgment. He reported that the answers he received flatly contradicted each other. For example, the Law Society and British Association of Social Workers said that it could not happen, while the British Medical Association and the British Psychological Society said it was entirely possible. On the basis of those and other answers that he received, he worried that, as legislators, he and his colleagues were not able to be clear about the effect that an impaired decision-making test would have.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0707025000206"></a>This is an important point that the proponents of the new test have to resolve before any responsible Government could accept it. The fact that there were so many different views about the effects of this test lends weight to the argument that it would have been a shot in the dark, fraught with the risk of unexpected and unintended consequences.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0707025000207"></a>We should remember that this proposal was not just about the risk of self-harm. Of course most people&#146;s mental disorders, even when severe, pose no danger to anyone except themselves, but sometimes there is a risk to other people, unfortunately. No one has convinced us that because a person has a mental disorder which makes them prone to violence against other people it necessarily follows that they have impaired decision-making. A point made to my ministerial colleague, the then Minster of State for Health Services, Rosie Winterton, in a recent letter from a number of senior psychiatrists was that,</p>
<ul><a name="0707025000377"></a>&#147;while impaired thinking is a common feature of mental disorder, impairment of the ability to make treatment decisions specifically is not, of itself, a criterion for diagnosing mental disorder, or any particular mental disorder&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70702-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0707025000208"></a>One of the signatories to that letter was Dr Kevin Murray, associate medical director of Broadmoor. If there were such a test in the relevant criteria and the clinicians could not be sure that the patient&#146;s decision-making was significantly impaired, that would be that. The history of violence and assessment  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_825"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 825</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of future risk would have been irrelevant. If the patient could not have been persuaded to accept treatment voluntarily, the clinicians could have done nothing.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0707025000209"></a>Again, I acknowledge that not everyone sees that as a problem. The view has been expressed in debate that if a patient&#146;s decision-making is unimpaired, any risk that they pose to other people should be a matter for the criminal justice system. The problem with that view is that if there is no possibility of compulsory clinical intervention to prevent the violence, with all its implications, an action would have to wait until after an offence had been committed. That does not seem to me to be a very preventive approach.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0707025000210"></a>I know that this matter has exercised noble Lords considerably. The Government have given it considerable attention and it has been fully debated in the other place, but I have to say that we are not persuaded to move on it.</p>

<a name="0707025000212"></a><b><a name="70702-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0707025000507"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, I should like to say a few words on this amendment in the context of the Bill as a whole. It would be wrong to let this occasion pass without, from these Benches, a short word of appreciation to the Minister, whose last appearance at the Dispatch Box as a Health Minister this may be.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0707025000213"></a>I thank the noble Lord for his personal contribution to the way this Bill has been successfully amended during its passage through both Houses. The amendments passed in another place, which I hope will be approved by your Lordships today, represent individually and collectively a vast improvement on the Bill that we were first presented with. The changes made in such areas as general principles, age-appropriate services for children and young people, advocacy, renewal of detention, ECT, and of course the definition of appropriate medical treatment&#151;to name only the most salient issues&#151;are most welcome. I firmly believe that we have a much better Bill as a result of these changes. It is right to acknowledge that the Government have listened and responded constructively to the concerns raised from many quarters. I thank them for that. I also thank the members of the Mental Health Alliance, in particular Professor Zigmond and Dr Daw, whose professional advice I have drawn upon throughout the Bill.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0707025000214"></a>At the same time, however, there is a sense of regret. The sadness is that Ministers and we on this side of the House should have approached the task of amending the Mental Health Act from two different perspectives, which in the final analysis have not been reconciled. I say very readily that this is a better Bill, but it is also a lost opportunity. The Millan Committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0707025000366"></a>&#147;It should not be the function of mental health law to impose treatment on those who are clearly able to make decisions for themselves&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000352"></a>That principle has been the subject of much high-level support over the years. It is the reason why we sought, unsuccessfully, to persuade the Government that a  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_826"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 826</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>test of impaired decision-making would do more to bring mental health services into the modern world than just about any other change. As it is we are, in a real sense, back in the world of Enoch Powell and 1959. Patient empowerment and respect for the wishes of the patient are acknowledged features of good clinical practice in all other areas of healthcare&#151;but not, it seems, in mental health. It is true that some amendments passed in another place, such as those on advocacy and ECT, tip their cap to the principle of patient empowerment. Finding a way through this issue would have been the way to show that we wanted to banish the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness. The Government were not willing to engage in that discussion&#151;I, for one, am very saddened by that.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0707025000215"></a>In this, as in other ways, the whole approach of the Bill views mentally ill people as patients who need compulsory treatment for their own good, whether they like it or not. Compulsion is, of course, necessary for many patients. But we need to remember&#151;I do not think that some doctors always do&#151;that it should always be a last resort. The Government say that every limitation on the ability of doctors to detain patients against their will has the effect of preventing those patients receiving the treatment that they need. To put the matter in those terms, however, presupposes that compulsion is the only means by which effective treatment can be delivered. Of course, it is not: good treatment is available without compulsion, and the fear of some of us is that the wider the gateway to compulsion and the easier the law makes it to get people through it, the less likely it is that those who need help will come forward to ask for it. To have acknowledged in law that there is a place for the wishes and feelings of patients who are capable of making their own choices would have been a profoundly far-sighted and beneficial change. Never let us forget the anguish, trauma and humiliation involved in subjecting a patient to compulsion&#151;and never let us forget, as the RCN has emphasised, that compulsion should never be seen as a substitute for good healthcare.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0707025000216"></a>So we bid farewell to this Bill with mixed emotions&#151;a mixture of apprehension, disappointment, gratitude and relief. It is to be hoped that the revision of the draft code of practice and the professionalism of the generality of mental health practitioners, which we are firmly told can be relied on, will make the practical implementation of the Bill something that we can all be proud of.</p>

Having debated&#151;I am not sure whether &#147;shadowed&#148; is the word&#151;with him for four years, and now a further five months, I must say that he has made a really fine contribution to your Lordships&#146; House. He certainly kept me on my mettle as a Health Minister with the intellectual robustness with which he brings arguments to your Lordships&#146; House. I pay tribute to him for that and for the service that he gives to the whole House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0707025000218"></a>The noble Earl commented on the Bill as a whole and talked about two different perspectives; I want to respond. Coming late to this, noble Lords will remember that I made a Statement in, I think, 2001 announcing that the Government were to bring forward legislation. Since then, there has been considerable argument and debate. Some of the concerns that have been expressed about the Bill very much reflect the debate around the original discussions, going back to the beginning of this decade.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0707025000219"></a>I do not disagree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, one iota about the importance of respect for patients or that compulsion is very much a last resort. The argument that we still have is that he implies that compulsion has become easier under this legislation, but I do not agree. I believe that the Act contains very strong safeguards. I accept that within the context of the Act, the question is: how well do professionals operate in dealing with individual patients? That surely brings us together in terms of work on the code. I fully accept the challenge of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, of wishing to ensure that Members of your Lordships&#146; House are able to contribute to draft regulations in future. We must come together again and ensure that the legislation works to the best interests of patients and the public. I assure noble Lords that the Government wish to work very warmly with all stakeholders to, in a sense, put aside some of the disagreements to ensure that the legislation is good and, above all, that there are good services for people with mental illness in this country; we all want that.</p>

I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 5 to 9, 15 to 18, 20, 22 to 30, 43 to 52, 54, 55, 57, 59 to 61, 63, 64, 67, 69, 70 to 72, 74, 77 to 100, 107 and 108. Some of them address amendments that were discussed, often passionately, in this House when the Bill was first before us; others make a series of technical improvements.</p>

<a name="70702-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0707025000222"></a>Amendments Nos. 3, 5 and 6 restore the original wording of the Bill&#146;s references to &#147;appropriate medical treatment&#148;. Amendment No. 3 refers to the criteria for detention for treatment under Section 3 of the 1983 Act. Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 make similar changes in relation to the role of second opinion advisory doctors (SOADs) in confirming that it is appropriate for certain medical treatments to be given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0707025000224"></a>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9 do that by making explicit the purpose of medical treatment for mental disorder and so providing further clarification on the effect of the &#147;appropriate medical treatment&#148; test.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0707025000225"></a>I am pleased that there was all-party agreement in the other place to these amendments, tabled by my honourable friend Chris Bryant. The word &#147;purpose&#148; was felt to be better than &#147;intention&#148;, and the word &#147;manifestations&#148; did not have the same risk of misinterpretation that noble Lords identified with the term &#147;effects&#148;. The Government have listened carefully, and I have no hesitation in commending the result to your Lordships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0707025000226"></a>Important improvements have been made to the safeguards afforded to children. Clause 24, inserted by this House, was removed by Amendment No. 15 as it did not provide sufficient flexibility. However, we have considered further the issue of age-appropriate services for children and young people following the debates in this House and the other place. Amendment No. 30 is the result. We are most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, for laying the initial amendment on this subject and for his help in thinking through the important issues. His positive attitude and his customary determination have carried us a long way.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0707025000227"></a>Amendment No. 30 has cross-party support and will ensure that patients aged under 18 are detained in a hospital environment that is suitable for their age, subject to their needs. The word &#147;environment&#148; ensures that children and young people should have separate and appropriate physical facilities, staff with the right training to understand and address their specific needs as children, and a hospital routine that will allow their personal, social and educational development to continue as normally as possible.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0707025000228"></a>We have not set out a commencement date in the Bill. We believe that it would not be productive because we would have to veer on the side of caution and thus send a mixed message to the NHS. However, our aim is to implement the provision fully in England by around April 2010. Amendment No. 74 provides the necessary flexibility to allow, for example, that new Section 131A be commenced in relation to Part 2 and informal patients in England as soon as resources allow, rather than having to wait until it can be commenced for Part 2, informal, and Part 3 patients in England.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0707025000229"></a>Amendment No. 69 was tabled by my honourable friend Madeleine Moon in the other place, and we thank her for doing so. The amendment increases safeguards for 16 and 17 year-olds by ensuring that their cases are referred to a tribunal by the hospital managers after one year, rather than the current three years, where the patient has not used their right to apply or if their case has not otherwise come before the tribunal.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0707025000230"></a>This House amended the Bill to include provision for detained patients to refuse ECT, except in emergencies, where they have the capacity to do so. At that time the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble

Many noble Lords wished to see stronger safeguards on those few occasions when children are treated with ECT. We promised that we would consider the issues further. We did so and brought forward a number of amendments in the other place. As a result, the Bill has been further amended so that no child or young person under 18, whether detained or an informal patient, may be given ECT for their mental disorder without it being approved as appropriate for them by a second opinion appointed doctor. Amendments Nos. 47 to 52, 57, 61, 64 and 67 achieve that.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0707025000231"></a>In addition, Amendments Nos. 16 to 18, 22 to 24, 26, 27, 43 and 45 provide that, where the treatment is to be given on the basis of the young person&#146;s own consent, a SOAD must also certify that the patient can, and does, consent to it.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0707025000232"></a>We listened carefully to concerns and agreed that ECT is not a treatment that should be given urgently in order to control a patient&#146;s behaviour or relieve suffering. Amendments Nos. 25, 54, 55, 59 and 60 provide that the circumstances in which urgent treatment with ECT can be given in the absence of a SOAD certificate are now restricted to when the patient needs the treatment in order to save their life or to prevent a serious deterioration in their condition.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0707025000233"></a>Members of this House spoke passionately in earlier debates about the need for patients to have access to advocates. Your Lordships will recall debating amendments from the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, and my noble friend Lady Howells&#146;s amendment in Committee about advocacy for all child patients.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0707025000234"></a>We considered this issue carefully and believe that the Government&#146;s Amendments Nos. 29 and 100 are the right vehicles for establishing independent mental health advocates to be available to qualifying patients. These advocates, in the process of providing help and support to patients, will be able to meet them in private and meet those professionally concerned with the patient&#146;s medical treatment.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0707025000235"></a>Many noble Lords and Members in the other place spoke of the need for specialist advocacy provision for particular groups of patients. A regulation-making power will ensure that specialist skills in addition to core competencies in advocacy can be provided for.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0707025000236"></a>With the exception of a small number of technical amendments, all the amendments to the new deprivation of liberty safeguards to be inserted in the Mental Capacity Act have been brought forward to fulfil commitments made by the Government in response to debates in this House. The new deprivation of liberty safeguards are needed for people who lack capacity to consent to arrangements made for their care. The cornerstone of the new arrangements is that deprivation of liberty will be lawful only if it is permitted by a formal authorisation or by a Court of Protection order.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0707025000237"></a>If an authorisation to deprive a person of liberty is granted, the period is set on the basis of the best-interests assessor&#146;s recommendation on how long  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_830"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 830</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it should last but cannot be longer than 12 months. We are making it clear in the Mental Capacity Act code of practice and in training materials that the period set must be the shortest possible.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0707025000238"></a>To allay concerns that 12 months would become the default period for authorisation, my noble friend the Leader of the House committed to take a power to reduce the maximum authorisation period at a future date if monitoring of the operation of the safeguards provides convincing evidence that it is necessary to do so. Amendments Nos. 72, 79 and 98 achieve this. We will keep the length of authorisations granted under review.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0707025000239"></a>My noble friend Lady Ashton also committed the Government to consider whether more advocacy support was needed for people who are deprived of their liberty. We have considered the matter, and Amendments Nos. 80, 82, 83, 86 to 90, 93, 94 and 99 give the person deprived of liberty, or their representative, the statutory right of access to an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA), who will explain to them the authorisation for the deprivation of liberty and provide support with a review or with an application to the Court of Protection.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0707025000240"></a>Section 40 of the Mental Capacity Act provides that an IMCA is not required to be appointed in specified situations. Amendments Nos. 71 and 95 to 97 provide for IMCAs in additional circumstances and limit the exceptions under Section 40. Amendments Nos. 81, 85 and 91 were introduced by the Government to make technical changes to the wording used to refer to applications to the Court of Protection and do not alter in any way the rights of the person concerned.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0707025000241"></a>Amendment No. 84 relates to one made on Report in this House and would further require the person concerned to be informed by the supervisory body that a request has been made to assess whether they are being deprived of liberty, whether an assessor has been appointed, the name of the assessor and the outcome of the assessment.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0707025000242"></a>Amendment No. 91 provides an easy reference point for definitions of terms used in connection with the deprivation of liberty safeguards. It does not alter the safeguards in any way but is purely technical. However, it will make the legislation easier to use.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0707025000243"></a>In the other place, the Government introduced Amendments Nos. 70 and 78 to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. They extended the rights of victims to receive information and make representations about offenders who receive unrestricted hospital orders. Currently, these rights are only available to victims of convicted offenders who receive a hospital disposal subject to special restrictions.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0707025000244"></a>My right honourable friend in another place paid tribute to the work of the Zito Trust and Victims&#146; Voice, and I would like to do so also. Their advice has been invaluable to us in understanding and addressing victims&#146; concerns. These amendments are the result. They show the importance that the Government attach to involving victims, and their proper concerns, in the process of managing mental disorder.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0707025000245"></a>The Government also tabled further detailed amendments to improve and clarify the safeguards for patients in the Act. Amendment No. 46 makes clear that certificates for child community patients apply when a patient is recalled to hospital or their CTO is revoked, in the same way as the equivalent certificates for adults. Amendment No. 63 provides that the appropriate national authority is able to require that the approved clinician in charge of treatment provide a report on treatment given under the authority of a SOAD certificate issued under Part 4A and on the condition of the patient concerned. It already has this power in relation to certificates issued in respect of detained patients.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0707025000246"></a>Amendment No. 28 clarifies what happens when a patient&#146;s capacity to consent to treatment changes after a statutory certificate has been issued. Amendment No. 44 corrects a small gap in the 1983 Act to ensure that no offender patient detained by a court in a place of safety pending admission to hospital can be treated under compulsion.</p>

We have listened to the views of stakeholders and debated at length in the other place. We accepted amendments in the other place and brought forward our own. In doing so, we have addressed the many issues raised in this House. The Bill now makes explicit that medical treatment for mental disorder must be for the purpose of alleviating or preventing a deterioration of the disorder, its symptoms or manifestations. We have provided that children will be treated in appropriate environments, and have extended strengthened ECT safeguards to informal child patients. We have provided that advocacy services will be available to all patients subject to compulsion under the Mental Health Act, and extended advocacy to persons subject to a deprivation of liberty under the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0707025000252"></a>I welcome the fact that the amendment makes explicitly clear that help is available to patients. These things can be easily forgotten and there are specific provisions that protect and facilitate effective advocacy, such as interviews in private, access to records, and so on. That is very welcome.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0707025000253"></a>I also welcome new Section 130D in the 1983 Act, which provides the duty to give information to ensure that a qualifying patient knows what help is available and where he can obtain it. It is very explicit; the text is fully comprehensible; it is always welcome to read in legislation something that is fully comprehensible. The Government have responded well to what we proposed earlier&#151;by we, I include resolute campaigner, the noble Baroness, Lady Howells of St Davids, who is in the House, who has always worked very hard on the issue. I am glad to see her here and glad that we have made progress together.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0707025000254"></a>I turn now to the issue of age-appropriate accommodation facilities for those under 18. Our first requirement for this issue was that it be in the Bill. It is in the Bill; it applies to all those under 18 and there is a provision for consultation by hospital managers with someone who has knowledge of cases involving children. Those three elements were in the original amendment passed in this House and we are glad to see that they have come through unscathed.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0707025000255"></a>I also welcome the fact that there are new provisions about ensuring that the courts and social services should be informed where there is age appropriate accommodation available. This would avoid people being shunted around or held somewhere because they could not find the age appropriate accommodation. That is a practical point of considerable importance.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0707025000256"></a>My last point is on timing. Once again, we heard what the Minister said in the other House. We understand that this cannot necessarily be brought in instantly but we are anxious that it should come in quickly because it is a response to something that was previously unsatisfactory and we want to get it into place as soon as possible. We are all campaigners for that.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0707025000257"></a>Finally, I welcome the fact that the Bill started with main provisions, about which there was some dispute, and to which changes were proposed. These two amendments are slightly different; they are amendments which improve the current system, irrespective of other changes in the mental health world. That is what we wanted to achieve and what we have here, so I join others in thanking all the Ministers who have dealt with this. Whether they are still in health or wherever they have gone to&#151;they have moved around quite a bit and I have not quite caught up with them all yet&#151;their legacy is very much welcomed by me and others.</p>

They concern issues I raised at Second Reading but I was then debilitated by a virus and prevented from joining my noble friend Lord Williamson in what I think is his triumphant campaign to get this in the Bill. I congratulate him on that.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0707025000259"></a>However, I add some disappointment about the timing. At Second Reading I mentioned that the Minister in the other place had said that efforts were already being made to prevent children being inappropriately placed in adult mental institutions. I therefore hope that I misheard the Minister, although I probably did not, that those are to be brought in by 2010. I hope that we are going to bring it in as soon as possible and that it was the other measure which was 2010 because it is absolutely crucial that we move rapidly towards that. However, I congratulate the Front Bench on getting children into this Bill when they were nowhere near it at the beginning.</p>

I congratulate him warmly on the success of his dogged campaign. I have a question on Amendment No. 9 which deals with the definition of medical treatment. It is an extremely important amendment.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0707025000261"></a>The Minister said that the word &#147;manifestations&#148; in the amendment does not provide the same scope for misinterpretation as the House identified with the word &#147;effects&#148;. Can the Minister confirm that &#147;manifestations&#148; amounts to the same thing as &#147;signs&#148;, which is the professional term used to describe evidence elicited by the clinician as a result of observing the patient? What I hope the amendment would not allow is preventive detention for reasons of social control or public order. It would do so only if &#147;manifestations&#148; could be interpreted as including offending behaviour. Detention in hospital to stop offending would therefore amount to treatment. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell me that the amendment could in no circumstances be interpreted in that way.</p>

I want to say &#147;thank you&#148; for the fact that the Bournewood case now appears to have been solved. We hope that it has been solved. We are particularly grateful for Amendment No. 79, which introduces a regulation-making power to reduce the maximum authorisation period for a Bournewood detention below one year, following the monitoring of the operation of the Bournewood provisions in practice; and for Amendments Nos. 80 to 99, which give Bournewood patients and their representatives the right to an independent mental capacity advocate and set out the circumstances in which this applies.

I am very pleased that there has been recognition of all the work that has been done since this House last considered the Bill. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said earlier, much has been done, individually and collectively, to improve it. As the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said, however, current provision for mental health patients has also been improved, which is important. I well understand the disappointment expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, about the timescale for age-appropriate treatment. Sadly, she did not mishear me; I did say that the provision would not operate fully&#151;I stress fully&#151;until about April 2010. We will implement it gradually, so I hope that ultimately she will not be too disappointed.</p>

<a name="70702-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0707025000264"></a>I hope that I can reassure the noble Earl, Lord Howe, that &#147;manifestations&#148; has no particular clinical meaning. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as,</p>
<ul><a name="0707025000378"></a>&#147;the demonstration, revelation, or display of the existence, presence, qualities, or nature of some person or thing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000353"></a>So although the two words could mean the same thing, &#147;signs&#148; has a more limited and specialist meaning, so using it would risk ambiguity in the way that the use of the word &#147;manifestations&#148; would not. I hope that that has reassured the noble Earl. Clearly it has not.</p>

If the meanings are not synonymous, that gives rise to the question: what else could &#147;manifestations&#148; mean?

Is that correct? Is he asking whether this is another attempt to detain people with untreatable personality disorders? I am clearly incorrect. I will have either to respond a little later or to write to him about the definition of &#147;signs&#148; as opposed to &#147;manifestations&#148;. A note has been passed to me&#151;magic. It says that &#147;manifestations&#148; is an ordinary English word that does not have the special meaning that doctors will give to &#147;signs&#148;. It will therefore be easier for everyone to understand in practice. It is merely a matter of people&#146;s understanding. There will be no difference between the word &#147;signs&#148; and &#147;manifestations&#148;. It is ultimately simply a matter of people being able to understand what it means. As the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, said earlier, it is very important for the Bill to contain words that everyone can understand. The word &#147;signs&#148; rather than &#147;manifestations&#148; will therefore be more easily understood by everyone involved.</p>

My concern, shared by many noble Lords, was that if someone was behaving in a certain manner in public&#151;let us say, aggressively&#151;they could be taken into preventive detention and that would amount to treatment under the Bill&#146;s terms. I hope that the Minister can allay that concern.</p>

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="0707025000268"></a><b><a name="70702-0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0707025000518"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, a little further clarification: symptoms and manifestations are intended to cover all the ways that the disorder affects the patient&#146;s functioning, in terms of how the patient thinks, feels or believes. While there is almost certainly some overlap between the two, broadly speaking we think that &#147;symptoms&#148; covers the consequences of which patients themselves complain while &#147;manifestations&#148; more obviously covers the evidence of the disorder as seen by other people. In the end, the important point is not the distinction between the two words but the certainty that between them they cover the whole gamut of what can be addressed by medical treatment. I acknowledge that the noble Earl and other noble Lords are concerned about the definition and I suggest that we should look at it in the code of practice, perhaps more clearly expressing the definition of those two words. If we were to do that and to consult noble Lords as we draw up the code of practice perhaps that would allay their fears.</p>

I thank the Minister for that offer, which I am sure noble Lords on this side of the House would wish to accept. The key point, however, is the one that we debated long and hard; that of therapeutic benefit. Treatment must contain some measure of therapeutic benefit if it is to count as medical treatment. Simple detention in a confined space would not amount to medical treatment. That is the concern that we hope the Government will meet.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_836"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 836</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0707025000273"></a>Commons Amendments Nos. 4, 31, 36, 37 and 40 reverse amendments made in the House that would have required a patient&#146;s responsible clinician to gain agreement from a doctor before renewing a patient&#146;s detention or initiating, extending or revoking a patient&#146;s community treatment order. To allow a responsible clinician&#146;s decisions to be overridden by a doctor who may not even be involved in the patient&#146;s care is certainly not the best thing for patients or for an efficient workforce. That is why the other place voted to overturn your Lordships&#146; amendments. However, the Government have always said that the decision to renew a patient&#146;s detention should involve the multidisciplinary team of professionals concerned with the patient&#146;s care. Before furnishing the renewal report the Act already requires a patient&#146;s responsible clinician to consult at least one other person on a multidisciplinary team.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0707025000274"></a>Amendment No. 4A, laid by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, seeks to require also that the responsible clinician secures the agreement of such a person who must be of a different profession from the responsible clinician. The provision would apply to all responsible clinicians of whatever professional background. We have considered this amendment carefully. On balance, we believe that it offers an excellent solution. It avoids the problems associated with your noble Lords&#146; previous amendments, which harked back to an outdated &#147;doctor knows best&#148; approach. The Mental Health Coalition, representing 85 per cent of the mental health workforce, says that the previous amendments would have introduced,</p>
<ul><a name="0707025000379"></a>&#147;outmoded hierarchies between the professions in decision-making situations [and] taken mental health care backwards&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707025000354"></a>They also would have undermined the New Ways of Working initiative, which has general support from psychiatrists and others. They would have stood in the way of efforts to ensure that professionals&#146; skills are recognised and focused where they are needed, to the benefit of patients and an efficient workforce.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0707025000275"></a>By contrast, the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, is compatible with a multidisciplinary assessment and has the renewal decision made by professionals who know the patient. It is for the responsible clinician to decide whether a patient&#146;s detention should be renewed, but it is not unreasonable to expect that they have formal support from at least one other member of the multidisciplinary team. Good practice already dictates that they should negotiate agreement with the team. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment recognises multidisciplinary working; it is one that we can support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="0707025000279"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we on these Benches appreciate the number of amendments that will be a real improvement to the original Bill and will, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, has said, be a serious improvement overall to mental health services, certainly by 2010. However, I cannot help but express my profound disappointment that the change in culture and attitudes of the Government and the professions towards people with mental health problems, which we hoped a new Bill would introduce, has not happened after eight years&#146; serious hard work.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="0707025000280"></a>I would be more depressed if it were not going to be easier for people who are depressed to be sectioned in future. It took from 1828 to 1845 for the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury to bring about the very significant changes in 1845. He had to battle away until 1880 to ensure that those changes were retained. Sometimes they were lost for a few years and then he had to fight again. In another 20 years, I hope that some of us will be back to introduce a Bill which seriously changes attitudes.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="0707025000281"></a>On Amendment No. 4A, the renewal of detention is as important for the patient as the initial detention, which we have not taken as seriously as we should have done in the past. This modest amendment would require two clinicians, both of whom have to be concerned with the treatment of the patient. I make no secret of the fact that I would prefer safeguards&#151;for example, in regard to the medical expertise that would be required in the renewal&#151;to be at least as strong as those required under the Mental Capacity Act. It is not a matter of hierarchies but of appropriate training and competences.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="0707025000282"></a>In accepting this amendment, what do the Government envisage will be in the regulations and the code of practice to ensure that the second clinician will see and examine the patient? At the moment there is nothing in the provision to determine that the patient will be seen and examined, which is pretty essential. Secondly, which of the professionals do the Government envisage will give the objective medical expertise on mental disorder, which has been determined by the European Court of Human Rights, to satisfy the criteria for detention under the Act? Which of the clinicians would that be? I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness has put the case very well. I believe the case is unanswerable. I am delighted that the Government have signalled their willingness to consider the amendment positively but, like the noble Baroness, I believe that there is a potential problem with the amendment because it does not explicitly require the second person to conduct an examination of the patient. I very much hope that no clinician would be satisfied that the conditions have been met other than by an examination. It would be wrong for this provision to allow the responsible clinician to get someone in the team just to rubber-stamp his or her view. The second opinion needs to be a separate independent decision, and I hope that the code of practice will reflect that.</p>

There have been a substantial number of positive changes. I also identify myself with the appreciation that he expressed of the work of Professor Zigmond, Dr Daw and many other colleagues who have devoted a great deal of time and effort to trying to assist us in improving the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="0707025000286"></a>I also have to identify myself with the rather downbeat remarks of my noble friend Lady Barker and my colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, because despite all the work that has been done I do not find this a good Bill. It does not address things in the way that it ought to. The whole process has suggested to me, rather than a move forward and an appreciation of the complexity of the problems that we are dealing with, a damping down, indeed a dumbing down, of those problems.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="0707025000287"></a>I speak at this point because of the concept of &#147;responsible clinician&#148;, which expresses some of the dilemma that we are in, as pointed to by the Minister in her reference to the changes as doing away with a paternalistic, &#147;doctor knows best&#148; attitude. Frankly that is part of the problem of not understanding the complexity. Mental illness cannot be dealt with simply at a sociological, psychological or biological level; it is a highly complex group of phenomena with which we are struggling to become familiar. I understand that parliamentarians, lawyers and others who do not immerse themselves in the business of understanding and dealing with these problems want a simple answer. It is always the same when as a professional one finds oneself in court: the lawyers want a yes or no answer and get frustrated when the truth is not a simple yes or no. Parliamentary colleagues, particularly those with constituency responsibilities, want a simple yes or no answer to whether a troublesome person can be locked away in one way or in another way. It is simply not like that, yet we find increasing pressures from the community and from colleagues in other professions to give those simple yes and no answers to get rid of troublesome and difficult problems and indeed people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="0707025000288"></a>Despite the improvements in the Bill, all the work and energy that have gone into it, and the extensive process that we have gone through, it is with a rather heavy heart that I see it go forward, because it represents a lessening of our understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the issues with which we are dealing, and a slipping back into a rigid, simplistic way of viewing things. That is certainly easier to communicate in terms of a slogan, a remark or what may be passed in a court of law, but the complexities of mental disorder in particular are not susceptible to that kind of understanding. Many will suffer more because of this approach.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="0707025000289"></a>It is not just a question of the victims being adversely affected, physically or otherwise. The first victims of mental illness are those who suffer from it, but the second group of victims comprises their partners, family and friends, and those with whom they live. The third largest group, in terms of the number of people involved, comprises the healthcare workers who have to work with the victim and frequently find themselves grossly affected by what is happening. The last and much smaller group are those in the rest of society who, on unusual occasions, come across the problem. But frankly, that happens less often with those who are mentally ill than with those who are not. I see a lessening of the understanding of the distinction between frank mental illness, as a falling away from normal function, as against personality disorder, a disturbance of a different kind.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="0707025000290"></a>I am worried that more will be admitted to and kept in hospitals on a formal basis, and that, because of that, many others who are not admitted on a formal basis will find that there is no bed for them. There will be no possibility of them being attended to because, unless substantially greater resources are invested, what resources there are will be devoted to those who are creating difficulties and causing trouble rather than those able to be treated successfully.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="0707025000291"></a>I welcome all the positive things about the management of young people in more age-appropriate circumstances, advocacy and some of the other changes that have taken place. But, as I have said, it is with a heavy heart that I see this Bill pass, as it may be a considerable time before we can return to repair the attitudes that we see represented in the Bill&#146;s provisions.</p>

But I take a different view. It is not that I think this is perfect legislation, but it links in with the two previous Acts and enhances them. I also take the view that other clinicians, not necessarily medical clinicians, may be better placed to take some of the decisions about admitting people because they work with the individuals.

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="0707025000293"></a>I recognise that this issue is extraordinarily complex and that medication is an important part of it. Medics issue prescriptions, but there are plenty of clinicians who are not doctors but who can administer medications on behalf of doctors. There are other ways of moving forward. I hope that we will do so, but I say that with some humility in the face of the two noble Lords who have just spoken.</p>

As she said, changing attitudes takes a huge amount of time, but I am sure that in the end we shall arrive at a situation with which we are all content and where we have achieved all we want to for patients with mental health problems. I note the continuing concerns and heavy hearts of noble Lords. The Government understand that this is a highly complex area with a lot of grey; it is not a question of black or white, yes or no. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that there are different victims as he broadly defines them.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="0707025000295"></a>Our policy is to allow the patient&#146;s case to be led by the most appropriate professional to address their main treatment needs. In the majority of cases, a psychiatrist will be the most appropriate professional, but it will not always be so. For example, if the patient requires, exclusively or primarily, psychological interventions, inflexible and outdated legislation, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said, must not stand in the way of the most appropriate person doing the job. One professional cannot address all of a patient&#146;s needs; that is why there must be a multi-disciplinary team.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="0707025000296"></a>If the patient is receiving medication but their main treatment needs demand a responsible clinician who is not qualified to prescribe, the medication will be the responsibility of a professional who can prescribe. I stress that the Bill does not require any professional to act beyond their competence. A responsible clinician who is not qualified to prescribe cannot decide to perpetuate medication decisions. Medication should be kept under review by an appropriately qualified professional, separate from the decision to renew compulsory powers. A patient whose case is being considered for renewal will have their medication authorised by a second opinion appointed doctor.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="0707025000297"></a>No responsible clinician will be expected to act beyond their expertise, and statutory competency requirements will ensure that all responsible clinicians, of whatever professional background, will have the expertise to carry out their functions under the Act. This includes providing objective medical expertise about the patient&#146;s need for detention. We have worked closely with stakeholders, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the BMA, on drafting the competency requirements for responsible clinicians. Advice from the Queen&#146;s Counsel, sought

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="0707025000298"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, asked which professions will be able to take on the responsible clinician role. The professions that can become approved clinicians and therefore take on this role will be set out in directions from the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers. Only suitably regulated professions will be selected. In both England and Wales they will include chartered psychologists, mental health and learning disability nurses, occupational therapists and social workers, in addition to doctors. Individuals wishing to become approved clinicians will need to demonstrate that they have the right experience, skills and competencies to take on that role. Draft directions for England, which include the professions that can be approved, are in the Library and on the Department of Health website.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="0707025000299"></a>The noble Baroness quite rightly asked what will be in the regulations to require the second professional to examine a patient. The primary legislation will require the second professional to be professionally concerned with the patient; they will know the patient&#146;s case. The draft regulations will, of course, be made available, and we would welcome the input of all noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="0707025000306"></a>We come to the final part of our discussions: the introduction of supervised community treatment. I do not exaggerate when I say that both here and in the other place supervised community treatment has been a source of considerable debate. Without having a Second Reading debate on the principles, I emphasise that supervised community treatment is intended to  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_842"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 842</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provide a way to minimise restrictions on people&#146;s lives, allowing some patients to spend less time in hospital and giving them more freedom rather than less.</p>

<a name="70702-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="0707025000307"></a>I understand the controversy that supervised community treatment has attracted and we have listened hard to the concerns and questions raised in debates. The amendments brought forward today were laid in the other place and, together with further amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, which the Government will accept, we have come to a satisfactory conclusion, which will ensure that we have a system that is workable for professionals, is beneficial to patients and strikes the right balance between patients&#146; rights and prevention of harm.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="0707025000308"></a>Commons Amendment No. 33 removes from the Bill the examples of conditions that could be attached to a community treatment order. We have been responsive to the many strongly expressed concerns about the conditions. Although we have always been clear that the conditions could not be used to exert undue control over a patient&#146;s freedom, we know that the term &#147;psychiatric ASBO&#148; has passed into common parlance. This has caused unnecessary alarm to patients and their families and has to be dealt with. That is why the amendment makes it clear on the face of the Bill that the conditions must be about ensuring that the patient receives treatment or about preventing harm to the patient or others. With one exception, which is a technicality, the Bill makes it clear that conditions cannot be imposed for any other purpose.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="0707025000309"></a>We have recognised, too, that despite the many safeguards for patients on supervised community treatment&#151;the same rigorous process and timing of review as for detained patients, the right to apply to a tribunal and the hospital managers for discharge, automatic referral and the nearest relative&#146;s right to discharge&#151;some people were concerned that it would be hard for patients to get off supervised community treatment. We decided that, in addition to those safeguards, it was right to accept a further provision, originating in this House, that a AMHP should have to agree to the extension of a CTO each and every time it comes up for review. Our Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 42 cast that provision in a slightly different way from the original but have exactly the same effect. We must get the provisions and safeguards for supervised community treatment right so that best practice can flow from the right base. I hope that your Lordships will agree that the amendments address some of the key concerns that have been expressed.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="0707025000310"></a>I emphasise that supervised community treatment will be suitable only for a limited number of patients; it cannot realistically prevent all suicides and homicides by people with a mental disorder. But supervised community treatment allows a system to be put in place that makes prevention more likely than it would be without it. It is a fact that a significant proportion of homicides and suicides follow patients&#146; non-compliance with their medication. If we can tackle non-compliance with treatment through supervised community treatment to keep patients well, that is an end in itself. There is also a real chance that, as a consequence, supervised

I am certain that it will improve patients&#146; lives while at the same time improving patient and public safety.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="0707025000311"></a>I turn now to the criteria for eligibility for supervised community treatment, which has been the subject of much debate and concern. Your Lordships removed the Bill&#146;s original criteria due to fears that they were too broad and would allow too many patients to qualify. In their place, your Lordships put criteria that would have restricted eligibility to very few patients indeed. I understand the concern that noble Lords expressed. I also understand that your Lordships considered that aftercare under supervision would be available only for those at risk of harming themselves. Noble Lords will recall our debate and the concern that I expressed that running two schemes in parallel would not work. Those original amendments required two compulsory admissions before supervised community treatment would become available.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="0707025000312"></a>I always understood the rationale for those amendments, but we could not accept them as they stood because they would immediately risk excluding patients who might benefit. Those patients would either have to remain in hospital or be discharged without any form of supervised treatment in the community. We felt that that would put families, carers and clinicians in an impossible position. It would mean that they would have to wait until the patient relapsed before supervised community treatment could become an option. For some patients that could be too late, because the relapse might be fatal, and for all patients the prognosis is worse the longer they wait to get the treatment that they need. Therefore, we felt that such a criterion was arbitrary and would fetter clinical judgment.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="0707025000313"></a>Therefore, the Government made amendments in the other place, which were accepted, to reinstate the criteria in the original Bill. Before doing so, we reviewed those criteria very carefully. We considered whether the criticism of those criteria made by your Lordships was justified. We concluded that the criteria did the job that they were intended to do and that they were set at the right level.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="0707025000314"></a>However, we accept that those criteria have given rise to concerns that supervised community treatment could be used too readily and that it could be used as a failsafe option without true justification. We do not agree with that, but we understand that we have to allay those concerns. That is why we support the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, as they put beyond doubt what supervised community treatment is all about. In so doing, I pay tribute to the noble Lord. I am most grateful to noble Lords who have taken part in these extensive discussions. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="0707025000317"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, before I speak to my amendments, I, too, thank the Minister for his informative and supportive manner and his continued patience with those of us who are relatively new to the House and are trying to find our way through the complexities of health and social care legislation.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="0707025000318"></a>When the Government announced their intention to introduce community treatment orders, they offered the reassurance that these were designed specifically to apply to so-called &#147;revolving-door&#148; patients, who, as many noble Lords are aware, constitute a relatively small number of those people who are detained under the Mental Health Act. I remind your Lordships that part of the Government&#146;s rationale for introducing a CTO power was that it could provide a less restrictive alternative to long stays, or repeated stays, in hospital for such patients. I think that it is true to say that a great many of the experts from whom we have heard over the years, whether professionals or patients, have found the idea of a CTO acceptable only on these terms: that is, if its use is confined to the revolving-door patients&#151;those who have had multiple admissions to in-patient care.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="0707025000319"></a>If Parliament drafts the law too widely, the danger is that CTOs will be applied too widely. They could even become part of the normal discharge process for detained patients generally, as a kind of safety net for risk-averse mental health service staff and managers. If this happens, Parliament will not have produced a measure that enables a less restrictive alternative for the effective management of this small group of patients, but instead will have increased massively the legal coercion of psychiatric patients generally. I do not believe that this is the intention of Parliament and I hope that the Minister can reassure me today that my belief is correct. I again take this opportunity to point out the very understandable fear in some black and minority ethnic communities that any increase in coercive powers will impact disproportionately on them.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="0707025000320"></a>It was with a view to defining the scope of CTOs more precisely that this House tightened the criteria for their use in its previous debates, but of course these amendments to the Bill were undone in another place. I understand that the Government are particularly concerned not to allow any threshold for using CTOs that arbitrarily excludes patients. I understand that concern, which we all share, but there are still some differences between us on what an  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_845"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 845</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arbitrary threshold would be. I doubt that I am the only one in this House who felt deep concern at the phrase used by some government officials and Ministers that every exclusion is a patient not treated. </p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="0707025000321"></a>As chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission, I find it particularly disturbing to see the conflation of treatment opportunity and coercive treatment in this way. It is important that we establish a threshold below which treatment is offered rather than insisted on. It should be a salutary lesson to us all that, even in parliamentary debates and ministerial statements outside the House, the focus on revolving-door patients as the proper subjects of CTOs appears to have blurred. If the lawmakers cannot keep such a focus, it is a vain hope that the people who operate the law will do so.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="0707025000322"></a>With that in mind, I will pay close attention to the consultation on the code of practice, and I hope that the code will end up with a clear statement of intent regarding CTOs. That is not as good as the proper legal threshold that I and many others in this House and elsewhere would like to see, but it seems that this is the best that we are likely to get.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="0707025000323"></a>Therefore, my amendment is a modest proposal designed to ensure that professionals pay some regard to the clinical history of a patient for whom they are considering a CTO. It does not have the effect of establishing a threshold for CTO that certain things must have occurred in the patient&#146;s treatment history, such as disengagement with services leading to relapse, but it will stand as a reminder to clinicians that they should be basing their decisions about a person&#146;s liberties on evidence and not on supposition. It is not as far as I would like to go in defining the law, but it improves the government amendment, and I hope that the Minister will be able to accept it. I beg to move.</p>

Of course we hope that CTOs will do good and that they will be seen as having a place for certain groups of patients, but there are still real uncertainties about their implementation. </p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="0707025000327"></a>I have two questions for the Minister on CTOs. The first concerns the length of time that a CTO should continue before being brought to an end. We debated that at earlier stages without result. The Minister may say that this is a matter for clinicians and not for Parliament, but at what point does a CTO achieve its purpose? At what point does a clinician know that it is safe to remove the conditions of compulsion under which the patient is living? As Genevra Richardson pointed out, that judgment would be extremely difficult to make, and clinicians may prefer not to make it but instead to play safe by simply letting the CTO run on. We are back to the analogy of the lobster pot. What, if anything, will be included in the code of practice to prevent a CTO from running on indefinitely year after year? How reasonable and ethical is it and how justifiable by reference to the evidence from other jurisdictions is it for a patient to remain on a CTO for years at a time? If the Bill allows this, as it appears to do, I, for one, am not at all comfortable about it, and the amendments passed in another place unfortunately do not meet that concern.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="0707025000328"></a>My second question relates to the conditions that a clinician may specify in a CTO. It is very welcome that the circumstances in which such conditions may be applied are now more tightly drawn than they were previously, but what if the patient subjected to a CTO thinks that the conditions are unreasonable? When we debated this at earlier stages, the Government did not see that as a problem, but what legal remedy does a person subjected to a CTO have if he thinks that the conditions supposedly placed on him for his own good are an unreasonable infringement of personal liberty? Is it right or just that there is no appeal mechanism for this aspect of his regime?</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="0707025000329"></a>I ask these questions partly as a result of a letter that I received in the past few days from an eminent professor of psychiatry, whom I shall not name. He refers in his letter to the confusion about what CTOs are actually for. The purpose of a CTO, he says, is to get non-compliant patients back on medication and to make sure that they stay there&#151;no more, no less. That, according to the professor, is an end in itself; anything that may follow from it is secondary. I was shocked by that opinion. It may seem extraordinary that at this late stage of our deliberations on the Bill we should debate a fundamental issue of this kind, but I would be glad if the Minister took this opportunity to comment on it. Until now, I had thought that the point of a CTO was to make a patient well again. If the point is no more than to get him to take his medication, we are saying that medication should be forced on a patient even if it is doing him no good and even if it may lead to harm. Such an attitude in the highest ranks of the medical profession shows, I have to say, why patients need protection from certain doctors and why some of us have been arguing strongly for safeguards in the Bill, such as therapeutic benefit.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="0707025000330"></a>Will the Minister undertake to ensure that the code of practice is quite clear about the ultimate purpose of a CTO? In the light of the attitude reflected in the letter to which I referred, does he not agree that the view recently expressed by the Royal College of Nursing that compulsory medication should not be used as a substitute for adequate mental healthcare is absolutely to the point? To return to the questions that I asked earlier, if a doctor&#146;s sole purpose in using a CTO is, heaven forbid, nothing more than to get a patient to keep on taking his medication, when is the end point reached in that process, how will a doctor know and at what point along the road do the conditions attached to the CTO become inherently oppressive and unfair?</p>

Let me respond to a number of points raised by noble Lords. I come first to the question of evidence. Of course there has been considerable discussion about the evidence that underpins the proposals. We have had a debate about the evidence commissioned by my department&#151;or my previous department&#151;and, as ever with these matters, noble Lords have brought their interpretation to that evidence. Clearly, one has to say that there is a lack of what might be called gold-standard evidence available anywhere in the world. We must rely on the evidence that is available and we sometimes have to accept its limitations.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07070226000004"></a>There is no doubt that around the world there is evidence to show the potential of supervised community treatment to prevent harm. Indeed, closer to home, Scotland has been mentioned in this House on a number of occasions, although noble Lords have for some reason been rather quiet about it in relation to supervised community treatment. But there we have it&#151;in Scotland, you do not have to be detained before you are eligible for the benefits of supervised community treatment. Circumstances sometimes make comparisons rather difficult, but throughout the world it is clear that community treatment orders of one kind or another are increasingly accepted. I remind noble Lords that we propose supervised community treatment only after immediate prior detention in hospital for treatment. So we are proposing a system with narrow eligibility, which is found in the majority of jurisdictions that use such orders. In answer to some of the other points raised, I do not think that this has always been recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07070226000005"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked about the factors that a clinician must consider when making an initial decision about the patient&#146;s eligibility for supervised community treatment. As part of this process, the clinician must decide whether he needs to be able to recall a patient to hospital. For this purpose, the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Patel, allows a clinician to take into account factors that are relevant to that decision, including the patient&#146;s history. It is important that a clinician can consider all relevant factors, an obvious example being the patient&#146;s current medical state. Other relevant factors might include the degree of  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_848"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 848</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recovery of symptoms, any suicidal ideas or feelings of hopelessness, which will be important predictors of likely risk. In addition, a patient&#146;s insight and attitude to their treatment, and the protective circumstances into which a patient would be discharged, might be relevant. These are all factors that may not be evident in the patient&#146;s history.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07070226000006"></a>The amendment has the effect that the responsible clinician must consider the risk of the patient&#146;s condition deteriorating in the community when deciding whether it is necessary for him to be able to exercise the power to recall the patient to hospital. This means that, in order to place a patient on supervised community treatment, the responsible clinician will need to be able to show that he has properly considered and, if appropriate, assessed the risk of deterioration&#151;otherwise, his decision could be open to challenge in the courts. I hope that that clarifies the position for the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07070226000007"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, also asked whether a patient should be able to challenge the conditions of community treatment orders. We discussed this before. My right honourable friend Mrs Winterton, the then Health Minister, said in Committee in the Commons that for supervised community treatment to work a patient must accept and be ready to co-operate with the conditions of a CTO. There would simply be no point in setting a condition with which a patient would not comply, because nothing hangs on a failure to comply. I very much take his point about the code of practice. The code of practice will ensure that patients and those close to them will be involved in agreeing the conditions. On account of that, a third-party appeals process would not be appropriate.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07070226000008"></a>In response to the other question that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised, I accept that if a patient goes on to supervised community treatment, and it is no longer necessary for that treatment to apply, the last thing that we would want is for that patient to have to remain on supervised community treatment. I understand his point about what I guess he would call defensive medicine by the clinician. We will have to address that through the code and clinical professional practice. I assure him that we will do so. However, given the clinician&#146;s responsibility to themselves, to the patient and in law, they must apply the provisions as laid down in this Act. The Act ensures that, where a patient no longer needs to be subject to supervised community treatment, that patient should no longer be so.</p>

<a name="70702-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07070226000009"></a>A lot of our debate has been about the context of practice within the law. I accept that one of the concerns in this whole mental health debate has been about clinical practice. As we now move forward with a Bill that will, we hope, shortly be an Act, I emphasise again to noble Lords that whatever the disagreements there have been&#151;and there have been many&#151;we have worked hard to try to meet the major concerns. I know that we have not met all those concerns and that some noble Lords passionately argue for further changes. However, I think that we have reached a position where, with the code and with the regulations, we can determine and do everything we can to ensure that the practitioners out there

Above all, this legislation will prove to be a foundation on which to take forward the provision and development of services in the interest of both the public and the patient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07070226000010"></a>As these are my departing words as a Health Minister, let me say that it has been a great privilege to have served in this position.

The Statement is as follows.</p>
 &#147;First and foremost, I am sure that all Members will agree that our top priority is the success of the investigation and any subsequent prosecution. For this reason, I will not be drawn on speculation concerning details of what is still a fast-moving investigation.&#147;The facts as they have been reported to me by the police and other agencies are as follows. At one am on 29 June an ambulance crew reported a suspicious Mercedes vehicle outside a nightclub in the Haymarket in central London.  The vehicle contained significant amounts of petrol, gas cylinders and nails.  Explosives officers from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command were called and manually disabled the means of detonation.&#147;During the course of their investigation on Friday, the police learned of a second Mercedes vehicle that was issued with a parking ticket about 2.30 am on 29 June.  The car was parked in Cockspur Street, London, close to the location of the first vehicle.  The second vehicle was taken to a pound in Hyde Park at about 3.30 am that  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_851"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 851</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>morning.  The vehicle contained similar materials to those found in the first, including a significant amount of fuel, gas canisters and a quantity of nails.  As with the first device, the vehicle was quickly made safe by explosives officers.  The police quickly confirmed that the vehicles were linked. Further examination will reveal additional detail about the impact that these devices may have had if detonated, but at this stage the police believe that these were potentially viable devices that could have caused significant injury or loss of life.  &#147;At 15:15 on 30 June, a Jeep Cherokee drove into a front door at the check-in area of the terminal building at Glasgow Airport and caught fire on impact.  One member of the public sustained minor injuries in the immediate aftermath of this incident.  The police have confirmed that the incident at the airport was linked to the vehicles discovered in London.  &#147;The investigations into these incidents have involved police forces across the United Kingdom.  To date, six individuals have been arrested in connection with the events: one at Glasgow Airport, a further two in Glasgow, two in Staffordshire&#151;north of junction 16 on the M6&#151;and one in Liverpool. One further individual of interest remains in a critical condition in hospital. Searches have already been carried out in at least 19 locations but, as I have already said, this is a fast-moving investigation. &#147;I am sure that the House will join me in thanking all those involved in the response to these incidents: the ambulance crew whose vigilance potentially averted an attack; the police, particularly the explosives officers who manually disabled the device in the Haymarket; and the Security Service. In addition, the response from the public and business community&#151;including staff at airports&#151;has been excellent in support of the police and other emergency services. &#147;I would also like to thank colleagues in Scotland and internationally in the United States and in Europe for their support. Since Friday morning, the Government have held four meetings of COBRA, chaired by the Prime Minister and myself and attended by ministerial colleagues from key government departments and the police and intelligence agencies. Our priority has been to co-ordinate the necessary responses to protect the public.&#147;I turn now to the response that is under way across the country. The police have substantially stepped up protective security measures including: high-visibility patrols, including armed response vehicles; increased use of stop-and-search powers for vehicles and pedestrians; and increased physical protection around airport terminal buildings, including tighter controls on access roads and installation of new barriers, in conjunction with airport operators and the Department for Transport. &#147;As ever, these measures are designed to maximise public safety while minimising disruption to normal life. This supplements the

Police counterterrorism security advisers have already advised a range of crowded places in recent months, including over 450 major sporting venues and around 400 shopping centres. &#147;As the House will be aware, the UK national threat level was raised from &#145;severe&#146; to &#145;critical&#146; on Saturday 30 June by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. JTAC sets threat levels based on a comprehensive analysis of all intelligence relating to international terrorism.&#147;Terrorism is a serious threat to us all. We must ensure that our resources, capability and legislation support our common endeavour to defend the shared values of this country from terror. To that end we have doubled expenditure on counterterrorism since September 2001. Work as part of the current Comprehensive Spending Review will further assess the expenditure necessary. We have started a full consultative review of counterterrorism legislation with a view to a Bill later this year. This process will continue. We have refocused the Home Office, developed the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism and have established a weekly security board, chaired by the Home Secretary, to co-ordinate the efforts of key departments and agencies. Across government, Ministers will work together to oversee the delivery of this complex package of measures.&#147;Let us be clear: terrorists are criminals, whose victims come from all walks of life, communities and religions. Terrorists attack the values that are shared by all law-abiding citizens. As a Government, as communities and as individuals we need to ensure that the message of the terrorists is rejected. &#147;I very much welcome the strong messages of condemnation that we have heard throughout the weekend from community leaders across the country. It is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated. &#147;Mr Speaker, in closing my Statement I would also like to express my admiration and thanks to all members of the public in this country, in all our communities, for their patience and measured response to these events. My aim as Home Secretary is to allow the British public to live their lives as they would wish, within the law. The fact that people have been prepared to go about their lives as normally as possible this weekend sends the strongest message to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror&#148;.

For completeness&#151;for courtesy to this House&#151;I will repeat those questions. On 22 April, a newspaper carried a report produced by the Government&#146;s Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre that predicted a high risk of an attack at the handover from the last Prime Minister to the current one. Despite that, the threat level was not raised above &#147;severe&#148;, which is the level it stands at most of the time. We simply ask: why was that? Also, what were the implications for the police forces and security agencies of this lower level? Once alerted to the threat it is clear that the agencies responded remarkably quickly.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07070226000028"></a>We appreciate that the Home Secretary will have a very difficult task ahead because, although numerous threats have been foiled, we now have to face the fact that three attempted atrocities have occurred without warning.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07070226000029"></a>We recognise that the Government may well have to consider a significant increase in the size of the single intelligence budget and associated police budgets in the current Comprehensive Spending Review. Whatever their decision, it will have the Official Opposition&#146;s clear support.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07070226000030"></a>I welcome the statement made by the Prime Minister earlier today that he will not rush into creating new legislation, and the commitment by the Home Secretary, which I heard clearly on the radio, to consult other political parties and wider community representatives to decide on new laws and on other ways of countering the terrorist threat.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07070226000031"></a>It is important that we all maintain an open mind during the search for a constructive way forward, one not only that will appear to bring a solution, but that is evidence-based, not flawed and will deliver a secure future for all the people of our country. British people of all religions and none will stand together in the face of this evil. Ultimately, tackling terrorism in Britain must be a combined effort with politicians, the police, the security services and the whole community working together. If, in the days ahead, we are able to carry that forward, our society and our country really will have come out of this ordeal a stronger place in which to live.</p>

Let me from these Benches offer our congratulations on her appointment as the Attorney-General in the new Administration. She is a loyal member of her Government and has been a formidable Home Office Minister, defending at times what is difficult to defend. But, in her new role, I am sure that she will offer independent advice. That is a sure sign that her best is still to come.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07070226000033"></a>It is right that we should congratulate the police, the security services, our emergency services and members of the public who averted carnage both in London and in Glasgow. I also thank Black Rod and staff at the House of Lords for ensuring that Parliament is adequately secured.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07070226000034"></a>The Home Secretary&#146;s response has been measured. There were no hard-line pronouncements, but a determination to ensure that terrorists will not be allowed to succeed in undermining our democratic values. There is, however, a serious issue of concern. Religious fundamentalism of any kind is incompatible with our democratic values. That said, let us not forget that a substantial number of our ethnic population are law-abiding and loyal. They have condemned the action of the terror gangs. Let there be no backlash, because we need their support if we are to defeat terrorists from within or without. For that reason stop-and-search powers based on intelligence are certainly welcome, but their indiscriminate use on a particular section of the community could be very counterproductive.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07070226000035"></a>I commend the Government for moderation in their response, their change in tone and the decision not to use these events as a political point-scoring exercise in search of political draconian measures.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07070226000036"></a>I have said before that there is no such thing as total security. Some attackers will make a break through the network of intelligence and policing. We may not have done enough to secure our critical national infrastructures. Will the Minister give us assurances on that?</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07070226000037"></a>The Statement comes when arrests have been made and police investigations are continuing. It would be counterproductive to further speculate on the matter. It is now more than important that the new Home Secretary convenes the cross-party talks which were promised a few weeks ago. It is vital that we make up our mind on intercept evidence and, above all, look for measures that will send a message that a determined Parliament and people of all race, religion and colour in the United Kingdom will not allow terrorism to succeed, nor allow our hard-fought civil liberties to be sacrificed.</p>

The people of this country have stood bravely together and will continue to do so. It gives me considerable pleasure to see that we in this House seek to emulate the unity that has been shown outside it.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07070226000040"></a>On the first point raised by the noble Baroness, of course we note what was said in the document referred to in the <I>Sunday Times</I> on 22 April. The noble Baroness will know that it is not our practice to comment on leaked information. What I can say is that the Government continually receive intelligence from a variety of sources. This intelligence is evaluated and of course judgments have to be made on what actions should properly be taken in response to it.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07070226000041"></a>The United Kingdom threat level was previously set at &#147;severe&#148;, which the House will know is used when the assessment is that an attack is highly likely. All efforts were made to make sure that we were properly ready for any eventuality. Noble Lords will know that that level was recommended to go to &#147;critical&#148; because of the events of the past few days. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre is responsible for making that assessment.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07070226000042"></a>On new legislation, noble Lords will remember that my right honourable friend the then Home Secretary made a commitment about how it would be dealt with, which my right honourable friend in another place reiterated today. We will continue to look for consensus. It is clear that that is the aspiration and desire of all Members of this House and, indeed, of the other place. There will be no precipitous rush regarding those issues. I can give that reassurance to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07070226000043"></a>I agree very much with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, about the law abiding and loyal members of our community. All law abiding citizens abhor acts of terror. I am delighted that we as a people stand united against the viciousness of the terror which is inflicted against all of us, irrespective of, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia said, race, colour, religion or ethnicity.</p>

I am sure she has realised that the events of the past few days show that there are no easy issues in the new position which she occupies. However, I know that she has the good will of the whole House in the task in front of her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07070226000045"></a>In the Statement my noble and learned friend referred to the undoubted bravery of the ambulance and explosives officers in Haymarket. It is right that we all acknowledge what they did and our debt to them. Will she join me in extending that appreciation to the fire officers, the police and the civilians who dealt with the terrifying incident at Glasgow Airport where people were put at risk? It is a mark of Glasgow&#146;s resilience that civilians were prepared to give the police a hand in those circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07070226000046"></a>This is not the first time that Scotland has been affected by terrorism. However, it is the first time that we have had a co-ordinated attack throughout the United Kingdom. My noble and learned friend will know that the Lord Advocate in Scotland has responsibility for the prosecution of offences and directing the police in the conduct of their investigations. Can she say something about the contacts that have been made with the Scottish Administration? Will she confirm that their existing political differences will not inhibit their proper co-operation and that full co-operation will take place between respective police forces and security agencies?</p>

I join him in commending the bravery of those who participated in those events&#151;both in London and Glasgow. It is important that we look at the way in which people came together in Glasgow. I endorse the bravery demonstrated by the civilian who ran towards danger as opposed to away from it in order to give assistance to those who needed it. I do not hesitate to commend, without reservation, those acts of extreme bravery.</p>

<a name="70702-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07070226000048"></a>There has been the closest contact between the Government and fellow law officers and police officers dealing with events in Scotland. I had the advantage of speaking at length with the Lord Advocate yesterday and we have spoken twice today. All officials, officers and the Lord Advocate&#146;s team in Scotland are working as closely with us as is possible. We are totally at one in our response.</p>

If they had been the constituents of a dirty bomb or a chemical or biological attack, it would have been crucial to discover the nature of that attack at the earliest possible moment. In spite of the most commendable reaction of all the emergency services, will the Government carry out a review of whether it was discovered at the earliest possible moment that the nature of these potential attacks did not constitute something much more sinister?</p>

I have noticed in the past few days that a lot of information comes out on CNN and Fox News, which does not come out on the British channels, that can have come to them only through leaks from authorities over there who have been told things&#151;I hope in confidence&#151;over here.

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07070228000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to tell the House how to construct a multi-million pound fraud. This has been made possible by a European Union-wide agreement concluded in 1992, known as the Edinburgh agreement. We, enforcement authorities and indeed fraudsters were all initially slow to grasp the full range of its possibilities but, in 1999-2000, this fraud cost the taxpayer somewhere between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2.4 billion. Between 2005-06 it rose to somewhere between &#163;3.5 billion and &#163;4.75 billion, an amount which would go a long way towards funding the budget for the 2012 Olympics.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07070228000004"></a>This has been a difficult subject on which to get a grip. The inquiry for this report started under my distinguished predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Radice, in July 2006. However, like Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, we have been chasing a moving target. The original purpose of the report was to look at ways where countries could co-operate more closely in sharing information, but that issue turned out to be only a small part of the problem.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07070228000005"></a>When I took over the chairmanship of Sub-Committee A, we considered setting up a shell company to see if we could indeed readily commit this fraud. In the end, wiser counsel prevailed, and we decided to rely on the guidance of our special adviser, Tony Jackson from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, to whom our grateful thanks are due; HMRC, which went well beyond the call of duty, appearing several times before the committee and providing us with useful papers; and witnesses, including many small UK firms that took the trouble to write to us. I must also thank my Clerk, Simon Blackburn, and Petros Fassoulas, the committee adviser, both of whom have been indefatigable in their efforts.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07070228000006"></a>In describing this fraud and how it is committed, I need to remind the House that a major feature of VAT is that companies and firms collect the tax&#151;currently at 17.5 per cent&#151;on behalf of the Government. Companies and firms to whom a VAT rebate is due have the legal right to claim that rebate from the Government irrespective of whether the first company or firm has actually remitted the VAT it has collected to the Government. It is the Government&#146;s problem to make sure that VAT collected on their behalf is gathered in to the Treasury coffers.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07070228000007"></a>Therein lies the opportunity for fraudsters and the problem for Government. Before 1992, where company A, resident in the UK, bought goods from a company in France or anywhere else outside the UK, company A had to pay VAT at the point those goods entered the country. Safe transmission of 17.5 per cent of the order value into the Treasury was ensured at that point. Company A, having received the goods  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_862"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 862</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the UK, would then sell them on to company B, which would be entitled to make a claim for VAT. With the money from the first transaction safe in its coffers, HMRC would pay company B&#146;s legitimate claims.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07070228000008"></a>Compare and contrast the situation after 1992 when EU countries agreed that, in the interests of fostering trade, VAT should not be payable when a company in one EU country bought goods from a company that was also in the EU. Company A, still resident in the UK, can now buy goods from a company in France without paying VAT. When said company A sells on to company B, A will charge VAT at 17.5 per cent and should then remit the money to HMRC since it is collecting the VAT on behalf of the Government. Company B remains entitled to claim back the VAT it has paid&#151;at which point, while company A still has the money it has collected as VAT and company B has a claim for that money, company A disappears, leaving the Government facing a claim from company B, with no money from company A with which to pay it. This is why it is sometimes called missing trader fraud.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07070228000009"></a>I am deliberately making this simpler than it is. It is important to understand that this fraud usually involves an elaborate chain of traders and often comes round in a circle between the same fraudulent traders several times, hence &#147;carousel fraud&#148;, which is the other name for the fraud. Some traders in the chain may not be involved in the fraud at all but be smaller traders who were offered goods at what seemed to them like a good price. There are many variations on the basic theme, but what they have in common is that they are designed with the objective of creating confusion and concealing the fraud from HMRC&#146;s view. What they also have in common is a trader who has collected large amounts of VAT on the Government&#146;s behalf and then vanished.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07070228000010"></a>They are very large amounts of VAT, rising to between &#163;3.5 billion and &#163;4.75 billion for 2005-06. The figures for 2006-07 are not yet available, so we must rely on HMRC&#146;s contention that it is being successful in combating this fraud to some degree, but at a very substantial cost in effort, manpower and painful consequences for smaller traders.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07070228000011"></a>This fraud is enabled by a systemic weakness in the Community cross-border trade. Witnesses told us that this problem of the system being vulnerable to fraud was well understood in 1992, but that it was perceived that there was no alternative if trade within the European Union was to develop as all hoped. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, my colleague on the committee who was there at the time leading the negotiations for the UK, will tell your Lordships more this evening about the considerations actuating the contracting parties 15 years ago, I hope.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07070228000012"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has not, of course, sat idle while these vast sums have been stolen, but they are operating under handicap. One party can import goods free of VAT and, before vanishing, can sell them on immediately to another party who can claim the full amount from HMRC. The situation is, as one witness said, like standing in front of a jeweller&#146;s window in which there is no glass, trying to prevent passers-by helping themselves.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_863"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 863</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70702-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07070228000013"></a>In these circumstances, HMRC has fought back by various means, principally by introducing a system of extended verification which subjects all claims for VAT to a process of examination and scrutiny to ensure that all the VAT due in respect of any transaction has been paid. It has also co-operated with the Metropolitan Police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and to date has brought two successful prosecutions against fraudsters, with others pending. HMRC is clear that it is dealing with professional criminal gangs that are also involved in other criminal activity, including money-laundering and smuggling, but have turned their attention to this fraud because of the substantial money involved.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07070228000014"></a>While HMRC has reduced the level of money lost to the Exchequer, it is taking the full attention of 1,550 HMRC employees, and has gone a long way to paralysing trade in the communities most affected. In evidence, we heard of companies that had been waiting 12 months for a VAT repayment, and of some that had been forced out of business by the effect on cash flow of being unable to access VAT repayments.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07070228000015"></a>HMRC also sought to promote more sharing of data and information between member states, but this is an elaborate process and the UK is to some extent handicapped by the requirements of the Data Protection Act from playing a full part, or persuading others to do so. In the EU, 27 law enforcement agencies need to be fully involved to make the system effective, and this is very difficult to achieve.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07070228000016"></a>We concluded, in the light of all this, that while the amounts being lost were being reduced, the effort being deployed was unsustainable in other than the very short term. However, at the time we took evidence, HMRC was in the process of negotiating a change in European Union rules which was finally achieved on 1 June this year. It hoped that this would prove a more permanent and less strenuous solution. This was to allow the United Kingdom to impose a &#147;reverse charge&#148; to tax on two classes of goods&#151;mobile phones and computer chips&#151;in which fraud and attempted fraud had been particularly rife. The reverse charge is not dissimilar to a sales tax. From 1 June, a company wishing to deal in mobile phones or computer chips cannot import VAT-free, but must charge itself VAT on the invoice so that HMRC collects the tax due as the goods enter the UK. Missing trader fraud involving these two commodities is no longer possible, and we were told that HMRC believed that the imminence of this change accounted in part for the sharp fall in fraud involving mobile phones or computer chips earlier in the year.</p>

<a name="70702-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07070228000017"></a>The United Kingdom secured the derogation that enables HMRC to impose a reverse charge for only two years. More seriously, witnesses told us that the fraud, being as profitable and as straightforward as it is, will migrate to other goods and, worryingly, services both in the UK, which was of course the primary focus of this report, and in other European countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07070228000018"></a>The inescapable conclusion was that extended verification was an effective if blunt instrument that could not be deployed at its present intensity other than in the short term, and that the imposition of a  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_864"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 864</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reverse charge on mobile phones and computer chips was also only a short-term measure that would last as long as it took fraudsters to shift their operations to other goods and services. We therefore turned our attention to looking for a longer term solution. It seemed to us that we needed to shore up the weaknesses in the current VAT system. VAT is a useful and robust tax that is deployed by almost all developed countries, with the exception of the United States, and there is no good case for recommending a change to another sort of tax. Modifying the reverse charge system and practising it selectively in the UK could easily lead to a reverse charge being levied on several different goods&#151;or even on all goods and services, as Austria currently proposes. The member states of the European Union would then have in effect a sales tax. This tax is markedly less robust than VAT because, unlike VAT, it all has to be collected on the final transaction rather than at different points in the chain, which renders VAT as we know it both fairer and easier to collect. Moving to a sales tax would be a retrograde step, and we would not recommend it.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07070228000019"></a>In essence, we recommended that the UK should seek to lead the debate on a new system for cross-border VAT payments, and we suggested some options. Work is of course being done in the Commission, and the UK is not the only member state suffering serious losses to fraud as a result of the current system, but we want the Treasury and Customs to do some new thinking and to publish a review of the options, including the ones that we have identified. Specifically, we concluded that the most promising options involved some form of an origin system. Under such a system, VAT would be charged at the rate of the exporting country, and the purchaser would be able to claim a refund of the VAT paid in his own country. Our old friend, company A, would order goods from a supplier in Luxembourg, but would have to pay VAT at 15 per cent because that is the rate charged in Luxembourg. Company A could then charge company B VAT at 17.5 per cent as he sold the goods on. HMRC would have to collect the VAT from the Luxembourg Treasury, which would require the creation of a clearing house to facilitate VAT transfers between revenue authorities.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07070228000020"></a>It may not surprise your Lordships to know that Treasury witnesses did not favour a change to an origin system, adducing the concern that there could be difficulties in ensuring that member states received the tax that they were due through the clearing house. They told us that around &#163;40 billion of VAT was associated with goods traded between the UK and the other member states, and said that they believed that the system would carry considerable risk. We found this a little difficult to accept, given that substantially larger sums are allocated without incident or problem by clearing and settlement systems associated with securities trading. The Treasury also suggested, uncharitably in our view, that revenue authorities in other member states would not be motivated to collect tax revenue that they would pass to another member state.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07070228000021"></a>We concluded that the most promising change might be to a variant called the flat-rate origin system, which would involve all cross-border  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_865"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 865</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transactions carrying a 15 per cent flat-rate tax, wherever they originated, with a clearing house used to make sure that tax was received in the country of consumption. There are objections to this system, but it has the merit of being simple for both importers and exporters. It would involve setting up a clearing house, but this is no longer rocket science; the technology is now well understood and very efficient. Above all, it would not involve, as the present system does, a standing invitation to professional criminals to help themselves. I beg to move.</p>

First, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, the chairman of our sub-committee, who has presented very well the problems that have faced us. All of us on the sub-committee are grateful to her for her leadership.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07070228000024"></a>Although we have some quite elderly Peers in this House, no one is old enough to remember the South Sea bubble and the huge number of investors who lost their money in the 1700s, although they may have read about it. We have, however, had several confidence tricksters in the more recent past. One whom I remember well was Emil Savundra, who had an insurance company called Fire, Auto and Marine, which was designed and set up to be fraudulent. Then there was Bernie Cornfield, who ran a fraud called the Dover plan and wrote a book called <I>Do You Sincerely Want to be Rich?</I>. We had a major fraud that was based principally in London and surrounded BCCI, a bank engaged in money-laundering. Even more recently, huge fraud was perpetrated by Enron, the American giant, which resulted in considerable changes to corporate governance, and continuous boiler-room share transactions have preyed on old people and greedy people hoping to make a profit from worthless shares.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07070228000025"></a>All these frauds defrauded greedy and naive people and created a great deal of scandal in a comparatively short time. Edmund Burke said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="07070228000035"></a>&#147;Among a people generally corrupt, liberty cannot long exist&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070228000034"></a>So it should be. Missing trader fraud, commonly known as carousel fraud, is none of those things. It does not directly defraud individuals, but it directly defrauds nation states. It has spread its tentacles throughout government, and hardly any country has not been affected by it. The sub-committee, of which I am a member, has carried out an inquiry and, along with several colleagues of mine, we have come to certain undeniable conclusions. Those of you who have not read the report should do so, as carousel fraud is certainly the most sophisticated and widespread fraud ever perpetrated on a number of countries. Our own country, Britain, admits to the loss of about &#163;19 billion in the past eight years. The  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_866"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 866</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sub-committee reckons that a lot more has actually been lost, but no one can know for certain. France has not admitted the exact amount that it has lost, but certain reliable sources have said that it has lost the equivalent of &#8364;12 billion in the past year alone.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07070228000026"></a>Italy, Germany and Spain all have large economies and are all being severely hit by this fraud. The larger the country, the more it loses. The only countries that are partially escaping this fraud are very small and have a GNP that is low enough for them to be able to deal promptly with any attempt at fraud. The Scandinavian countries&#151;Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden&#151;have been fortunate in escaping the worst effects of this fraud, but countries such as Belgium, Holland and Portugal have all been substantially affected. We in the sub-committee believe that, because the fraud is so widespread and the amounts of money involved are so great, no Government will admit to the exact figures that their Exchequer is losing, and that when they strike out to try to stop the fraud, they succeed only in diverting it. </p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07070228000027"></a>Let me explain. Because of the large number of VAT frauds&#151;this fraud is all about VAT&#151;our Government decided that they would withhold VAT refunds to almost every mobile phone company. Mobile phones were and still are the principal product used to embezzle the Government, so our Government decided to withhold all payments to any trader in mobile phones. Several genuine companies and honest sole traders have gone bankrupt because the Government would not repay them their VAT. However, we must understand that the Government wanted to bring this fraud to an end and thought that stopping VAT refunds would have the desired effect. In some cases no payments have been made for over a year, and the Government hoped that this would halt the problem. It does no such thing.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07070228000028"></a>The Government have also introduced a reverse charge, which your Lordships will read about in our report as being one of the methods we have suggested to stop the fraud. I will come to the argument later that in the case that I put forward there is only one true way to stop the fraud, but in the mean time I will continue with what I reckon has resulted in the diversion of the fraud. Already crooked traders are starting to deal with other products. They are dealing in cosmetics, white goods and clothing. All those are smallish products but of a high value, very much in the same way as mobile phones. This was why mobile phones were the first chosen instrument to defeat the VAT regulations. There is no doubt that the Government&#151;and every Government&#151;want to try to stop fraud, and I commend them for trying. They have taken on an extra 1,500 staff to deal with the problem, which is costing the Exchequer billions every year. How much better would it be if those moneys were being spent on schools, hospitals and similar things which would improve the quality of life in Britain? Maybe it would even reduce the rate of tax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07070228000029"></a>Many of your Lordships will remember the fraud that occurred concerning the dollar premium. For those of your Lordships not conversant with this fraud, it was an actual fraud on the Government.  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_867"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 867</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>People dealt in the dollar premium, for which one got a 28 per cent rebate, and one rather prominent businessman left Britain never to return. That was a fraud on the Government which was much more confined in size and scope than missing trader fraud. Your Lordships may wonder what proposals I have for trying to contain and solve the problem. I have always been keen on a procedure which we used to call, in business, rattling the cage. What this means is that when and where one knows that a fraud is being committed, but one is not actually sure how it is being done or about the mechanics of it, one should send in a team that will investigate the fraud from every conceivable angle.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07070228000030"></a>I know that the Government have employed a huge number of extra people to deal with this fraud, but I think, with respect, that many of these are clerks checking VAT returns. I advocate&#151;very loudly&#151;that the police or the Serious Fraud Office, or both, raid premises at Heathrow Airport, where it is known that freight forwarders have been sending plane-loads of mobile phones abroad at least three times a week. It is not only Heathrow, but equally applies to freight forwarders all over Britain. As I said earlier, this fraud will migrate to other areas and, because the Government have been refusing repayments of VAT to mobile traders, this area of fraud may be coming to an end. But, in order for the fraud to migrate into other goods, all that will happen will be that the freight forwarders at Heathrow and throughout the country will deal in different goods. It is imperative that these are raided, papers are taken away and the trail of where these goods go is followed and dealt with in a proper and efficient manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07070228000031"></a>A bank in the Caribbean was closed as a result of questionable transactions. How many more banks are used to transfer huge amounts of money? Obviously the 1,500 extra staff employed are engaged in various areas of investigating this fraud, but one of the things that we have not been able to establish in our committee is how many of them are working at desks following paper trails, how many of them are in the field examining records in board rooms, offices and financial departments, and how many are involved in visiting banks to check the flow of funds inwards and outwards. These are questions that I would like answered. I would also like to know how many other banks have been investigated. Many banks throughout the world are of a somewhat shadowy nature and engage in money-laundering and doubtful transactions with doubtful companies. It would be helpful to know how many premises have been raided, how many prosecutions are pending at the moment, and how many individuals or companies are before the courts. That information will help present a picture of correct deployment of personnel.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07070228000032"></a>I go back to my suggestion of rattling the cage. Our committee knows through evidence that a number of freight forwarders have been engaged in transactions, some of which must be placed in the dubious category. How many freight forwarders have been raided, and how many of these have yielded information helpful to the apprehending of criminal gangs? It has been estimated that there are up to 100 highly organised criminal gangs spread across Europe engaged in missing trader

My strong recommendation to the Government is that they raid freight forwarders, follow the paper trails in offices, and investigate banks to see where the flow of money is coming from, and where it goes.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07070228000033"></a>I know that it is highly difficult to stop this fraud and that the Government are genuinely doing their best. I know that VAT rates are different throughout the EU and that it will be difficult to get the VAT rates agreed in all the different countries. Rattling the cage will catch a few criminals&#151;perhaps the less sophisticated ones&#151;but one has to hope that Governments will treat the matter extremely seriously, and that Governments throughout the EU will come together in an effort to get rid of this dreadful problem. I hope our Government will take whatever action they can as a matter of great urgency.</p>

<a name="07070233000002"></a><b><a name="70702-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07070233000062"></a>Lord Kerr of Kinlochard:</b> My Lords, as a member of Sub-Committee A, I join the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, in paying tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, for running our debates on the inquiry with a rod of iron. She is primarily responsible for the very high quality of the product. I commend the report to the House. As we worked on the inquiry we found that the subject was larger than we had first thought. Most of us concluded that, while we might have some doubts about the means of extended verification being used by HMRC to deal with the fraud we had no doubt about the necessity for strong action to deal with what was undoubtedly a substantial organised criminal attack, deliberately defrauding the Exchequer and hence honest taxpayers through manipulating the system for charging VAT on mobile phones and computer chips traded across frontiers.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07070233000003"></a>The sub-committee concluded that HMRC was right to claim that it was succeeding and that the scale of the fraud in respect of such goods was diminishing. We also thought the Government right to seek EU agreement to a derogation permitting reverse charging in respect of mobile phones and computer chips. That has ended the fraud in this country on these goods. We were delighted about that, although we noted that the scope of the derogation was rather shorter than the Government had wanted, more restricted and only two years rather than the three originally sought. But we became more and more uneasy&#151;or at least I did&#151;as the inquiry went on. Many of us felt that we had stumbled on to a larger issue. The reverse charge derogation is extremely effective but merely transfers the problem elsewhere in the European Union. So its renewal in two years&#146; time is by no means a foregone conclusion. </p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07070233000004"></a>Given the scale of the prize available to the criminal&#151;we were told that the incidence of this fraud in this country reached &#163;3 billion in 2005-06&#151;and the enormous complexity of the defensive extended verification procedures required to combat it, it seemed to us inevitable that, with mobile phones  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_869"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 869</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and computer chips blocked off for the present, the fraud would migrate and mutate to something else. The Government did not dissent. They told us that the next vulnerable sectors would be iPods and satellite navigation systems. They talked then of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, precious metals and computer software, and even, possibly, razor blades or golf clubs; that is, any sector where the traded goods crossing the frontier are high in value and low in volume.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07070233000005"></a>We saw little chance of the Government being able, by a series of successive reverse charges, to pass the buck. We applauded the enforcement efforts, but we thought that the criminal always would be probably a step ahead. The authorities would go on being valiant in trying to plug gaps in the dyke, but we began to wonder whether it might not be better to drain the lake, which is why the second half of our report looks at options for change to the overall EU system as it applies to cross-border trade. In my view, the Government have reacted rather encouragingly to our recommendations. In their reply, they have accepted that there is a systemic weakness in the VAT treatment of cross-border trade and have confirmed that they are actively engaged in exploring, with other EU member states, a number of options for change.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07070233000006"></a>We highlight a number of options in our report, but I want to touch simply on two which seem to be the most promising. The first option would be to move away from today&#146;s destination system, whereby VAT is collected in the country where the goods are finally sold, to an origin system, whereby it is collected in the country where the goods are first produced and then distributed through a clearing-house. That would undoubtedly eliminate missing trader fraud. As the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, said, that was indeed the system which was first proposed and which the United Kingdom hotly opposed in the early 1990s. The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, who is in his place, was eloquent in attacking this system. I worked for him at the time. I could not match his eloquence, but I attacked as his dog of war. </p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07070233000007"></a>The Commission proposed an option system, which was defeated not just by the eloquence of the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, but by the general acceptance around the council table that the clearing house system would be immensely complicated. That is why we ended up with the destination system, which is still known in Brussels as the &#147;provisional&#148; system. It was always envisaged that it would be replaced in due course by an origin system. As the French say, nothing is more permanent than the provisional.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07070233000008"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, said that I should explain why I sinned so greatly. We were trying to build a single market and were getting rid of an enormous number of checks at frontiers, paperwork and documentation, and we succeeded. The 1992 programme brought about a tremendous liberalisation of intra-EU trade, but I now believe, like Lord Keynes, that when the facts change, you had better change your views. I have changed my views on an origin or destination system. The facts have changed. Modern technology now copes perfectly well with a clearing house on the scale envisaged. It  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_870"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 870</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seemed horrifically complex at the time. When one thinks of inter-bank clearing systems or, as the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, said, securities trading, it is perfectly possible to envisage a clearing house system which would work.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07070233000009"></a>Moreover, the Commission now suggests that the VAT which would be remitted through the clearing house should not be at the rates charged in the country of destination but at a flat rate which would be the same wherever the destination. As the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, said, it could be the EU average rate of 15 per cent or the median rate of 18 per cent. It does not matter. The clearing house would deal with only one rate, which would be a huge simplification of the systems and would greatly benefit traders.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07070233000010"></a>I pay tribute to the excellent evidence given to us by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. It came down firmly in favour of a solution on those lines. Government witnesses were rather more cagey and I think that I traced three streams of scepticism. First, there was scepticism about such dependence on IT, which I can understand. Secondly, I thought that I detected a feeling that it would be rash to rely on other member states to be active in the collection of VAT on goods destined for export, because the VAT so collected would be distributed through the clearing house to the country of import&#151;that is, another country. That seemed to me to be a rather unworthy suggestion. Co-operation between national and fiscal authorities in the EU has always been rather good. The current system leaves the Revenue and the honest taxpayer at the mercy of the criminal. Given the choice, I would rather trust the tax man.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07070233000011"></a>The third objection we heard is based on a misunderstanding. It has been suggested that an origin system plus a clearing house might infringe national fiscal sovereignty. This is untrue. Lest noble Lords think my judgment has been coloured by seven years in Brussels, do not take my word for it; take the words of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which is no crazy Euro-phile. Its evidence states that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070233000054"></a>&#147;the harmonisation of rates of tax in member states is not essential in order to operate the origin system&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70702-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07070233000012"></a>The proposed system would not in any way limit our ability to set our own rates of VAT or to continue our zero-rating of particularly sensitive goods. Neither standard rates nor harmonised coverage would be required. Fiscal sovereignty would not be impugned. The difference from the present system would be that the huge rewards available to the criminal would disappear.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07070233000013"></a>If a move to an origin system is thought too dramatic&#151;it certainly would take time and there would be a very high transitional cost&#151;one could envisage a refinement of the destination system which might be equally effective in eliminating fraud. We learnt from the Commission&#146;s evidence&#151;I pay tribute to Commissioner Kovacs and his team for their constructive co-operation with our inquiry&#151;that it has just such a solution on the stocks. It, too, would involve simplification. Instead of obliging the trader to register in the country to which he was exporting his goods, and to pay VAT at the rate applicable in  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_871"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 871</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that country, the Commission now envisages a one-stop shop where the trader would account for all his liabilities in all other member states, online, in his own language, in his country of establishment. It would not be a clearing house but a self-clearing system. This solution, too, would eliminate or massively reduce the scope for missing trader fraud. It, too, would not threaten fiscal sovereignty and would be dependent on effective IT.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07070233000014"></a>I am not an IT expert any more than I am a tax expert, as has already become clear in this debate, but my plea to the Minister is that he urge his new Treasury colleagues to approach both options I have described with an open mind, in a spirit of inquiry about their practicality. The key question is not whether this was something we opposed 15 years ago; it is whether it would work today and prevent fraud tomorrow.</p>

<a name="70702-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07070233000015"></a>There is sometimes too much theology in these matters. Remember Alexander Pope, who said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07070233000049"></a>&#147;For forms of government; let fools contest:</p>
</ul> Whate'er is best administered is best&#148;.
<a name="70702-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07070233000016"></a>The Government deserve our support for their success in getting on top of missing trader fraud in mobile phones and computer chips. I hope that they will be just as successful, although rather more speedily, when the fraud switches to another sector, as it no doubt will. Perhaps it already has. I thank the Government for admitting that there is a systemic weakness which the criminal will always seek to exploit. So the long-term solution is a change of system. The Commission will produce its reform ideas later in the year. I hope that the Government then will come back to the House with their reactions. If they do not agree with the Commission&#146;s proposals, I hope that they will bring forward alternative suggestions for reform.</p>

This report was almost complete by the time I joined. In the few meetings that I had the pleasure of attending, it was a case of running hard to catch up with all the work that the other members had done. I echo the congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, for bringing together this extremely complex matter in this report and for the way in which she has explained the basic issues to the House tonight, issues which were taken up in the contributions by the two noble Lords who spoke afterwards.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07070233000018"></a>The report was published on 25 May, and just a month later a response, dated 25 June, came from Dawn Primarolo on behalf of the Government. Next to her letter is the official government response to the report. There is some progress in that response, although perhaps not as much as we would have liked. As has been mentioned, the Government acknowledge that we are dealing with a systemic problem:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="07070233000050"></a>&#147;MTIC fraud is a sustained and organised criminal attack on the system that exploits a weakness in the VAT treatment of cross border trade in order to commit fraud&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_872"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 872</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07070233000045"></a>That acknowledgement is hugely important. Clearly at the moment the Government are engaged in an enforcement exercise involving 1,500 staff and costing &#163;95 million a year. However effective that enforcement effort may be at what it is focusing on at the moment, the more effective it is at focusing on that, the more the problem will shift elsewhere. There is a huge range of goods which are light, easily moved and of high value to which this fraud can attach. So if it is acknowledged that there is a systemic problem, the obvious answer is to look again at the system, as was acknowledged in evidence given to us on page 98 of our report. Mr Eland, speaking for HMRC, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="07070233000051"></a>&#147;All I would like to say, speaking from an operational perspective if I may, is that yes, it is always the best solution to change the rules so that things cannot happen in the first place. Any enforcement activity is always going to be following on after the event or in response to a failure, if you like, of those rules, so getting the rules right, I agree, is obviously what we want to do&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070233000046"></a>I am delighted to hear that and to repeat what is in an abbreviated form in the main body of the report.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07070233000019"></a>It is now acknowledged that the rules have to change. We examined in the report and set out briefly in the final chapter the options for change. We looked first at a generalised reverse charge or sales tax, then at the origin system, then at a flat-rate origin system and then at the origin system or flat-rate origin system without clearing house&#151;of course, clearing house was considered in that context as well. We deliberately did not recommend a single solution; clearly, individual members of the committee will lead in different directions on this. We were hoping for a detailed response from the Government to these options. There is a certain amount of disappointment on our part at the response received because it is so brief.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07070233000020"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, expressed her view on a generalised reverse charge, which would be like a sales tax, and on the limitations of sales tax. One of the limitations of sales tax was outlined to us in a very stark way in the evidence we received, and I cannot resist the temptation to quote Mr Brown, from Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="07070233000052"></a>&#147;One of the reasons why more countries have been attracted by value added tax as opposed to sales tax is that the fractionated nature of the payment regime means that there is an element of self-policing within the tax system and that that basically provides you with greater taxing power than you would otherwise have. Very few of the sales taxes which operate get into double figures. We do see value added tax at rates of 20 per cent which appear to be sustainable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70702-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07070233000021"></a>That lays it out very simply, very clearly. If you go for a sales tax&#151;which will eliminate missing trader intra-Community fraud completely and save billions of pounds&#151;it will be difficult to persuade the consumer to pay a sales tax of 20-plus per cent, whereas with the fractionated VAT adding up from each transaction and collected in stages, the poor consumer ends up paying 20-plus per cent. He does not notice it so much, except perhaps when he wonders why consumer goods are so much cheaper across the Atlantic than they are here. Part of the reason&#151;although not all of it&#151;why things are cheaper is that they do not have VAT but they have a sales tax. There are other reasons, and I do not want to simplify a highly complicated matter, but I could not resist the temptation of sharing with your  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_873"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 873</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lordships the Treasury&#146;s very stark view of the disadvantages of a sales tax.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07070233000022"></a>In the Government&#146;s response there is not, as I said, a detailed consideration of the options. We are, however, informed that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07070233000053"></a>&#147;The UK and our European partners are looking at these radical approaches, and indeed the Commission is carrying out a study, due to report to the Council by the end of this year, on both the generalised reverse charge and the flat rate taxation of cross border trade with a clearing house system&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070233000047"></a>So two of the options that we mentioned are being discussed, and the Commission will report to the Council at the end of the year. I find this entirely unsatisfactory. There is within the United Kingdom a dissatisfaction with the way in which the European Community so often works. It appears to be beyond our reach and beyond our ability to influence. Things then appear over the horizon quite quickly and take the form of a diktat or directive in which we then find that we have very little say when it comes to legislating here. While I understand the reason for that view, I am not sure that it is always accurate. I find sometimes when one moves about Europe that there is greater openness within European institutions and processes than exists within our own process, and I think this is another case of that.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07070233000023"></a>The Treasury acknowledged in its response to us that it has a systemic problem. The obvious thing to do is to look at ways of curing that systemic problem, and to have a debate in which Members of this House and, through them, the public could become aware of what the problems and options are and could contribute. This is part of what we hoped we would generate by producing this report. We hoped that it would be a springboard for a debate, but the Treasury does not want a debate. It just mentions that there is an issue and says, &#147;We will not talk about it until after we have consulted or completed a process that is taking place in Europe beyond our view and beyond our opportunity to influence. We will wait until the matter comes before the Council for a decision, then we will take whatever decision we think is appropriate and we will come back and tell you&#148;.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07070233000024"></a>Maybe I am extrapolating unfairly from one case, but the real cause of dissatisfaction with the processes within Europe lies in how those processes are handled by our own Government, who do not consult properly their own people, representatives and Parliament but prefer to go to Europe, take a decision and then come back and tell us. That really is not good enough. Maybe I am exaggerating; but the Government, who themselves complain about what they say is the public&#146;s inaccurate view about European processes, could provide for greater transparency. I look forward to the Minister, in his reply, meeting all the desires that I have expressed with regard to generating and carrying through a debate well in advance of any decision in the Council.</p>

First, while we must acknowledge the success of the Government and HMRC in reducing the extent of missing trader fraud in the computer chip and mobile phone trade over the past two years, that has been offset by serious damage caused to legitimate traders in the sector, particularly small companies. Applications for VAT registration, for example, are now taking up to three months for approval, and worse still the process of &#147;extended verification&#148; that is used to check all claims for the refund of VAT are taking up to a year to process. Many small companies have suffered, and in one of many cases reported to us, a company had repayment claims of more than &#163;8 million in VAT withheld for more than a year, and was forced into voluntary administration. Clearly the damage to legitimate business is an unsatisfactory situation and one that cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07070233000027"></a>That brings me to the second important and related issue I wish to stress, one which has also been discussed by the other noble Lords in the debate. Both the extended verification process and the &#147;reverse charge&#148; derogation introduced on 1 June 2007 relate only to the mobile phone and computer chip businesses, and obviously only to UK trade. Clearly the fraud can be switched to other trades or even services, and to other member countries of the European Union, many of which are already experiencing the fraud. It is thus a European problem and the report urges the Government to start discussions with the European Commission and other member states, and to look more sympathetically at a radical change to the VAT system.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07070233000028"></a>In their response, the Government acknowledge that discussions are already taking place, and that the Commission is carrying out a study and is due to report to the Council by the end of this year. The Government insist that any change to the VAT system must fit three criteria: that the right tax ends up in the right place; that the potential for fraud and non-compliance is minimised; and that business is not overly burdened. Those are sensible criteria and the Government take the view that the report&#146;s recommendation for a common, flat rate of 15 per cent on intra-Community trade with or without a clearing house is a possible solution, but would meet the three criteria only if accompanied by a clearing house.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07070233000029"></a>As I have said, this is a European problem and one that Europe must resolve. The report has certainly stimulated discussion and our committee will be monitoring progress with interest in the months to come.</p>

Its best attribute is that it has lots of diagrams. Despite her excellent introductory speech, diagrams and pictures pave the way to accessibility and help people to understand the issue. To echo a point already made, a striking aspect of this problem is that it has come out of the success of the single market. But that was 15 years ago, and during my time of being involved in European affairs&#151;the past 10 to 12 years&#151;it has been a known problem of some magnitude and yet one that we are still left with.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07070233000031"></a>While the report is of very high quality, it makes for a depressing read as it outlines the size of the problem, the simplicity of the crime, and the difficulty in finding solutions. If this sort of crime occurred as single incidents involving each of the hundred or so gangs that get involved in it each year, it would still result in a huge amount of crime. Before the recent tightening-up of the regime, the sums mentioned in the report work out at &#163;50 to &#163;60 per person in the UK. The noble Baroness mentioned the Olympics, but the problem is of equivalent size with the social housing budget of this country, the Royal Navy carriers project currently under way, and is actually similar in size to our annual net contribution to the European Union. A very large amount of money is involved; indeed, it is so large that it is difficult to conceptualise. That is presumably why it does not appear on the front pages of our tabloids each day, as would any other crime committed on a similar scale.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07070233000032"></a>On simplicity, it was staggering to read in the report that although we know about mobile phones and computer chips, along with reverse charging on certain precious commodities, this criminal activity accounts for something like 10 per cent of our total legitimate trade figure. It is a white collar fraud crime of amazing proportions. The noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, is not in his place right now, but he mentioned money-laundering and the banks. I used to be in the financial services sector and I remember spending huge amounts of time with individuals, private citizens, in order to get them to comply with money-laundering rules by asking them to prove who they were as a company secretary or director by showing their passport, driving licence and latest utility bills. We would go through all this, and if we were even slightly concerned about anything we would refer it on to what is now known as SOCA, but at the time was the ICS. We had the impression that all our money-laundering prevention procedures, including those of the banks for the money must pass through their systems, failed in this area.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07070233000033"></a>The solutions are a source of even more frustration. The report has two themes, one of which competently goes through how the system is tweaked at the moment, while the other moves on to highlight how we might start to tackle this crime using either the origin system or, potentially, harmonisation. However, we do not have solutions to the problems of how to implement those proposals. More than that, even if we did come up with a perfect system, particularly for the United Kingdom, we do not have a way to deliver it because taxation is not an area for qualified majority voting. So to achieve this fundamental change in the VAT system, we would  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_876"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 876</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have to have 27 out of 27 member states agreeing in unanimity to changes in the system. So we have problems both in finding solutions and how to apply them. Even if the report from the Commission due at the end of the year comes up with the best solution, can the Government say how we are going politically to deliver it to the Council of Ministers?</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07070233000034"></a>I should like to put one or two further questions to the Minister. First, what is the priority this is likely to be given under the Portuguese presidency, and have the Portuguese mentioned it in their programme for the EU over the next six months. I would particularly like to find out how many prosecutions there have been involving carousel fraud and have those involved anyone other than the minnows. Have any of the main players been prosecuted, and what have the penalties or sentences been?</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07070233000035"></a>What strikes me about the whole subject is the size of the crime. Back when I was 11 years old in 1963 and on holiday in Devon, the Great Train Robbery took place. It was a case of shock-horror when &#163;2.6 million was taken from that mail train in Bedfordshire. Those criminals were eventually apprehended. They each received 30 years&#146; imprisonment. Some escaped; some, I think, are still serving their sentences. Twenty years later, in 1983, we had the Brink&#146;s-Mat robbery, the size of which&#151;&#163;26 million&#151;was quite staggering then. Both crimes have gone down in UK criminal history and folklore. Yet here we have an annual fraud of between &#163;3 billion and &#163;4 billion, perpetrated by as many&#151;or as few&#151;as 100 masterminds. We hear so little about it, and have so little hope of a solution.</p>

It really is a top-class document. Estimates of the size of the fraud vary, but the report states that there is no evidence that the evasion rate is any higher for VAT than for other forms of tax. We should bear that in mind when looking at the problem, so that any remedies are proportionate.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07070233000037"></a>The report quite rightly states that matters cannot be left as they are and that something needs to be done. In her evidence, the right honourable Dawn Primarolo said that action taken so far had been effective in causing,</p>
<ul><a name="07070233000055"></a>&#147;a massive drop to the point where it is now minuscule&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070233000048"></a>Additionally, permission to derogate has now been received for the reverse charge for certain categories of goods. This will continue the downward pressure. Certainly, time should be spent on seeing how the steps already taken turn out. The derogation will have to be renegotiated in two years, giving an in-built date for reviewing the situation. Perhaps if the fraud has migrated to other countries, they will be more anxious to co-operate and may not&#151;as on the occasion of asking for the present derogation&#151;demand a pound of flesh in the form of the UK making further concessions on our rebate.</p>

It is the nature of taxation that there will always be people who seek to evade it. Inevitably, if one door closes, another will open. That may sound defeatist but it is not meant to be. It is an argument for giving the present steps a chance to work, and examining the results before making wholesale changes that may result in different sorts of fraud taking place.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07070233000039"></a>In the event that further changes need to be made, the end-user tax certainly merits a great deal of further consideration. I disagree with the statement that there will be an extra burden on the retailer in the case of an end-user tax. The retailer will still be selling the same quantity of goods, but instead of remitting to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs the VAT on goods sold, less the VAT he has paid to his supplier, he will simply send the VAT on the goods sold: one step fewer, administratively, than at present. Additionally, he will have an improved cash flow, as he will not have to finance VAT on the goods that he has purchased for resale. Administrative costs will be lower and the elimination of the chain would make fraud more difficult. That tax would be collected in one hit, rather than bit by bit, should be no objection, as that is how virtually all tax is collected.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07070233000040"></a>I support the arguments of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs against the origin system favoured by some noble Lords today. I will not repeat those arguments, but they should be listened to most seriously. I share the report&#146;s concerns about potential hardship for businesses and enterprise, highlighted so eloquently both by my noble friend Lord Steinberg and the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold. It is clear from the evidence in the report that the extended verification system has created considerable difficulties for British companies. It is all very well for there to be a process whereby, in the case of hardship, delayed VAT repayments are made. I have no doubt that&#151;and I say this from personal experience&#151;Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will be sympathetic and helpful, but if security or bank guarantees are required for traders to receive delayed repayments, there will certainly be instances where security cannot be given. Companies facing hardship do not usually have surplus or unsecured assets. What happens then? Do they go under, as the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, pointed out has already been happening?</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07070233000041"></a>Add to that joint and several guarantees, and it becomes all too easy for the innocent to be swept up with the guilty. The comment by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, that joint and several guarantees would be difficult to enforce, completely misses the point. The combined effect of the cost of having to defend yourself if accused&#151;however innocent you may be&#151;and the untold stress and time taken up by defence and being many months in arrears on VAT payments, could easily bankrupt almost any business. One arrives at a situation where Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs effectively has the discretion to put any but the strongest companies out of business.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07070233000042"></a>I hope that the application of reverse VAT will substantially change these problems for innocent traders, as they will not have had to finance VAT on purchases. That is another benefit of the end-user tax.

It worked before 1992 with different rates of VAT, so there is no reason why it should not work now. A single market need not mean a single tax system.

It has identified a very real problem. I am happy to relate, as members of the committee who participated in the debate acknowledged, that the Government have been active in response. I recognise that there are anxieties that the response has not been comprehensive enough. Certainly, the committee identified an area of concern, to which the Government have made very significant responses indeed.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07070233000044"></a>We are all aware of the threat. The impact on VAT receipts was estimated at between &#163;2 billion and &#163;3 billion in 2005-06. The measures the Government have taken to stem these losses have been reflected in this debate. We introduced the reverse charge for mobile phones and computer chips from 1 June. I hear what the noble Lord says: mutation&#151;a word to conjure with&#151;will occur with regard to the goods.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07070237000001"></a>I shall respond to the point made by the noble Lords, Lord Steinberg and Lord Cobbold, about the resources used by the Treasury and the Revenue and Customs in dealing with these issues. If a company switches from mobile phones to another significant white good, that may be an indicator to the Revenue and Customs of the mutation to which noble Lords have referred. I emphasise that we are not unaware of these possibilities and will pursue them with vigour. There have been significant numbers of prosecutions of fraudsters in recent years. In August last year, the Revenue and Customs carried out the biggest ever operation targeting VAT fraud. Officers searched more than 160 premises across the UK. To date 18 people have been arrested and charged and we are continuing with these inquiries. There have been notable successes and I assure the noble Lord, Lord Teverson&#151;who, along with the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, earlier in the debate, also commented on this point&#151;that we are devoting resources to these inquiries and they are producing results.</p>

<a name="70702-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07070237000002"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords who have indicated how sharply the authorities need to respond to changes in fraud. We have taken a multi-faceted approach and introduced both criminal and civil measures. Where we have the evidence we use every opportunity to tackle this matter. Freight forwarders, who were introduced into the debate by the noble Lord, Lord Steinberg, are regularly inspected by HMRC. We are active, but we are also conscious that this is a very significant problem, as the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, so accurately defined it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07070237000003"></a>We appreciate that the committee set out to produce a number of potential solutions. I also recognise the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, and nearly all other contributors to the debate&#151;certainly the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, emphasised this&#151;that we cannot make the solution more difficult for business than the fraud. We need to protect the Revenue and we need deal with criminality, but we should bear in mind the impact the measures may have on business. We are concerned that we meet both objectives of ensuring that people pay what they ought to pay through the VAT system and, at the same time, guaranteeing a climate in which legal and lawful businesses can pursue their objectives with a limited amount of difficulty. We have to keep a balance between tackling serious fraud and supporting business.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07070237000004"></a>We aim to process all applications for registration and repayment as efficiently as possible. We are committed to improving the taxpayers&#146; experience in all their dealings with individuals and businesses and to minimising any negative impacts on business; we are out to refine processes and procedures. But noble Lords have identified in the report an area of fraud which needs to be tackled with strong and condign measures. There is bound to be an impact on business and there is some tension in that position which is not altogether remediable.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07070237000005"></a>Checks have caused delays for some applicants. In 2006-07, 7,100 applications for registration were refused on the grounds that they were suspect and 2,500 were registered with specific conditions, such as financial security. This is against a background of 280,000 applications, so one has to keep a sense of scale between the areas where action needs to be taken and constraints imposed and the very large number of applications.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07070237000006"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Cobbold and Lord Howard of Rising, stressed the issue of repayments rather than registration. As regards registration, the average time we expect to take to clear an application is 38 days. That will be too long for some noble Lords but it reflects an effective and appropriate target. It is not as good a performance as we aspire to and we are taking steps to deal with the current delays. An additional 102 staff have been devoted to VAT registration but, as I said, we need to keep this in perspective.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07070237000007"></a>On repayments, HMRC processes some 8 million VAT returns and approximately 2 million of these are for VAT repayments. Of the 2 million returned each year, about 10 per cent fail credibility checks and are selected for further checking. A tiny fraction of these claims are suspected of being linked to fraud and are therefore subjected to the highly targeted process of extended or in-depth verification. We have to keep the number of returns which cause anxiety in perspective. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07070237000008"></a>The committee has identified the cost to the Exchequer and the Revenue of the fraud which is going on; that is why we welcome the report. I appreciated the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, who saw this as a Europe-wide issue; the Government had clearly recognised in their response to the committee report how important this is and  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_880"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 880</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>how we have to work with our European partners to analyse alternative ways to combat fraud. I shall come on to the fact that the committee took matters further and not only identified the problem&#151;that would not suffice for the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, given her role in the committee&#151;but looked at potential solutions, on which I shall comment in particular.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07070237000009"></a>We should remember the criteria we must employ for potential solutions: the right tax has to end up at the right place. Noble Lords have suggested different areas and different stages in the process in which taxation might take place, but the important principle is that the right tax has to end up at the right place. By that I mean the VAT must accrue to the member state of consumption. The solutions must be effective in tackling existing fraud and not vulnerable, as noble Lords have emphasised, to new forms of fraud and non-compliance, which is the danger of the concept of mutation. The solutions should not place an unacceptable burden on business and noble Lords have been at pains to emphasise that we need to strike a balance.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07070237000010"></a>With these criteria in mind, let us look at some of the solutions proposed. First, there are the radical solutions of applying a reverse charge to all goods and services or applying VAT to all intra-community trade. Both of these radical solutions may indeed have an impact on carousel fraud in its current form, the first by deferring the payment of the VAT to the very end of the transaction chain, the point where the goods or services are sold to the final consumer; and the second by greatly reducing the amount of VAT that could be stolen on intra-community supplies.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07070237000011"></a>But both solutions come at a cost. The report accepts that a wide reverse charge would have the effect of turning VAT into a sales tax. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, who advocated the virtues of a sales tax. The weakness of a sales tax is not that the consumer will not pay but that all of the tax falls at the end of the supply chain, where the seller is tempted to withhold all of the tax. A VAT seller, of course, can only withhold a fraction of the tax. Fraud then takes place against the whole of the tax charge when the fraudulent individual moves into action. At least with VAT, it is a case of fractions. Therefore, it is not as if a sales tax is not attended by some difficulties. The report is not about the normal processes of business and its relationship to the Revenue but about those who seek to break the law and to distort the proper amount that they should pay. Therefore, the point about sales tax is not readily accepted by the Government.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07070237000012"></a>The taxation of intra-community trade also presents us with problems. In order to tax intra-community trade, it must first be decided where it is going to be taxed, and that could be either the member state where the customer is established or the member state where the supplier is established. To tax the goods in the member state where the customer is established would mean that businesses making cross-border sales would be required to account for VAT in every member state in which they make a sale. This is worrying for two reasons. First, it places an onerous burden on business and secondly it means  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_881"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 881</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that member states would be faced with the task of attempting to recover VAT from non-established businesses, which is no simple matter.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07070237000013"></a>If taxation of cross-border trade in the member state of the customer throws up some difficulties, another possibility would be to tax cross-border supplies in the member state of the supplier. However, member states have long-standing concerns that to charge tax at the rate of the member state of the supplier would lead to tax harmonisation. Noble Lords may approach that issue with composure. However, that is not the case in many parts of the political community. If there were not harmonisation, all that would happen would be that businesses would relocate to the member state with the lowest VAT rate.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07070237000014"></a>Member states have, indeed, given this issue a lot of consideration, and have recognised that a possible solution to this harmonisation issue could be to tax cross-border trade at a single, fixed rate; for instance, 15 per cent. A minor problem for the United Kingdom is that, with harmonisation at 15 per cent, we would lose about &#8364;8.6 billion, based on figures for 2006. Therefore, we cannot pretend that these issues are easy to resolve. It would not just be Britain. A number of other member states would also lose out with such harmonisation. There might be relatively few winners. Against that background how on earth could we look forward to obtaining agreement on the issue easily within the Community? So the setting up of a mechanism to redistribute the revenue to the member state of consumption is vital, and it is with this thought in mind that the European Commission and member states are taking this work forward.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07070237000015"></a>The report enjoins the British Government and the European Community to give serious thought to this very acute problem. The Government have not dismissed any of these radical solutions and have been actively participating in discussions with our European partners on finding an effective solution to the fraud. The European Commission is committed to producing a report on the feasibility of these solutions by the end of the current year. I hear what noble Lords said about our not having very much time because the derogation lasts for two years only. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, emphasised that point. That reflects the importance of the matter. Action needs to be taken but these are not short-term issues.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07070237000016"></a>That is why we are actively participating in work with our EU partners and the Commission on the second group of solutions&#151;those which seek to improve the working of the current system&#151;because the radical solutions may be difficult to obtain in the immediate future. This includes a wide range of initiatives, such as improving data flows about intra-Community trade and making it easier for member states to exchange information between each other. The Commission is again committed to reporting to the Council its findings, along with any necessary proposals, by the end of the year. We have, of course, been participating vigorously in these discussions.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07070237000017"></a>The Government fully acknowledge the report&#146;s most important proposition&#151;that the Community needs to recognise VAT carousel fraud as a major problem. I say to my noble friend Lady Cohen that that message

However, through the measures we have taken, both within the UK and within the auspices of the developing EU strategy, we believe that we are building the tools necessary to defeat this fraud. We are committed to tackling this issue while at the same time sustaining a business-friendly environment. A balance has to be struck between tackling this appalling abuse, which is so costly to European countries&#151;we recognise the cost to us&#151;and not making the burdens on businesses so onerous that, as several noble Lords emphasised, they can be brought down by the measures taken to control fraud.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07070237000018"></a>We have found the report invaluable in identifying the issues. We are grateful that it put forward solutions, although at this point we have reservations about them. We have reservations about the practicality of obtaining Community agreement on them and about whether they would necessarily make the situation better. However, it is rare for us to have a report which identifies an issue and proposes both short-term and radical solutions. I am grateful to the committee and to my noble friend for having introduced the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07070237000022"></a>Our report was greatly assisted by the presence of one of the architects of the 1992 agreement in the person of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr. It must be unusual to hear such clear and well reasoned arguments for why a change of heart on the part of the Government of the United Kingdom is now both necessary and urgently needed. I am a little disappointed by the Government&#146;s response. Having accepted that there is a systemic problem, the Government surely should be prepared, having willed the end, to will the means to resolve the problem. I hope that some urgent efforts will be made to find a solution. I also offer by way of warning the comment that my committee will do another report fairly shortly when we see what progress is being made.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07070239000003"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, will forgive me for saying that I very much hoped to be the first to welcome his colleague the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, or one of the other Ministers to their new role. They are Ministers for no longer the DTI but the rather inelegantly named DBERR, or Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. It is regulatory reform that is central to my remarks this evening. I know that, although this is pretty detailed and technical stuff, the noble Lord will deal with it with his customary calm, expert and dispassionate approach.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07070239000004"></a>I want to raise concerns about the provisions of the eighth company law directive, which must be implemented by 29 June 2008. I appreciate that the title &#147;eighth company law directive&#148; does not exactly send the parliamentary pulses racing. Nevertheless, these directives contain, sometimes well hidden in the rather leaden prose favoured by Brussels bureaucracy, decisions that can have grave implications for British competitiveness. Nowhere is that truer than in those affecting the UK financial services industry and the City of London. I am afraid to say that all too often this Government have been a bit casual and too ready to accept uncritically what is spoon-fed to them by Brussels.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07070239000005"></a>As an example, last year during the Committee stage of what is now the Companies Act 2006, we on these Benches argued strenuously that the sections in that Act making it a criminal offence, and not as hitherto a civil offence, to fail to comply with provisions regarding takeover documents represented a gold-plating by the DTI of the takeovers directive, a gold-plating that we further suggested was not going to be matched by other EU countries. Not so, said the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, the then Attorney-General, replying for the Government. Far  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_884"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 884</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from it; the proposals were the minimum required. Because at that stage the directive was not yet in force, we could not tell how individual EU countries would comply. Now, 18 months later, we can tell and, according to the paper that was kindly circulated by the department, very few countries have sought to criminalise and none of those is one of the UK&#146;s major competitors.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07070239000006"></a>Another example is the insurance mediation directive, which was published in December 2002 and supposed to be in force before 15 January 2005. According to the City research series, only the Netherlands among the UK&#146;s major competitors has a comparably strict regulatory regime. The French regime is much less proactive, while the German regime is still not yet in place, even two and a half years after the due date.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07070239000007"></a>Tonight, I wish to raise another regulatory imposition that the Government blithely appear to be prepared to accept. I have said that the eighth company law directive is in its final run-in to implementation. While most of the directive deals with auditor training, supervision and so on, and is uncontroversial, hidden away in Articles 41, 45 and 46 are two provisions that will affect listed companies and as such have implications for the competitive position of the London Stock Exchange.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07070239000008"></a>The first of these in Articles 45 and 46 concerns what are known as third-country auditor provisions. The basic premise is that the auditor of any company that issues securities on a regulated market&#151;not including AIM&#151;in an EU member state should be subject to an equivalent minimum level of regulation, even when the company whose securities are being listed is incorporated outside the EU. Noble Lords will note the element of extraterritoriality in those provisions. Equivalence can be achieved in one of two ways: first, if the third country where the auditor is located has equivalent systems on quality assurance, oversight and so forth and that third country agrees to offer reciprocal arrangements to the EU; or, alternatively, through direct regulation by the EU audit regulator.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07070239000009"></a>Consider the position of a company located in an eastern European country outside the EU that wishes to list on the London Stock Exchange. Its accounts are audited by one of the big four firms, but the partnership of the big four firm in that particular country is an independent partnership under the big four &#147;umbrella&#148;. If so, those accounts will not be acceptable unless the country&#151;not the firm&#151;in question demonstrates to the EU that it has equivalent supervisory systems for auditors and that it will offer reciprocal opportunities to the EU. If the above cannot be achieved, the only solution is for the company to have its accounts completely reaudited by a firm within the EU, which is a costly, time-consuming and duplicative exercise.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07070239000010"></a>It does not take much imagination to see from this example that this gives rise to many technical, organisational and indeed diplomatic niceties, including the issue of territoriality. It is no wonder that some have described this as a potential EU Sarbanes-Oxley. Articles 45 and 46 of the directive  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_885"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 885</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may therefore, as a result of the law of unintended consequences, have a similar impact in London to Sarbanes-Oxley in New York. Very few financial centres in the EU other than the London Stock Exchange have many listings of companies from outside the EU, so most EU country Governments are indifferent to these measures. It is London that will suffer most.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07070239000011"></a>Some may think that this is a trivial matter involving few companies and fewer countries. However, the facts are these. The Commission estimates that 220 audit firms from no fewer than 63 countries will be affected. More parochially, the London Stock Exchange has said that there are 320 international issuers on the exchange, with an equity market value of &#163;2,611 billion, or &#163;2.6 trillion. In addition, there are 6,000 international debt securities, which may also be affected. Technical this matter may be, but trivial it most certainly is not.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07070239000012"></a>Secondly, I turn to the provisions of Article 41 concerning audit committees. This is of a lesser order of importance, but nevertheless it is a significant pointer to the attitude and approach adopted by the EU. Article 41 will place a statutory requirement on all listed companies to have an audit committee. Nearly every UK listed company already meets or exceeds this requirement under the provisions of the <I>Combined Code on Corporate Governance</I>. Those that do not have such a committee have to provide a reason for not having one under the &#147;comply or explain&#148; provisions of the combined code. If investors do not like the explanation given, they can choose not to buy the shares or, if they are already shareholders, they can choose to sell their holding. What are we achieving by accepting this clause? The short answer is nothing. In fact, we may even be going backwards, because a statutory role may be regarded as likely to increase the personal liability of the individual director, which may in turn reduce the pool of able men and women who are prepared to assume those responsibilities. That cannot be in the interests of UK plc.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07070239000013"></a>I am very much looking forward to being reassured by the Minister when he replies that the Government have looked into these matters and have everything under control, although in the light of their record to date I will take some convincing. I hope that the Minister will not fall back on the tired arguments that we cannot do anything about the issues now&#151;we have really had enough of doors being slammed after horses have bolted&#151;or that we will defer any difficulties by lengthening the transitional period so that implementation of the provisions is deferred by several years. That would be a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the Government.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07070239000014"></a>First, transitionals do not solve the problem; they only defer it, thus often making it worse, because of the intervening uncertainty. Secondly, transitionals can be implemented only with the consent of member states, thus introducing an element of EU-wide horse-trading. Since few EU Governments have any interest in this matter, for reasons that I have explained, it is hard to see much being achieved. Finally and most significantly, transitionals can be  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_886"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 886</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introduced only where the Commission has made a formal finding that a third country&#146;s regime is not adequate. It will be instructive, to say the least, to watch the reaction in, say, the United States or Japan when those countries are told by the EU authorities that to qualify for transitional status they will have to accept that their existing supervisory regime is not adequate.</p>

<a name="70702-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07070239000015"></a>To conclude, the clock is ticking down fast. Many non-EU countries are very concerned; that is as it may be. What should concern us and, in particular, the Government is the impact on the competitive position of the City of London. As I said at the outset, this is quite technical stuff and it is probably a bit unfair to leave the noble Lord, Lord Evans, to face this bit of fast bowling. However, I hope that when he reports back to this newly named department he will remind it that the last two letters of its new acronym stand for &#147;Regulatory Reform&#148;. This eighth company law directive would be a good place to start to show that the department really means business.</p>

I am also a former chairman of the audit firm, KPMG International. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, on introducing this short debate on the eighth directive, which is of great importance and will be of significant impact if the implementation is not got right.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07070240000004"></a>I sought to try to understand why the eighth directive was what it is and why it came into being. I studied some of the various utterances of the commissioner, Frits Bolkestein, over the gestation time of this directive. Among the reasons that I could distil were, first, that it was a way of giving us better corporate governance within the European Union and more effective audit performance&#151;which are to be applauded&#151;and to make the EU a more competitive place in the capital markets, thus attracting more inward investment in capital markets. Another aspect was a need to avoid the extraterritoriality of Sarbanes-Oxley. Originally, this directive was postulated as a way of preventing Sarbanes-Oxley crossing the Atlantic. Sadly, it has failed, as we all know. We must learn lessons from Sarbanes-Oxley, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said&#151;and I will come back to those in a moment. Was the directive a response to Sarbanes-Oxley as a way of imposing our own extraterritoriality within the EU or to deal with offshore centres&#151;again, a matter of great interest to us&#151;bringing them up to the same standards that we expect within the Union? A final reason was to regulate the EU market, thereby restoring investor confidence.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07070240000005"></a>All, or maybe some, of those reasons have merit and, therefore, I give this directive a cautious welcome. The high ideals of what it seeks to achieve are generally to be encouraged; but at this point it is important to pause for a moment to consider what happens when you get it wrong. You cannot look for a better case study in getting regulation wrong than  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_887"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 887</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what happened with Sarbanes-Oxley. Sarbanes and Oxley are eminent senators who put their Bill together in the United States as a knee-jerk reaction to financial scandals. It moved away from what we have known for years in this country of principles-based, light-touch regulation. The amount of time, money and effort that registrants on the US exchanges had to expend to comply with the initial approach of Sarbanes-Oxley, which was incredibly detailed and very rules-based, has driven capital seekers away from their marketplace in significant numbers. It is no accident that Hank Paulson at the US Treasury is putting great pressure on those who regulate to withdraw a lot of the detail to get the cost of compliance back down.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07070240000006"></a>The danger is that we do exactly the same with a directive like this. Let us look at what appeals in this directive. First, a single audit framework to create a competitive audit market across the EU is to be applauded. Secondly, if, in implementation, we can stick to principles-based standards and independence and get away from mandating rules, we will maintain a light touch in the regulation for which this country is well known and at which it has been successful. Essentially, when you distil what is in this directive, there is a lot that you could say is taking a UK template and applying it to the European Union. That is great if that is what we do. The notion of independent regulation based on the home country model, as it were, will minimise cost and it ought to drive improvements in audit quality. Finally, the requirements for transparency are to be encouraged.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07070240000007"></a>Given all those aspects of the directive that we see as positive, where are the problems? As with many great ideals, the devil is in the detail and I will give just a few examples&#151;different from those given by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson&#151;where I think that there are significant difficulties in the detail. First, the application of the directive is far too wide. The Government must seek to exempt small and medium-size firms from the regulations. I speak with particular knowledge of the cost of compliance. The cost of compliance with this directive, if it applies in its totality, to small and medium-size firms will make them unable to engage in the market.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07070240000008"></a>Secondly, a number of the definitions within the directive are either far too wide or, at best, far too imprecise. I have seen three people look at article 23 which deals with the provision of non-audit services, and I have been given three different interpretations, ranging from a complete prohibition on an auditor doing anything at all for an audit client&#151;the French model, which does not appeal to me&#151;to something that says that it is only what we have in the UK and that there are certain things that an auditor should not do. We cannot allow that to be used within different member countries in different ways&#151;and I shall return to that issue in a moment. Article 36, regarding the dismissal of auditors, is another example of an imprecise definition. What do &#147;proper grounds&#148; constitute? The article states that you can get rid of an auditor only if you have proper grounds. Does the fact that you disagree with him about his fee represent proper grounds? I can assure noble Lords that, in the eyes of many directors, it does. Finally,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_888"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 888</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>touching on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, mandatory audit committees are a bit silly. The one thing that works very well is &#147;comply or explain&#148;. It works well in the UK and it will work well within the European Union.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07070240000009"></a>A final example is that we need to be wary of the notion of other member countries gold plating in a way that provides them with protection over their own affairs. I will give two examples. In France, the Code de d&#233;ontologie, which is at variance with the eighth directive, actually extends extra-territorial service restrictions, adopting the French model of nothing other than audit services. I believe that the UK and the EU should challenge that. In Italy, mandatory audit rotation of firms, not partners, has been maintained. This has been proven not to improve quality; it has added cost and restricted competition within that market. There is no question about that. Italy is also trying to impose extra-territorial service restrictions. Again, I believe the Government should look at this closely.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07070240000010"></a>It is my understanding that the Department of Trade and Industry has consulted widely on this, so I do not suppose that any of my remarks will come as a great surprise to the Minister. I urge the Government to take heed of the responses, particularly those on the detail; otherwise, a great opportunity will be lost. In summary, as I said at the outset, I give this a cautious welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07070240000012"></a>An important issue highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, is that this directive is most important for the United Kingdom because we are clearly now the financial centre of the world. We must be very careful to ensure that a directive that applies to Estonia&#151;I am not sure why I am picking on Estonia; I tend to tease Lembit &#214;pik, but that is probably not appropriate in this august Chamber. Why not? We can be cheeky, can&#146;t we?&#151;does not damage our position as the pre-eminent financial centre of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07070240000013"></a>Following my noble friend Lord Sharman, the relevant department&#151;I have not yet got the acronym, but it used to be called the DTI&#151;</p>

I assume it is taking over the consultation that the DTI started. As I have often said, the Department of Trade and Industry under this Government has been very good in the consultation. Very effective consultation has taken place and the Government have certainly, in this area, often listened to the representations that have been made. There is particular concern here about the consultation&#151;I am making a general point. It is my understanding that we are well ahead of other member states in the consultation exercise; that is inevitably the case as we are the financial centre of the western world.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07070240000016"></a>It is important, however, that that consultation exercise should not lead us into a too firm and restrictive form of regulation; huge detail is going into the consultation exercise. If I may take just one phrase out of the CBI response to consultation, it is that clearly the UK is way ahead in its regulatory approach. A cautious approach, however, will inevitably lead, unless we are careful, to a stricter solution. The point that my noble friend Lord Sharman made is that it would be very dangerous if this consultation exercise, and implementation of the directive, led us to go beyond the general principle of &#147;comply or explain&#148; that works so well in UK at the moment. That is a phrase that all regulators in this area should take on board. The second point that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, touched on&#151;I know having talked to him that he expresses concern about this&#151;is the impact of the directive on non-UK companies being listed in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07070240000017"></a>I am very puzzled by this issue, because two extreme views have been expressed in recent months. First, Paul Boyle, the chief executive of the Financial Reporting Council, says that he is astonished that few in the City have woken up to the impact of the EU directive governing the use of foreign auditors by companies seeking to list on European exchanges. He suggests that the 200-odd non-EU companies listed on the Stock Exchange will be in danger of having to be delisted because of the import of these regulations. However, Adam Kinsley, the director of regulation at the London Stock Exchange, said that a suggestion that foreign companies would be forced to delist was scaremongering.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07070240000018"></a>When the Minister replies, it is important that he indicates whether he believes that Paul Boyle or Adam Kinsley is correct. As a Minister, of course, it is not necessary for him to say whether it is scaremongering. Are the Government concerned, however, that the impact of these regulations will be a reverse Sarbanes-Oxley, and cut off the supply of US companies currently listing in the United Kingdom, or are they satisfied that this will not happen? I suspect that the answer will be because the big four will do all the audit anyway, so they will be able to manage the process&#151;that is maybe a cynical response. Will the Minister indicate whether he believes this represents a threat, if implemented, particularly to US companies listing in London? As a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, and because a lot of their

<a name="07070240000019"></a><b><a name="70702-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07070240000055"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts for giving us the opportunity to debate this directive. European directives are, unfortunately, not the most eye-catching pieces of legislation. As he commented, company law is not doing much to make this one the exception.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07070240000020"></a>Nevertheless, this directive will have an effect, and it is by no means certain that that effect will be beneficial. As my noble friend clearly laid out, with considerably more expertise than I can claim, this directive will quite possibly remove one of the great competitive advantages that helps to make this country's capital a global financial centre. The US seems poised to rethink some of the more onerous parts of the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. The UK cannot therefore rely in future on the excessive regulation of its competitors to ensure its financial health. We must make certain that our regulatory burden is enough to ensure good practice but no more.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07070240000021"></a>This Government have repeatedly stated that they intend to reduce some of the expense of unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy that has been laid upon them in the past 10 years. Indeed, it was one of the cornerstone reasons why they introduced the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. The Government repeated their intention to protect UK companies and British business from excessive regulation, this time from overseas, when debating the Investment Exchanges and Clearing Houses Act. Unfortunately, as my noble friend Lady Noakes pointed out, that Act provided protection only from the United States, not from the EU. Action was certainly needed; the British Chambers of Commerce has estimated the extra cost that Labour has heaped on business since 1998 is &#163;55.66 billion. Three-quarters of this has originated in Europe.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07070240000022"></a>Unfortunately, the Government may be introducing legislation that is designed to unpick the damage that has already been inflicted, but they are not doing anything to stop the new costs that are still being added. The FSA has estimated that the EU's markets in financial instruments directive will cost up to &#163;1.1 billion to implement and over &#163;100 million a year to operate. Does the Minister have any estimate of how much this directive will cost? This directive is yet another clear example that we must start having proper regulatory impact assessment for EU legislation. It is impossible to have an informed debate about these directives, or any of the myriad pieces of EU related law that seem to pass through this House, without them.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07070240000023"></a>When the Minister responds to the questions that my noble friend, those on the other Benches and I have raised, I hope that he will also be able to explain why his Government fail to undertake proper assessment of EU regulations.</p>

The whole tone was summed up by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, who said that the danger in such a directive is what happens when you get it wrong. I hope that my comments will reassure noble Lords.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07070240000025"></a>I start by nailing the Sarbanes-Oxley example. This is not an EU version of Sarbanes-Oxley. The London Stock Exchange has commented that although it is important to get implementation of the directive right&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, stressed that&#151;it is important to note that this is not a Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07070240000026"></a>Before I turn to some of the important points that have been made and the questions raised, I want to comment on the general context and objectives behind the new directive. As we heard, last week saw the establishment of the new Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Noble Lords have stressed the importance of regulatory reform, and that message will be taken back to the new department. The department has a clear focus to promote productivity, enterprise, competition, trade and better regulation within a framework of free and fair markets.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07070240000027"></a>I am sure that all noble Lords agree that these are vital for maintaining and strengthening a vibrant British business sector. We hope that the new department will provide a strong voice for business and regulatory reform within Whitehall.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07070240000028"></a>The reporting and auditing framework must ensure that interested parties and others are provided with fair and accurate information. But the framework must operate efficiently and in a way that minimises the regulatory burden. Both objectives are vital to maintaining and building on the competitiveness of our capital markets and of course to their attractiveness to international investors and issuers. Another point that has emerged is a concern that this directive may have an effect on that very thing.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07070240000029"></a>The potential impact of loss of investor confidence across Europe and globally is immense. It has been estimated by academic studies that the loss in stock market wealth in the US as a result of the Enron and WorldCom scandals was $38.2 billion in the first year. The Government reviewed and strengthened regulation of audit and accounting after Enron to protect against the risk of similar events in the future. But, in doing so, we were very careful to build on and preserve the strengths of our existing system and to avoid overly burdensome new regulations. We were careful to maintain the strengths of the &#147;comply or explain&#148; approach to corporate governance. We built on the sound achievement of the existing self-regulatory regime and enhanced the remit of the Financial Reporting Council.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07070240000030"></a>At European level, the new audit directive seeks to enhance confidence in the financial statements and annual reports published by companies across the EU. The aim is to achieve this objective by strengthening the EU framework of standards and  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_892"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 892</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public oversight for the audit profession, in particular for the audits of larger, publicly listed companies, and by introducing new provisions for auditors from non-EU countries. I will come back to that question.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07070240000031"></a>This is a &#147;minimum harmonisation&#148; directive, intended to establish a set of basic principles for the conduct and oversight of statutory audits conducted in the EU. The directive clarifies the duties of statutory auditors and provides for their independence and ethical standards. It introduces a requirement for external quality assurance and provides for public oversight of the audit profession, including third country auditors, and improved co-operation between oversight bodies in the EU. It also provides a basis for international co-operation between regulators in the EU and with regulators in third countries.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07070240000032"></a>The UK already enjoys a high level of confidence in the quality of its financial reporting, the professionalism of our accounting and auditing community, and the general quality of governance in our public companies. Furthermore, as a result of the regulatory reforms we have already made, we are in the enviable position of already having many of the audit directive provisions in place. Implementation of many of the provisions will therefore require little, if any, change to existing auditing practice or to regulation.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07070240000033"></a>There are, however, various new provisions in the directive. These include measures which will, for the first time, extend to auditors from third countries. I now turn to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, about the provisions on third country auditors, and concerns reflected by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07070240000034"></a>Noble Lords are right to draw particular attention to the importance of these provisions and the need to ensure that detailed implementation is practical and proportionate. This is a complex, technical process involving detailed discussions with the relevant authorities in the UK, the European Commission and other member states, and, indeed, with third country authorities. We understand that these discussions are ongoing.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07070240000035"></a>The provisions extend elements of the EU&#146;s regulatory system to those non-EU auditors who audit companies that issue securities on EU-regulated markets. The intention behind them is to provide investors in the UK and other EU markets with enhanced comfort that financial statements have been audited by auditors subject to minimum levels of regulation equivalent to those in the EU. These provisions are particularly important for the UK, in view of the large number of non-EU companies whose shares are traded in London&#151;a point stressed by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, and others. They are also important to other member states with growing international capital markets and to the economic development of the EU as a whole.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07070240000036"></a>As with other aspects of the directive, these provisions have to strike a balance, providing important protections to investors while keeping regulation efficient and cost-effective for the benefit of all. It is equally important to get the balance right  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_893"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column 893</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in how the provisions are implemented and particularly in how the flexibilities provided for in the directive are used.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07070240000037"></a>Therefore, under the directive, if an auditor is subject to an equivalent regulatory system in his home country, it is not necessary to make him or her subject to the UK regulatory regime. In such cases, the directive enables the auditors&#146; home country regime to be relied on. It is for the European Commission, acting with member states under comitology, to make determinations of equivalence. There is also provision for the Commission to provide transitional arrangements for countries which do not have equivalent regimes but which are developing their own regulatory systems along similar lines.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07070240000038"></a>The Commission consulted publicly earlier in the year on its approach to these decisions. Market players and other interested parties, including the London Stock Exchange and many from the UK, welcomed the pragmatic nature of the Commission&#146;s proposal. In particular, they welcome the intention to rely, wherever possible, on home country audit regulations.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07070240000039"></a>The Government, along with the Financial Reporting Council, are working with the Commission and other member states to determine the best approach in the light of that consultation. The Government and the FRC have worked closely and effectively in planning for the directive&#146;s implementation and developing a joint approach to the discussions with the European Commission and other nation states in the implementation of the provisions on third party auditors.</p>

<a name="70702-0013.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07070240000040"></a>The FRC and the Government are keen to make sure that the detailed implementation of these provisions works effectively in practice. The FRC supports the Government&#146;s approach. The Government have consulted extensively on both the negotiation and implementation of the directive. A consultation document was published in 2004 and a wide range of interested parties commented on the proposals. Since the directive&#146;s adoption, we have worked closely with all our stakeholders and delivery partners to develop proposals for the directive&#146;s implementation into UK law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07070240000041"></a>We published a full consultation document in March setting out an approach. The consultation included a revised draft regulatory impact

We are grateful for the many constructive responses and continue to work on drafting these regulations. We hope to publish our response to that consultation and the draft regulation shortly and look forward to receiving any comments from those noble Lords who have taken part in this debate.</p>

<a name="70702-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07070240000042"></a>In the one minute remaining, I will deal with the matter of audit committees raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord Sharman. As noted, the directive introduces a new requirement that listed companies should have an audit committee or a body performing equivalent functions. That goes beyond UK provision&#151;where provisions on the composition and role of audit committees are set out in the combined code on corporate governance.</p>

<a name="70702-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07070240000043"></a>This code operates on a &#147;comply or explain&#148; basis. In a consultation document published earlier this year, the Government set out a number of options for implementing the requirement. We are also keen to stimulate debate among interested parties as the best way forward to help us deliver the route wanted by the market.</p>

<a name="70702-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07070240000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, asked what the dismissal of auditors only on &#147;proper grounds&#148; means. We agree that &#147;proper grounds&#148; is a broad concept. However, this is exactly the type of thing that can be sensibly assessed only in the circumstances of particular cases. The important point is that shareholders have an additional protection against auditors being dismissed where the reason is that the directors or dominant shareholders disagree with the way in which the auditors are doing their job.</p>

<a name="70702-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07070240000045"></a>I have the answers to four more questions, but have run out of time. If I may, I will write to noble Lords, sending copies to everyone who has taken part in the debate. I once again thank the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for introducing what has been an interesting hour or so.</p>

We seek to bring those disparate groups of people together so that they can be managed more coherently and the powers can be shared.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000011"></a>At the moment, different people exercise different powers. It is often the case, particularly at small courts, that the degree of protection required is not always available. We would ensure that the 10,000 or so people who are currently employed in different agencies will be brought together as the basis of a new force. Specialisation of police services has proved effective elsewhere in the Home Office estate. Criminals involved in people trafficking and international terrorism are ever-more resourceful, sophisticated and pernicious. We need a unified force to detect illegal immigration, prevent the misery of the trade in human beings that we all abhor and, above all, to prevent the entry into the United Kingdom of terrorists or suspected terrorists.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000012"></a>We are considering in some detail whether the new force should be part of SOCA. Ministers will be all too well aware that we asked the noble Lord, Lord Stevens, to look at the details of our proposals and we are very grateful to him for having undertaken that work. He said that it is essential that Britain should have secure borders and that one element of that must be a dedicated and effective border police force. Indeed, both the previous and current Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police are also in favour. So is the Home Affairs Committee of another place, which recommended in its 2001 report on border controls that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000370"></a>&#147;existing border control agencies should be combined into a single frontier force on the basis of secondment and direct employment, but with clear lines of communication back to the parent agencies. Pending the creation of a single frontier force, strategic co-direction of better joint working should be provided by a ministerial group&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000332"></a>That was all of six years ago. So far, the Government appear to have failed to take effective action on those recommendations.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000013"></a>There has been a lot of talk about ID cards as the main solution. They are not. We believe that they would waste billions of pounds without performing one of the most basic tasks, that of securing the borders. Although we recognise the role of having identity cards within the immigration system, that is very different from a national identity register, which is a much wider issue.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000014"></a>My amendments were debated in another place, but I believe that it is important to address them here so that this Committee may have the opportunity to comment upon them. This is part of a consultation process that we have initiated. On that basis alone, the amendments would be probing even if they had been debated on the Floor of the House instead of here in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000015"></a>Any country serious about its security should have properly policed borders. I beg to move.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000351"></a> Before Clause 1, leave out lines 5 to 10 and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;(a) protecting UK borders;(b) strengthening frontier protection against threats to the security, social and economic integrity and environment of the United Kingdom;(c) preventing and detecting human trafficking;(d) maintaining and improving a safe, ordered and secure environment in ports; and(e) such other functions as the Secretary of State may by order determine.&#148;
<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000017"></a>The noble Lord said: We certainly agree with the principle of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, that a unified border force should be created. It is Liberal Democrat party policy to do that, because we would like to see united the present border control functions of HM Revenue and Customs, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, which has become the Border and Immigration Agency, and the police, who cover various functions at ports and airports. We would integrate all those agencies into a stronger and more co-ordinated national border force. We accept that major crime is no longer, even essentially, a local issue, and that the modern criminal is likely to be linked, either directly or indirectly, to international networks, and that the UK&#146;s border control arrangements are currently under disparate control structures such as I have mentioned&#151;the police, the customs and the Immigration Service&#151;and are not as well co-ordinated as they might be.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000018"></a>However, there are some differences between our proposals and those which were laid before Members of the Committee by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. We want to see a proper integrated presence at the borders and the airports. That is what the focus of a border force should be to secure the United Kingdom&#146;s borders. A Liberal Democrat border force would strengthen our borders against terrorism, drug-smuggling and organised immigration crime, and it might even include a maritime interdiction capability to work alongside Royal Navy patrols and perhaps include also the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It would also take on the responsibilities for incoming goods, which are currently exercised by trading standards.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000019"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, mentioned the reports of the House of Commons Select Committee that dealt with the creation of a co-ordinated national border force, particularly the report of January 2001, which highlighted the problems that arise from having this variety of agencies carry out controls at the borders and the ports. The committee reported:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000352"></a>&#147;The different agencies operate in slightly different ways, depending on the trained skills of staff, objectives and priorities, equipment, facilities and legal basis. This produces results such as: passengers and vehicles having to pass through two or more separate controls at ports; different agencies operate independent databases with varying degrees of national networking&#151;Immigration Service and Special Branch do not have direct access to Customs&#146; OASIS system, including the Ferry Information System; separate budgets for advanced technology are too small for major projects; intelligence is not as widely shared as it ought to be; some officers on duty at the point of delivery do not have full powers to carry out necessary border control functions on behalf of others; cross-posting or  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>secondment, sharing of facilities and joint training do not appear to be as extensive as they might be; at some ports only one of the border agencies is regularly present&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000333"></a>That is a pretty stark indictment of the present arrangements, which a single frontier force would do much to counter. It would provide a more co-ordinated fight against organised crime, a larger pooled budget for development, acquisition and use of advanced technology, closer integration of the computer databases that they each have to use, and communication systems and increased flexibility in deploying resources.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000020"></a>I recognise that some of the benefits that you would expect to see from a UK border force can be achieved by the Government&#146;s border management programme, about which perhaps the Minister will have more to say in reply to this debate. It brings together the border control agencies to discuss joint ways in which to work. The example that was given by a Minister in another place is that at Gatwick, immigration officers are now acting as the primary interventions agency on behalf of other agents. Customs and police officers are providing the BIA with specific information about people and immigration officers, who see every person going through Gatwick airport, are identifying people who may be of interest to Customs and passing those persons across to it. In freight search operations, the BIA and Customs both have teams, and existing legislation allows officers to act as immigration officers in specified circumstances. That is particularly the case when they find people hidden in vehicles that they are searching for contraband.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000021"></a>These are all good steps towards more integrated working but, surely, if the BIA, Customs and police were operating under unified management, there would be economies at the management level and at the coal face where the officers are working because of the greater interoperability of staff engaged at present on three different but closely related groups of tasks. The UK border force would act under legislation which, I accept, would need to be drafted&#151;we have not done that in the amendments that we are considering this afternoon. If the Government were disposed to accept either of the solutions offered by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, or ourselves, a considerable amount of extra work would be needed to put flesh on the bones.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000022"></a>The legislation would confer on the UK border force all the powers that are at present exercised by the police, Customs and immigration officers in protecting our borders. The legislation would give them the flexibility and cohesiveness that co-operation between three different agencies with overlapping functions could never wholly achieve. The Government estimate that it would cost &#163;104 million to provide 24-hour cover at all ports of entry to the UK, which may or may not be operationally necessary. A more comprehensive service would be possible without any additional cost through the improved use of resources that would follow the unification of the three existing agencies into a border force. I hope that if the Government are not convinced by our arguments, they will at least say that

<p><a name="07070242000024"></a>On the drafting of Amendment No. 1, I question whether in subsection (2)(a),</p>

It seems to me very important that the Government should think hard about this matter, particularly today, when the public may be more aware than they were of the importance of knowing who we have in this country and who we do not&#151;who lives here and who does not. No one is more anxious to ensure that we have properly controlled borders than those who have come here legally as immigrants or those whose forebears came here before them.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000028"></a>I live in Scotland and I want to say a word more about this matter in connection with Amendment No. 3. Until Saturday, I think that there was rather less strong feeling on this subject in Scotland than there is today. The explosion in Glasgow struck home very much with the people of Scotland, who may be feeling more a part of the United Kingdom in this respect than previously.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000029"></a>My noble friend&#146;s amendment would establish a UK border police force and, in some ways, it would be a simple way of doing what needs to be done. The consultation that she recommends would be very important&#151;particularly consultation with the public, who would come to see the best and most secure way of proceeding. It is a very big subject and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, but I think that my noble friend has made a good suggestion. Of course, I was interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said. He is talking about the same thing, but my noble friend&#146;s amendment is probably the right one.</p>

The report

I hope that that is helpful.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000031"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07070242000399"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for putting forward her amendment and to all Members of the Committee who have contributed to the debate thus far. I readily concede that this is an important debate, and certainly the issues raised are of considerable importance, not least since the events that took place towards the end of last week. No doubt, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, made clear, those events have focused our minds somewhat.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000032"></a>There have been repeated calls for the creation of a unified body such as a UK border police force and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said, that was debated extensively in Committee in another place, and rightly so. As my honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, Liam Byrne, made clear, the Government certainly retain an open mind regarding the longer term but, at this point, we are not persuaded that the establishment of a UK border police force is necessary.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000033"></a>However, I underline that recent ministerial and other changes indicate the Government&#146;s commitment to drawing on a very broad range of talent to ensure that Ministers get the best advice on protecting the public and on other areas of government. We believe that the most effective means of strengthening our borders is to continue to have three distinct agencies focusing on their respective priorities, while working closely together to maximise the opportunities for protecting the public. My honourable friend the Minister in another place drew a comparison with the way in which the Armed Forces are organised.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000034"></a>We would not consider merging these three distinct services with their specialisms, histories and cultures into one, but we insist that they co-ordinate their intelligence and tactical deployment. That is what we need to do here and that is the model that we have adopted for the border agencies. We already have in place a successful joint working structure in the Border Management Programme, to which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred. That has already delivered models for improved intelligence, joint risk assessment and more effective border controls, where each agency can act on behalf of the others to increase drug seizures, reduce people smuggling and, importantly, counter the threat from terrorism.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000035"></a>There are many practical examples of how the current structure works well. In Gatwick, we have immigration officers using Customs powers to identity people smuggling drugs; at the port of Immingham, Customs officers are using immigration powers to search for people being smuggled in freight; and at Blackpool, police are using Customs powers to search for smuggled tobacco. I argue that those are real, tangible results which reduce harm to the UK and the public. To create a single UK border police force would require significant infrastructure changes. </p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000036"></a>At the moment, I am not sure we could honestly justify that. It would carry additional and significant

We know that the international experience is very mixed. In the US and Canada the creation of single border entities in 2002 has not delivered the benefits that were expected. Indeed, five years later, despite changing the badges of the staff at the border, different offices continue to specialise in terrorism, drugs and illegal immigration. In Australia, Customs officers operate the primary intervention capability on behalf of the immigration department. That operates well, given the unique geographical circumstances that exist in that part of the world and the fact that everyone who travels to Australia has a visa in advance&#151;virtual or otherwise. Those approaches have in common the fact that they do not include police in a border control capacity.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000037"></a>A single border force may be eye-catching, but it ignores the complexity of the challenge.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000038"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07070242000400"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> Has the Minister taken into account the views of the Association of Chief Police Officers or has a consultation taken place with the police? From yesterday's announcement, we now know that the Prime Minister has appointed the noble Lord, Lord Stevens, as an adviser on security at the Met. Surely this is the time to take into account one point of view, that of the police, on whether that is a viable alternative and whether it would be more effective than separate agencies, as the Minister has suggested.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000039"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07070242000401"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Yes, we have consulted ACPO in the past. We know that it was uncertain about the benefits of a single agency and we know that it has given the matter further thought. Yes, of course, we continue to listen to our advisers. At the outset, I made the point that we continue to consult with our advisers and experts on this.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000040"></a>A short list of the threats that we face includes terrorism, organised illegal immigration and narcotics smugglers. We have highly skilled specialised individuals to match these threats and overarching structures to meet the challenge. Quite simply, a single border force risks being dysfunctional. Immigration checks at the border must be part of an overall system of immigration control, including visas and in-country checks. Police work needs to be linked to national policing and clearly accountable to the communities it serves. Collection of revenue and the prevention of fraud need to come under the control of the Treasury.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000041"></a>Previously, we set up the Serious Organised Crime Agency, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, to unify our efforts against class A drugs and organised immigration crime. That recognised the overlap in this area and demonstrated our commitment to joining up agency resources where there was a clear need to do so.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000042"></a>The border management programme is delivering closer and more effective working between the border agencies. It will bring about a cohesive and integrated border security infrastructure and allow us to maintain the expertise of the individual agencies.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000043"></a>I argue that people on the front line need legal powers to face up to the challenges now facing the United Kingdom. That is why we have legislated to improve our ability to share information, for example, and why we will press forward to get new powers that address the capability gaps, not the presentation of our border service.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000044"></a>We need to move beyond the idea of concentrating solely on geographically fixed borders. Increasingly, we will need to export our border. We want to prevent problems before they arrive in the UK, not just patch them up afterwards. We have already introduced juxtaposed controls and airline liaison officers who will roll out biometric visas, for example. We are committed to strengthening our borders. We are delivering this by allowing each agency to focus on its respective priorities while unblocking the barriers to deeper inter-agency co-operation. A single border police force is not, at present, what the UK needs.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000045"></a>I think that I have responded to most of the points. Perhaps I missed one raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about technology. The Government&#146;s e-borders system is of course a multi-agency platform. It will support increased intelligence sharing and joint risk assessment as well as providing for more effective border processing. That can be done, and it works well with the current border management programme. Immigration and customs officers are also already cross-posted at front-line level under that border management programme.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000049"></a>I ask the Minister not to think that there is too close an analogy between these agencies and the Armed Forces.

Particularly with the current concerns about terrorist activity, one may decide to invest heavily in interesting and large initiatives, whereas in the longer term one may need to concentrate on building capacity, including the workforce, with sensible measures such as this secondment between different agencies.</p>

No doubt a lot of questions will be asked not only today but on other occasions that would perhaps be best answered at some descriptive length.

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the drafting of my amendment, and he did so quite rightly. One advantage of Grand Committee&#151;there are few, but this is one&#151;is that one may table probing amendments such as this as part of a consultation process. Unfortunately, one of the great disadvantages is that that also makes one rather sloppy in tabling amendments, because they do not have to be perfect as one knows that one cannot divide upon them. If one tried to do so, the whole of Grand Committee would be suspended and we would have to move into the Chamber to continue. I have never seen anybody brave enough to do that yet, and I am not starting that trend&#151;yet.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000055"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred to two points. First, in subsection (2), on the order in which the items fall, I agree with him entirely. If I were to put the items in order of preference, subsection (2)(a),</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000372"></a>&#147;detecting and removing illegal overstayers&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000335"></a>would not have been at the top of my list. However, as with all lists drafted in this way, this is not put in order of preference. That is my only defence of myself with regard to this. I certainly think that if one presented this as a government policy, one would have to consider very carefully where one&#146;s priorities lay.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000056"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the drafting of subsections (3) and (5) and pointed out correctly that the British Transport Police have been omitted. I could do a weasel defence and say that they would be covered in subsection (5)(f), but I take his point exactly. He is right in saying that they are important, and have been so especially, as one has seen, in terrorism attempts in the past few years. If I brought this amendment back, I would ensure that the British Transport Police formed part of that drafting.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, began as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, pointed out by saying that the Government had an open mind, but their mind seemed to get more closed as his response progressed. He said that three agencies should remain and gave his reasons for so believing. He said, too, that a single force was not what the United Kingdom needed, which looked as if it closed the door. I hope that consideration will remain as to the best way in which to develop our security.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000058"></a>I noted with interest the appointment of Sir Alan West as Home Office Minister to serve in this House. He has a long and distinguished career in security matters. We will wait to see what influence he may have on Home Office policy-making, but we hope that it will be as constructive as his previous career would lead us to believe it should be. But it is, of course, always a case of whether the Home Office will listen&#151;that is the problem.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000059"></a>I conclude by reiterating that this was part of our consultation process. We recognise fully that there is a joint determination by all parties and groups, including the Cross-Benchers in this House, to secure our borders. It is a question not only of the right way to do it but of what is the most efficient way to do it. I listened carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said on that, and he is right. It is a case of trying to ensure that one delivers an efficient and co-ordinated response. How one does that, we will continue to consider.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000354"></a>&#147;(4) The Secretary of State shall make regulations setting out the necessary qualifications and training for a designated immigration officer.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000355"></a>(5) Regulations under subsection (4) shall be published no less than six months before the commencement of section 1 of this Act.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000066"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment requires the Secretary of State to publish regulations setting out the training that should be carried out by designated immigration officers.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000067"></a>Clauses 1 to 4 allow for the designation of immigration officers. Officers who are designated by the Secretary of State will be able to exercise detention powers against anyone who is&#151;or who they suspect is&#151;about to commit an offence, or who they suspect is committing or has committed an offence. The power is very wide. After detention a police officer must be called to attend and detention cannot exceed three hours. These powers are similar to other powers under Section 24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, amended by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, to create standardised arrest powers for non-policing bodies. However, the powers in Clause 1 go further than Section 24A in that they allow for search and for the use of reasonable force to detain. Clause 3 also creates specific offences of absconding from, assaulting or obstructing a designated officer.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000068"></a>As a consequence, the powers of designated immigration officers will be more on a par with those enjoyed by officers of HM Revenue and Customs as opposed to other quasi-policing officials such as police community support officers. I fully accept that there will be occasions where it is appropriate to detain and search when there is no constable present. However I also note that this extension is part of what appears to be a general trend to grant powers traditionally reserved for the police to those who have not received policing training. That is of some concern, and I expressed those concerns during passage of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act as well.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000069"></a>Clause 1(2)(b) states specifically that the immigration officer detaining an individual prior to arrest should be &#147;suitably trained&#148;, but there is no reference to regulations or other training documents to define what &#147;suitably trained&#148; means. My amendment asks the Government to justify the omission of training requirements from the Bill. Does the Minister accept that immigration officers should  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC42"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be given comparable training to police custody sergeants or their equivalent? Why should we avoid clarity about the regulations which should set out the designation and training process in some detail? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000070"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07070242000411"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> I am delighted to support the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. I can think of hardly any Bill on which the two of us have worked when the training issue has not been taken very seriously, and this is no exception. I support the amendment because of my serious concern about the often subjective decisions taken by immigration officers, particularly entry clearance officers abroad, which affect the entry of people coming to the United Kingdom. In this instance, we have designated additional powers to some of these officers. Even if you accepted that idea, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was right to point out, the rules under which police powers are governed according to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act are not clear. Are we certain that these officers will be trained according to their responsibilities under that Act, and where does accountability for the decision-making process ultimately lie so far as concerns these designated officers?</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000071"></a>I want to mention a very important point, which I raised during debate on the previous legislation. Then, I asked whether immigration officers were receiving training on police powers, the misuse of those powers and the responsibilities of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. I raise this now because, on the previous occasion, it took Ministers no less than six months to write to me about it formally. It became clear that those who were designated with additional powers&#151;not in this country but outside the United Kingdom, particularly on the French border&#151;did not come within the jurisdiction of the IPCC. The IPCC had no powers or resources to deal with complaints against those who had been designated with this sort of responsibility. Therefore, I want to find out whether the Minister has considered not only extended training for these officers but their accountability with regard to these additional powers. If not, what is their status in relation to the complaints machinery?</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000072"></a>I should be very glad to support the second part of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, which says that regulations are to be published no less than six months before the commencement of the section. I think that that is right. People and Parliament should know what these regulations are and effectively how they are being implemented. Therefore, from these Benches, I am delighted to support the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000073"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07070242000412"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I support Amendment No. 3 and point out that it concerns one of the many points raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. However, I question whether &#147;regulations&#148; is the right word to use. It may over-formalise the situation a little on the off-chance that the Government feel like accepting the amendment or one similar to it. Clearly acceptable publication setting out the necessary training and qualifications will be very important.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000074"></a>The amendment also gives me an opportunity to refer to a practice which I understand is currently used by both immigration officers and police&#151;namely, the stopping and questioning of, in particular, Muslim people entering or leaving this country. It can be seen as a form of discrimination and can cause a great deal of resentment and alienation. I recall that this practice was used regularly during the long years of emergency in Northern Ireland on the ferries between Northern Ireland and Scotland and possibly also Liverpool, and it was sometimes applied at airports for travellers from Northern Ireland. I should be very surprised if, in that case, it ever produced any solid evidence that did any real good, and I would question the practice now.</p>

Can the Minister say whether there will be a lead immigration officer in each smaller area with special expertise in child protection and an understanding of the needs of children so that he can support his fellow colleagues when implementing these sorts of powers? Can he give some information on what sort of training on the needs of children will be available to immigration officers when they use these new stronger powers?</p>
<h5><a name="07070242000382"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000076"></a>There is some parallel with examples in other parts of government policy of spreading power from one body of professionals to another body of professionals or non-professionals; for example, police and community support officers, midwives and paramidwives and teachers and teaching assistants. There are benefits in that policy but, in practice, it is often found that problems arise unless it is implemented well. For instance, there has been considerable concern that teaching assistants have not had the right training to work with children with special needs and, in some areas, there has been concern that community support officers are not getting the right mentoring when they first enter practice. I shall not go on but perhaps the Minister will acknowledge that, when one spreads powers in this way, careful attention needs to be paid to implementation so that there is no poor execution.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000077"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07070242000414"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I hope that my noble friend will be able to take seriously the case put forward in this amendment. In almost any area of law enforcement or penal policy, as the policy and its implementation move forward, it becomes clear that training is crucial, not least in the sphere of human rights. The balance between law enforcement and human rights is very difficult and it needs sensitive and careful preparation. During recent visits to the police, I have been tremendously impressed by how the police here&#151;and now in Northern Ireland&#151;take account of that difficult balance and of how it must be pursued seriously. It cannot be rushed; it has to be carefully prepared. For that reason and a host of other reasons, there is a lot of merit in the amendment, and I hope that my noble friend will be able to take it very seriously.</p>

Clause 1 states that a person may be a designated immigration officer only if he is fit and proper for the purpose and suitably trained. The question is: what does that mean? My noble friend&#146;s amendment is an attempt to help the Government to define it. It is as simple as that.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000079"></a>As we are on Clause 1, perhaps I may ask the Minister a general question. The Bill is about the United Kingdom&#146;s borders, and it is strange that Clauses 1 to 4 do not apply to Scotland. I understand that the reason is that, when drafting the Bill, the Government consulted the previous Scottish Executive, which was a Liberal/Labour coalition, about whether they would allow the Bill to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. They had to ask because policing is a delegated function and the Bill is closely integrated with the police. That Scottish Executive said that they wanted to legislate separately. That was a slightly strange decision because one of the borders is, in any case, a joint border&#151;the one between Scotland and England&#151;and people can come into England and Wales via Scotland, as they have been doing. It was a slightly strange decision, but they said that they did not want that part of the Bill to apply to Scotland.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000080"></a>Since then, there has been an election in Scotland and there is a new Scottish Executive&#151;a minority Scottish National Party Administration. Have the Government consulted that Administration since the elections about whether they continue to want to legislate separately? I ask that because it seemed rather a strange decision by the previous Administration. Even if they have, I wonder whether it would be wise to speak to them again. As I said on the previous amendment, opinion in Scotland seems to have been rather shaken on this whole subject, and the wisdom of a common system under Clauses 1 to 4 might appeal to them more now than it did before. It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us where we are on that and, regardless of where we are, the Government might even try again if they need to. This is quite important.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000081"></a>I do not think that this part of the Bill will be effective if it does not apply to Scotland. I see the problems because of the interaction with the local police, but I should have thought that they could be overcome. All the Scots Parliament needs to do is to pass a Sewel motion, which would allow the Government to amend the Bill so that the whole of it could apply to Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000084"></a>Many of the people coming here will be totally devoid of knowledge of the English language. Do we expect that some of those trained as immigration officers will be able to carry out interviews in, say, eastern European or Asian languages, or will adequate translators always be available? I was in Spain about a week ago. I do not speak any Spanish and trying to get a cup of tea was a wee bit difficult. Many people coming here are at a total loss. If the amendment is accepted, what does the Minister see as the type of qualification that will be necessary?</p>

One can talk to someone experienced in one&#146;s line of work about one&#146;s cases and reflect with them on what were the good things one did and how one might have done the job differently. I should be grateful if the Minister could also provide information on how immigration officers are supervised and whether there might be any special supervision for these designated officers.</p>

Considering the debate that we had on the previous amendment, where we were talking about the interoperability of services at ports of entry and the exchange of roles between the Immigration Service on one hand and customs and the police on the other, it is even more important than it would previously have been for us to know what kind of training these people are to have. They will be asked to do a wide variety of jobs which are not necessarily within the sphere of the Immigration Service. At times, they may be called upon, as part of the joint teams with customs, to look at freight wagons for illegal entrants. Under the Bill, they will have powers which were formerly exercisable only by the police. Will the training given to those officers include any knowledge of the functions of Customs and Revenue and the police respectively? If the noble Lord cannot answer that this afternoon, perhaps he could write to us so that we can return to the point later, if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000087"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="07070242000420"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> This has been a very useful and wide-ranging debate. It has raised some questions that I shall endeavour to answer this afternoon and, if I cannot, of course I shall answer them at a later date. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for opening up the interesting discussion on training. As the services work ever closer together at border control centres, because of the issue of interoperability referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, it is extremely important that they work together well and understand each others&#146; different roles and that there is some common core training at the heart of it all, so that many of the interrelated issues are understood.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000088"></a>Before I deal with training, I shall set out the Government&#146;s justification for seeking powers generally in Clauses 1 to 4. As we noted in the debate on the first group of amendments, the key priority for

Project Semaphore, the test-bed for the full e-borders system, is now receiving data from 56 carriers operating to and from 99 non-UK airports and seaports. To date, over 10,730 multi-agency alerts have been issued with over 950 arrests being made. That part of the exercise is working well.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70702-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000089"></a>Those figures show that at ports where a police officer is not in attendance, there is a role for designated immigration officers. They can help the police by acting in support of the police until such time as a constable can attend and assume responsibility for an individual.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000090"></a>As I said at the outset, it is very important that each understands the distinct roles, that there is training common to all and that a common understanding is developed as part of that. The Government, of course, agree that immigration officers exercising any<I></I>powers should receive the appropriate training and have the necessary qualifications.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000091"></a>I shall explain why the Government consider Amendment No. 3 unnecessary and I hope to provide the noble Baroness and others with assurance on that. The Bill already sets out sufficient safeguards in that officers may be designated only where the Secretary of State is satisfied that they are fit and proper for the purpose and have been suitably trained. The Bill also provides for designation to be revoked at any time. New training will be based around existing good practice and will be likely to mirror closely the existing training for immigration officers who exercise powers of arrest. In collaboration with police colleagues, we are developing specific criteria for the designation of immigration officers.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000092"></a>The Border and Immigration Agency already has experience of implementing similar certification arrangements for other groups. For example, procedures are in place for the authorisation of detainee custody officers and for search officers, which require the Secretary of State to be similarly satisfied that a person is fit and proper to carry out his duties. We are using these procedures as a blueprint for this regime.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000093"></a>It is vital that we retain the flexibility to amend these policies and guidelines quickly and efficiently as the business demands. If we were to go along the route of regulations, that would require that any amendments to those policies and guidelines would need to come before Parliament on each and every occasion, even when only small changes were to be made. I would argue, not least for some of the reasons given by noble Lords this afternoon, that that would be unwise, inflexible and not fit for the purpose. We are content to make the more detailed designation criteria and the details of the training schedule available as and when they are developed. I do not consider the amendment to be necessary, because it would create a disproportionate regulatory burden where alternative mechanisms can be put in place.</p>

Immigration officers already have powers of arrest, together with search and seizure powers. They are enabled to use reasonable force to carry out their duties, which must relate to immigration practices. As I have argued already, training will be consistent with police training and in keeping with current training for arrest-trained officers. Training is delivered by police specialists, and we will make public the training standards.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000095"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, was rightly concerned about accountability. The accountability of immigration officers will be via their senior officer command structure and, ultimately, to the chief executive of the Border and Immigration Agency. We are consulting on the extent of oversight at the Independent Police Complaints Commission, but it is likely that officers exercising powers under these provisions will be subject to the IPCC in terms of serious complaints. I suspect that we are moving in the direction that the noble Lord anticipates; I know that we will be debating amendments on this issue later.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000096"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, spoke about safeguards for children and childcare issues. We understand that and will be debating those issues later. The detention of children under Clauses 1 to 4 would occur only in the most exceptional and rare cases, and that is right. When we develop the procedures that I have talked about, we will continue to work with the police to determine when it might be appropriate to detain a child under these provisions. It is fair to reflect that safeguards are already in place at ports in relation to immigration officers&#146; existing powers of detention, including the fact that staff are specially trained to deal with minors at ports of entry. Comprehensive children&#146;s guidance is issued to all operational staff, and that will continue to be the case. These safeguards will be extended to cover children detained under these provisions. We accept that the work has to be of a continuing nature and we must seek to attain the highest possible standards.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000097"></a>Immigration officers work closely with child protection experts. Operation Paladin at Heathrow provides a useful example of where a multi-agency approach in general to safeguard children is adopted, involving the social services departments, the police from the relevant authority adjacent to the port of entry, airport, and so on. This is best practice in the field, and we are continuing to develop it as we learn and understand more.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000098"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, rightly raised the Scottish aspect. As ever, she demonstrated how on the ball she was with developments north of the Border. We have had discussions with the Scottish Executive, who concluded that the routine presence of police officers at all seven international ports in Scotland meant that it was unnecessary to provide immigration officers with devolved powers. They have also reflected that it is their right to make that decision and, as the noble Baroness observed, they can choose to legislate if they wish. That is their right. We are satisfied that that does not compromise border security, given the level of international traffic. We are  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>committed to working closely with ACPO Scotland to ensure that this is effective. We have had discussions with the Scottish Executive since the outcome of the Scottish elections was clear, and they continue to hold to the position. We will continue dialogue with them, and recent events mean that that dialogue must be of a more intense nature. However, we are content with the current situation.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000099"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about fit and proper persons. We are developing a fit and proper persons test. It will include appropriate security clearance, a Criminal Records Bureau check and the successful completion of a probationary period of at least a year. There will be a proper selection process, and candidates will have to succeed on a pass/fail training course.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000100"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, raised the issue of customer service training. The noble Lord is right to make the point that immigration staff can be the first point of contact when people come to this country, perhaps sometimes in a slightly confused state and not understanding the language or being unable to communicate as effectively as they would wish. That is an experience that we all suffer or enjoy at various times when we go about the world. The customer services training qualification will be similar to that developed in the criminal justice system under the &#147;narrowing the justice gap&#148; policy. Staff are trained to deal with people appropriately and sensitively. That is a key skill for all persons engaged in the criminal justice system, and it is very important here. We will need to revisit the issue and ensure that staff have access&#151;</p>

Immigration officers are encouraged to speak other languages, and translation of our literature is a key feature of our customer interaction. Particularly in the larger volume ports and airports, we try to ensure that there is reasonable and easy access to languages where there is a particular problem or difficulty. We are very proud of that service and we seek to continue to develop it.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000103"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked a question about the Republic of Ireland. We have a regular dialogue with the Republic about immigration matters and our respective processes and systems. We have spoken in detail about the Bill. We understand that the Republic is in the process of debating immigration legislation, so the importance of the question is plain. We need to continue that dialogue. The Republic will, no doubt, be seeking our advice and we will benefit from its reflection on what we are trying to do.</p>

It was not exactly the same as my information, but doubtless I was informed wrongly that the Executive intended to legislation themselves. From what the Minister said, the Executive think that their existing arrangements are adequate and that they do not require designated immigration officers. That means that, in effect, Clauses 1 to 4 will not always apply to England because people will be able to cross the Border unless it is policed in a way that it could not possibly be: to keep people coming from Scotland into England. Anyone who knows that Border knows that crossing it is easy; the grouse do it.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000107"></a>It would be worth the Government keeping in touch with the Scottish Executive now, as the Minister said his department would. They may have changed their minds. This is a UK Borders Bill but whether that is the right name for the Bill, because of Clauses 1 to 4, I am not sure. I have not been into this in great depth, but I talked to one or two people and got slightly different information, so I realise that that was incorrect. I see from those behind the Minister, who are nodding, that I am right in thinking that there is an intention to do nothing.</p>

It would be interesting to know what that power is and whether the police in Scotland think that they can carry out these functions without the benefit of Clauses1 to 4.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000109"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07070242000427"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> I wish that I could fill in the necessary information but I am afraid that I cannot; I am simply not in a position to do so. The Minister might want to go into that himself. That is the nub of the matter. Will the United Kingdom have the benefit of the Bill if Scotland does not play ball?</p>

I should be grateful if he could write to me about supervision. I should be interested to know whether immigration officers have regular opportunities for a one-to-one discussion with their line manager about their practice or what other mechanisms are in place to encourage reflection on practice by immigration officers. Training is obviously one means of doing that.</p>

On the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC50"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC50</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we will of course keep that issue under review as part of our dialogue with the Scottish Executive. We have police officers in all the ports who believe that they have the necessary powers. The Scottish Executive take the view that they do not need the legislation in the way that the noble Baroness has set out. That is the situation, but it is one of those things that can change, as the noble Baroness well knows.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000112"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07070242000430"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s encouraging news about accountability. However, the point at issue&#151;which, as I said, I raised in the last immigration debate&#151;is the accountability of people designated at British posts abroad, particularly in France, where they exercise powers similar to those of immigration officers. When I last raised this issue, the Minister wrote to me saying that they did not fall under the jurisdiction of the IPCC. I take issue with that. You cannot have two groups of people, one of which in this country is ultimately accountable to the IPCC and the other abroad with similar powers but without that accountability. I am not asking for a reply now, because the Minister has been positive in his response so far, but can he look at that issue again? I obviously intend to discuss this with the IPCC to see how we will take the matter further.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000113"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07070242000431"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I will reflect on the noble Lord&#146;s last point. I do not believe that the IPCC could have jurisdiction abroad in this instance, but we need to look at the designation of those officers operating from abroad. The noble Lord has raised an important point and we will certainly have another look at it.</p>

We have had some very helpful responses from him, although he said no to my amendment. However, we have made some progress. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Carnegy for raising the Scottish questions. It is important to have that on the record. My colleagues in another place will want to look at the Minister's responses before considering whether any relevant amendments might be appropriate at Report. That was a very interesting response.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000115"></a>On child protection, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked a question about responsibility which I did not hear the Minister answer. wish to do so under my Amendment No. 13. He asked whether there would be a lead immigration officer on child protection. I know that the Minister was thinking in terms of Clauses 1 to 4 only, but the noble Earl's question is relevant to Amendment No. 13, which addresses how an immigration agency operates overall. The noble Earl has made an important point.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000116"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in supporting my amendment in principle, quite correctly, holed it below the waterline. I entirely agree with him, which means I have to agree with the Minister, which is worse&#151;it is easier to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. Regulations would be over-prescriptive and would over-fetter. One needs something more flexible&#151;the Government&#146;s word&#151;and the Minister

I was grateful to hear him say that details could be made available as and when guidelines and training are developed. Is he able to say today whether that is likely to be in time for Report, which will not be until October in this House? He might want to reflect on that, but it would mean that we might have an opportunity to consider them when we debate the matter in October. That could be considered in the Summer Recess.</p>

I shall certainly have further discussions with officials and ask what we can do. It would be desirable to put as much of this material as possible into the public domain.</p>

It may resolve some of the remaining concerns among Members of the Committee about Clauses 1 to 4&#151;that may be a way round the matter. I listened to all the points made very properly by Members of the Committee. We are talking about immigration officers who have an almost impossible task&#151;not one I would relish. They act as meeters and greeters and as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, who is no longer in his place, introduced his question, I was thinking that we are trying to put an almost impossible list of responsibilities on our immigration officers.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000119"></a>When someone enters the country, immigration officers do not know by looking at them whether they are a likely terrorist or whether they are likely to take violent action against them. Although not a terrorist, someone might have another reason to be violent, and immigration officers do not know whether the distress that person is expressing is genuine. They have to be aware that a person may have experienced torture or oppression overseas and that this is the only country where they may find help. However, they may be what one could call a con artist. We are expecting our immigration officers to perform a hugely difficult task and I put on record my thanks to them for trying to do their very best. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000120"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000122"></a>The noble Lord said: In framing this amendment and in deciding how to present it, we are greatly indebted to Mr Richard Thomas, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers who, as Members of the Committee may appreciate, gave evidence to the Commons Standing Committee. The practice of hearing evidence in Standing Committee is one that we should consider for Grand Committee in this House, particularly on Bills that start at this end. I  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC52"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be grateful for any observations that the Minister or the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, may care to make on that idea. If it seemed to have support from everyone in Grand Committee, it might be fed into the Procedure Committee or whoever is responsible for these matters at this end of the Corridor. The experiment in the other place was extremely successful and the expert evidence that was taken was valuable in informing subsequent discussions. I am sure that the same thing would happen if we had experts before us in Grand Committee here.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000123"></a>The new powers introduced by Clauses 1 to 4 come without any corresponding regulatory or oversight frameworks, including provision for the introduction of prescribed codes of practice. Once an immigration officer has been designated, he or she will enjoy considerable power, covering not only detention but search and the use of reasonable force. Anyone who absconds from a designated immigration officer will commit an offence attracting a custodial sentence. The powers normally available to those who are not constables are contained in Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and are more limited. This extension is part of a general trend to grant powers that are traditionally reserved for the police to those who have not received police training. </p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000124"></a>In the 1999, 2002 and 2004 Acts, additional powers were given to immigration officers, but in none of those provisions was there any equivalent statutory code of conduct and training that has hitherto applied to police officers who are formally exercising the powers under the 1984 Act. Designated immigration officers will be acting in sensitive situations, where a wrong move could have serious political repercussions or harm extremely vulnerable people. Such considerations led to the PACE code of conduct in the first place and I think that on the whole, with some exceptions, that framework meant that the public had confidence in the way that the police exercised those powers. We want to ensure that, whatever powers are transferred from the police to immigration officers, there is no dilution in the standards that have applied to the operations concerned. In our opinion, this amendment is the right way to do that. However, if the Minister says, as we expect, that the PACE code of conduct is not applicable in its entirety to the powers of detention and search which are to be assumed by immigration officers, I hope he will point out the provisions in PACE that do not read across. I hope that he will explain why, after the Bill has been before Parliament for six months, we are no further forward in distinguishing between those parts of PACE that would apply and those that would not.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000125"></a>Mr Richard Thomas, who, as I mentioned, gave evidence to the Standing Committee in another place, told the committee that, from his experience in prosecuting immigration offences, there were not enough trained immigration officers to do the new jobs being imposed on them by the Bill. That was placing a strain on the police and taking them away from the serious border crime that the public would want to see policed. He was not saying that immigration officers should not have the additional  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>duties placed on them by the Bill but only that the work should be carried out within a framework equal or equivalent to PACE. Here we are, four months after he gave that evidence to the Standing Committee in another place, still none the wiser&#151;for example, about how immigration officers would use force under Clause 2(4)&#151;than when Mr Tony Smith, director of UK border control at the BIA, said in response to a question:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000358"></a>&#147;I cannot tell you in detail what a use of force policy might look like at the border&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000126"></a>The Minister, Mr Liam Byrne, told the Standing Committee that there would be &#147;operational guidance&#148;, which of course does not have the same legal force as a statutory code of conduct, but it was being discussed with organisations such as the Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association, ACPO, the Police Standards Unit and trade unions&#151;particularly the Public and Commercial Services Union&#151;which have to bear on the decision. Why is Parliament not included in these discussions? If the only reason for having a code of conduct that is not the same as PACE is that immigration officers are not being required to conduct investigations, as the Minister at the other end of the Corridor said, surely four months ought to have been enough to draft an amended code based on PACE to accommodate this distinction.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000127"></a>If PACE protections such as recording facilities are not appropriate because nothing that an immigration officer says to a person when detaining or searching him, using reasonable force against him or handing him over to a police constable would be relevant in subsequent processes or inquiries&#151;which is not quite as obvious to me as it was to the Minister&#151;then the case needs to be argued and not taken for granted. And having decided on the code of conduct, there is then the question of what is the most appropriate and transparent form of oversight and scrutiny of the Immigration Service, including&#151;as my noble friend Lord Dholakia said&#151;the role of the IPCC, a matter which again another place left to be decided later, as we shall be considering on the next amendment.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000128"></a>Unfortunately, the code of conduct is not to be subject to parliamentary approval. The Minister said that doing so would deny the Government the flexibility they needed to update those provisions at will, as the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, repeated again this afternoon. However, as the honourable Member Mr Damian Green pointed out, the whole purpose of Parliament is to approve or disapprove of proposals by the Executive. What the Government are trying to do here, in giving themselves absolute discretion over the code of conduct which is to govern the activities of immigration officers, is unacceptable, particularly when it comes on top of the three previous Bills which I mentioned and in which the powers of immigration officers have been extended without any accompanying code of conduct, let alone one that is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. In his maiden speech as Prime Minister, Mr Gordon Brown said this is to be a new Government, aiming for,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000373"></a>&#147;change to build trust in government&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000336"></a>Let this be one of the first tests of whether he meant it. I beg to move.</p>

I do that because that committee gave serious consideration to the Bill and has published its observations in its report of 14 May 2007. Some of my amendments will be very closely related to the recommendations of that report. I therefore hope that my noble friends will agree that I should not go through all the arguments we cover, because they are there to be read, but I may refer to some of them. I say at the outset that much of what I say on this amendment will overlap with what was so well said&#151;characteristically well said&#151;by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000130"></a>We noted that the power of a constable to arrest under Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to which the noble Lord has returned, is closely regulated by Code G of that Act&#146;s codes of practice. This code prescribes a number of important requirements regulating the way in which the power is exercised, concerning, for example, the information to be given to a person on arrest and the making of a record for the reasons of the arrest. Police powers to search and seize are also subjected to rigorous controls contained in the relevant PACE code of practice, Code A.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000131"></a>The Joint Committee in its considerations recognised that immigration officers&#146; existing powers to detain, search and seize for immigration purposes are not subject to PACE codes of practice. The committee noted, however, that, on the Government&#146;s own account, the very purpose of conferring the new powers on immigration officers in the Bill is to provide them with powers which are exercisable in connection with criminal offences rather than immigration offences. Such a role in support of the police appeared to the committee to be in the nature of a general policing function, and it therefore thought it appropriate that the Police and Criminal Evidence Act codes of practices should apply to regulate the use of these powers to detain, search and seize in view of their impact on the European convention rights.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000133"></a>The committee noted that the standard operating procedures, which it is said will regulate the exercise of the powers, have yet to be drawn up&#151;the noble Lord referred to that and emphasised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny&#151;and will not be subject to any parliamentary scrutiny nor to any requirement that they be publicly accessible. The committee was therefore concerned that the standard operating procedures on a number of accounts were inadequate. It asked, for example, whether they will be sufficiently accessible by the public to satisfy the principle of legal certainty, whether they will have received sufficient public scrutiny when being devised and whether their content will be sufficient to make it unlikely that the powers will be used in a way which interferes with the various European convention rights affected. The committee therefore recommended that the Bill should be amended to provide that the relevant PACE codes of practice apply to the new powers of immigration officers to detain, search and seize pending the arrival of a police constable. My amendment would give effect to that recommendation by the Joint Committee.</p>

It would be helpful to know.</p>

As we have heard, the Bill will allow designated immigration officers to detain people for up to three hours and use reasonable force so to do. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, highlighted, the Joint Committee on Human Rights has expressed concern at the lack of scrutiny and transparency in drawing up the standard operating procedures that will attempt to prevent the powers being abused. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for drawing attention to the remarks made by my honourable friend Damian Green in the other place. He asked what Parliament is for if not to approve codes of practice. That was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Judd.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000138"></a>On these Benches, we are not yet convinced that the committee&#146;s recommendation to extend PACE codes to these officials is the best way forward. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, would turn immigration officers into even more of a quasi-police force than the Bill already does, but without the training or expertise of police officers.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000139"></a>Illegal immigration is a long-running and complex issue, yet this Government&#146;s approach continues to be a series of badly-thought-out patch jobs. They tweak the system here, add on a bit there and hope that one day they will be magically close to the last loophole and then everything will run smoothly. That is not the way to do it. If the Government listened to Conservative proposals for a dedicated, trained and targeted border police force, these difficulties could be properly resolved before the legislation is introduced.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000141"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07070242000441"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am, as ever, grateful to Members of the Committee who raised these important issues. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Judd, for leading off on their amendments in a spirit of co-operation, giving fair consideration to the points and the issues. There are already some situations where immigration officers are subject to PACE codes of practice, but in other cases they are not. As many noble Lords know, PACE codes are specific to those with a duty to investigate offences and, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, noted, that is a key dividing line. In considering whether PACE codes of practice are relevant to the powers in Clauses 1 to 4, we need to look at the functions that a designated immigration officer will exercise. It is also worth considering how those functions relate to existing powers.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000142"></a>The power to detain in the Bill is specifically intended to support the police at the border by detaining individuals of interest pending the arrival of a police constable: that is its primary purpose. It will be for the constable to decide whether the person should be arrested. The key point is that designated officers will simply be acting in support of the police, not on behalf of the police. This is an important distinction when comparing these powers to the role of a community support officer who acts on behalf of the police and is consequently subject to PACE codes. That is a clear distinction. Immigration officers exercising the power will not carry out any of the major substantive functions of a police constable, such as questioning, arrest, investigation or specific evidence collection. They may search the individual only for anything that might be used to assist escape or cause physical injury; in other words, it will be a defensive search. They can retain and give to a constable any such item as well as any item they believe to be evidence of the commission of an offence, but the substantive police constable functions will remain fully under the control of the police.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000143"></a>The designated immigration officer will be under a duty to arrange for a constable to attend as soon as reasonably practical. We expect that, in practice, the period of detention in most cases will be short. In any event, it is subject to a maximum period of three hours. The detention-related activities carried out by a designated immigration officer do not constitute part of the investigative procedure conducted by a police officer. Detention carried out by immigration officers under immigration powers is not subject to PACE codes of practice. We do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate for detention under these provisions to be subject to those codes.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000144"></a>The Bill already contains significant legislative safeguards. Immigration officers may be designated only when the Secretary of State is satisfied that they are fit and proper persons for the purpose and have been suitably trained. The Bill also states that a designation may be revoked at any time. It is intended that, where an officer fails at any time to meet the criteria for  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>designation, then the designation will be revoked. In collaboration with the police, specific criteria for the designation of immigration officers are being developed. The Border and Immigration Agency is also developing, in collaboration with the police, comprehensive standard operating procedures that designated officers will be bound by. We have today placed in the Libraries of both Houses those draft designation principles and the draft standard operating procedures. Members of the Committee will have the benefit of being able to view those and make their views known. They are high level and signal our intentions in this area. We intend to continue our process of consultation with the police&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07070242000145"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07070242000442"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The Minister mentioned the comprehensive standard operating procedures which he said had been published today and are in the Printed Paper Office. In am in the hands of the Committee on this, but should those documents not be present in the Grand Committee so that noble Lords can refer to them here? We cannot leave the Grand Committee to go to the Printed Paper Office and fetch them, and are therefore unable to see whether the procedures which the Minister thinks meet the requirements of the JCHR actually do so. While we are having this discussion, it would be useful if we could at least glance at them, even if we could not study them in detail.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000146"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07070242000443"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> As I explained, they have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. They are drafts and are there for comment. No doubt there will be further comments on them, and we will need to publish revisions and publicly place them in the Library. I am happy to try and furnish the noble Lord, and other noble Lords, with copies if we can do that. I question how helpful they would be to us today, but I am happy to try to make copies as available as possible.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000147"></a>I have tried to explain why we consider that statutory application of the PACE codes of practice to the detention-at-port provisions is neither necessary nor appropriate. Noble Lords will know that PACE codes are currently under review. Much of the Government&#146;s ambition in this area is to reduce the administrative burden on police and simplify procedures. Similarly, we do not want to impose any greater burden on immigration officers than necessary&#151;a point which the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, alluded to.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000148"></a>None the less, we recognise that certain aspects of those provisions may fall within the spirit of the codes, and accordingly we will seek to reflect certain key safeguards contained within PACE codes A, C and G within the final standard operating procedures. Such safeguards will include requirements to use the power fairly and responsibly, with respect for people being searched and without unlawful discrimination; to provide a clear demonstration of the reason why a designated immigration officer thinks that a person may be liable to arrest; to inform the detainee of the reason for detention and advise that they may be searched to determine whether they are carrying anything that may be used to assist escape or cause

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000149"></a>We intend that the oversight arrangements to monitor the use of powers in Clause 2 will be similar to those currently in existence for the similar powers of detention for immigration purposes. These arrangements cover processes such as the administrative arrangements for authorisations and review by senior officers. They also cover redress, including transparent and accountable complaints procedures as communicated to passengers at ports, in our formal correspondence and contained on our website. Additionally, they cover conditions of detention, such as oversight by independent monitoring boards, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, and Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000156"></a>In concert with my friend, the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, we take a common view that the adoption of PACE codes would be unnecessarily bureaucratic, inflexible and perhaps inappropriate. However, we are trying to bring in to our standard operating procedures the spirit of those PACE codes in the way in which these matters will be conducted and the oversight and accountability mechanisms in place. We will have the benefit of PACE, which we all agree has worked very well over the past 23 years, but we will also have some necessary flexibility. There will no doubt be an opportunity between Committee and Report for noble Lords to reflect on the drafts that have been provided.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000157"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07070242000448"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> If I understood the Minister correctly, he was arguing that it would be too onerous and there would be too much record-keeping if the codes of practice currently applied to the police were also applied to the designated immigration officers. Can he therefore say whether the same considerations apply to the proposal contained in Amendment No. 6, which has been spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Judd? If they do not, do other and different considerations apply to it? Could the Minister also tell us how many designated immigration officers there are likely to be for the whole of the United Kingdom?</p>

<p><a name="07070242000158"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07070242000449"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My understanding is that there will be about 1,000 designated officers. On the noble Lord&#146;s point about Amendment No. 6, we think that we have the balance about right in the way in which we have set out our standard operating procedures. Ultimately that is a judgment with which people will agree or disagree. I suggest that the noble Lord take the opportunity of seeing whether he thinks that the procedures fairly reflect what I have said. We do not want to be over-encumbered with bureaucracy, but we recognise and accept that there need to be acceptable levels of recording and lines of accountability.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000159"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07070242000450"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I am very grateful to the Minister for what he said. We must all take seriously the news that the standard operating procedures are now available, and I am glad to hear it. However, I am sure that he will take in the best possible part the observation that it might have been helpful if they had been available before this debate so that we could have considered whether or how far they met our concerns and taken it into account.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000160"></a>I understand the argument of the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, about quasi-border police forces. I understand that the Opposition want a proper border police force as they see it. However, that is what we have at the moment. It is happening every day and will go on happening every day while we decide whether we will have future legislation on a border police force. Therefore, we need effective arrangements immediately.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000161"></a>I was concerned by what the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, because it is my impression that many of the serious issues arise in those first three hours  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when people are detained. For that reason, we have to take the matter seriously. However, I acknowledge what the Minister said. I understood him to say that the procedures have been placed in the Library as a basis for consultation and so are not yet finalised. We must go away and look at this matter. Therefore, I shall not move my amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000162"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07070242000451"></a>Viscount Bridgeman:</b> We on these Benches are pleased to be of assistance to the Government and to my friend&#151;in a non-parliamentary context&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bassam. However, has he addressed the point about the approval of Parliament, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, especially in the light of the Prime Minister&#146;s declared intention to give an increased role to it?</p>

<p><a name="07070242000163"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="07070242000452"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Viscount gets me to put on the record the fact that the procedures will not be directly approved by Parliament, but we have had extensive consultation. They are in the Library; I have asked officials to provide copies to Members of the Committee. We will receive with interest comment on both the draft designation principles and the standard operating procedures. If we were to go along the route of parliamentary approval, which I do not think the noble Viscount is suggesting that we do, we would be locked into something that is less manageable as a practical working document. I accept that the PACE codes are revisable, but they take longer to be revised and are, in a sense, less flexible. A balance between the two has to be struck, and we think that we have got it about right. I invite Committee colleagues to look at what we have provided and reflect perhaps, as we have to do, between this stage and Report.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000164"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="07070242000453"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I am grateful to all those who have taken part in the debate on this amendment, particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, with his experience on the JCHR, for explaining why the JCHR recommended that the PACE code of conduct should be adopted. I wish that it had been possible for us to scrutinise the comprehensive standard operating procedures which the Minister said have been published today so that we could have seen to what extent they matched up with the PACE code of conduct and whether the exclusions simply catered for the fact that, as Ministers told the JCHR, there was no investigation procedure in this instance.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000165"></a>The Minister should recognise that the JCHR considered the point which he again made today&#151;that immigration officers&#146; existing powers to detain, search and seize for immigration purposes were not subject to the code of practice. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, emphasised that the JCHR stated that the immigration officers who exercised their powers under this Bill would do so in connection with criminal offences and not with immigration offences, and that that role appeared to be in the nature of a general policing function and was therefore appropriate to the PACE code of practice. The Minister did not deal with that point.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000166"></a>It is a pity that we did not also have in front of us the Government&#146;s response to the JCHR report, which I take it that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, would have mentioned if it had been available. The amount of time that has elapsed between 14 May and 2 July is not excessive in terms of the time that Governments normally take to respond to JCHR recommendations, although it would have been useful to have their response to the report in time for us to look at it in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000167"></a>I was encouraged by what the Minister said about the transfer of some provisions of the PACE code of conduct into the comprehensive standard operating procedures. He said that immigration officers would have to inform the detainee of the reasons for their detention, that there would have to be a record of the detention and that there would have to be access to a telephone and so on.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000168"></a>Since the noble Lord, Lord Judd, the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, and I are at one in suggesting that documents which bear on the proceedings of the Grand Committee should be available in the Room and not at the Printed Paper Office, the Minister should take up the matter through the usual channels, perhaps with the Procedure Committee, to make sure that on future occasions when a Minister refers to a document that is immediately germane to the proceedings under consideration, that document is available on the spot and not just in the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000169"></a>I was also encouraged to hear what the Minister said about the chief inspector of the BIA and his role, but he slightly marred the point when he said that a decision had yet to be made on whether the chief inspector would be empowered to report on the detention procedures, which is the whole point. If the chief inspector was excluded from looking at one aspect of the BIA&#146;s functions, that would be an unnecessary limitation on his powers and would mean that he did not have a role that corresponded with that of other chief inspectors such as the Chief Inspector of Prisons, who has no limitations on her role.</p>

I would hope that the chief inspector would have that role and that there would be no limitation on his or her power to scrutinise any of the functions whatever that were exercisable by the BIA, by analogy with the powers of the Chief Inspector of Prisons, for example.

We would anticipate that the use of the IPCC would occur only very rarely as, if we are successful in persuading the Government to accept some amendment similar to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on training at a later stage, immigration officers would operate to a very high standard. The Minister has assured us that that will be so.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000177"></a>It is important that in the event of something going wrong a person would be able to make a complaint to an independent body and that they would be confident of the procedures that that body uses to investigate the complaint and that specific action will be taken to resolve the complaint.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000178"></a>The Minister in another place said that following the augmented role for the IPCC in specified functions provided for in Section 41 of the Police and Justice Act 2006, a consultation was planned on what precisely the IPCC&#146;s remit should be. I assume that that was not intended to be a formal consultation because I could not find any mention of it on the Home Office website. We would like to know how it is being conducted, and on the basis of what draft proposals. The Minister said that the consultation on precisely which immigration functions would be subject to the IPCC&#146;s scrutiny would commence on 7 May and that he hoped that by the end of July or into the summer the consultation would be complete so that over the summer the Government could lay regulations. We would like to see the draft proposals that were tabled on 7 May to have an opportunity to comment on them during the passage of this Bill through Grand Committee or, if that is not possible, at the very latest, at Report stage so that we can have a say before the regulations are set in stone. I beg to move.</p>

It is our view that these amendments are unnecessary. We intend that the oversight arrangements to monitor the use of the powers contained in Clause 2 will be similar to those currently in existence for the similar powers of detention for immigration purposes. These arrangements cover the following: process, such as administrative arrangements for authorisations and review by senior officers; redress, such as transparent and accountable complaints procedures as communicated to passengers at ports, in our formal correspondence and contained on our website; and conditions of detention, such as oversight by an independent monitoring board, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000182"></a>Section 41 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 enables the Secretary of State, by regulation, to extend the remit of the Independent Police Complaints Commission in relation to specified immigration enforcement functions, including the exercise of powers relating to detention. The scope of the IPCC&#146;s remit will be put out to consultation and regulations defining specified functions to be covered by the IPCC will be brought forward at the close of that consultation. Regulations under Section 41 can extend only to functions of immigration officers exercised in or in relation to England and Wales. However, separate parallel arrangements are being developed for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000183"></a>I am satisfied that our proposed oversight arrangements in this area are sufficient. I do not think that the proposed amendments are necessary, as they create a disproportionate regulatory burden whereby regulations can be established in other ways or when legislation is already in place. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The consultation on that question was to be started on 7 May, whereas the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, referred to a public consultation in future, yet to be initiated. I am confused as to whether there are two processes going on regarding the IPCC&#146;s remit or whether the consultation mentioned by the Minister in another place has been postponed from 7 May and is yet to be started. Is it possible for the Minister to clarify whether that process has been started and whether it is a formal consultation in the sense that it would take 16 weeks and be governed by the normal procedures applying to public consultations?</p>

That will be its scope. I hope that that satisfies the noble Lord.</p>

In the timetable announced by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, we shall not even see the draft proposals before the Bill leaves this Chamber, so the parliamentary input to it will be non-existent.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000364"></a> Clause 3, page 2, line 28, leave out &#147;51 weeks&#148; and insert &#147;six months&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000195"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 7 to 12 reduce the maximum term of imprisonment provided for the offences under Clause 3 from 51 weeks to six months. Amendments Nos. 45 to 48 do the same in relation to offences under Clause 21.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000196"></a>Clause 3(1) sets out the offences of absconding from detention under Clause 2, assaulting an immigration officer exercising a power under Clause 2 and obstructing an immigration officer in the exercise of a power under Clause 2. Clause 21 creates a new offence of assaulting an immigration officer. The Bill therefore treats immigration officers in a manner similar to police and customs officers in that they are all the subject of specific provision, in addition to the existing criminal law on assault. The Minister will no doubt explain why this is necessary when, under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, there is already an offence of common assault covering exactly the same conduct.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000197"></a>We recognise that immigration officers, in common with the police and customs officers, undertake difficult duties which can place them in physical

It would be useful if the Minister could explain the thinking behind this clause, which is similar to Section 32 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, although not to the provision regarding assault on a constable in the execution of his or her duty contrary to Section 89(1) of the Police Act 1996, where the penalty is six months. If we are to have a UK borders force, as we were arguing a little while ago, the three groups of workers would be merged into one. Therefore, if there is a need for the special offence of assault, it would apply to all of them and the penalty would be identical for the offence of assaulting any one of them, as it should be.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000198"></a>Section 281 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 allows for the penalty for summary offences to be increased from six months to 51 weeks by order. There is then a whole range of specific offences for which the existing penalties, ranging from one to three months, were replaced by 51 weeks in Schedule 26 to the 2003 Act. In response to an inquiry that I made through the Library a couple of weeks ago, the Ministry of Justice said that it had no plans to bring this section into force. It would have been helpful if the Explanatory Notes had made it clear that, as I assume must be the case, it is planned that all the summary offences in this Bill that are punishable by up to 51 weeks will come into force on the same day as Section 281. I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that that is so.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000199"></a>The Magistrates&#146; Association tells me that Section 281 was drawn up in preparation for the introduction of custody plus under the 2003 Act, which followed the 2002 White Paper, <I>Justice for All</I><I>,</I> and that in all criminal legislation since then, summary offences attract a maximum of 51 weeks, of which the custodial period would be up to 13 weeks and the licence period at least six months. However, as I understand it, custody plus is in cold storage and cannot possibly be implemented safely until the Probation Service has been given a breathing space following the upheavals brought about by the Offender Management Bill, and I should have thought that the provisions of that Bill would take several years to implement satisfactorily. Is it sensible to go on drafting clauses that are not likely to come into effect for such a long time, and is it the intention that immigration officers should have the powers in Clause 2 without any immediate prospect of the enforcement provisions in Clause 3?</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000200"></a>For the time being, with all the offences in this Bill for which the penalty is 51 weeks remaining in abeyance, it would be useful if the Minister could tell the Committee whether a person who assaults an immigration officer exercising the Clause 2 powers would be charged with common assault. Can he also give the Committee details of how many offenders have been brought before the courts on charges of common assault on an immigration officer in, say, each of the past five years, so that we can see how

As the Committee is no doubt aware, the penalty for common assault, or for assaulting a police officer, remains at six months. Whatever else we do in this Bill, my party is committed to ensuring that there is consistency in how front-line public service workers are treated before the law. I beg to move.</p>

We have already seen the bad effects that that has had and now, because of the overcrowding of prisons, it has caused the Government to release prisoners in advance of the due date. On those grounds, I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a very helpful reply.</p>
<h5><a name="07070242000387"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07070242000202"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07070242000466"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Lord&#146;s proposal to limit the maximum period of imprisonment for an offence committed under Clause 3(1) to six months may be motivated by a wide range of concerns. We heard that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is concerned about prison overcrowding, a subject that has caused considerable concern and debate over the past few weeks. Our decision to increase the term of imprisonment for offences punishable on summary conviction from a maximum of six months to a maximum of 51 weeks is not intended to place a further burden on our prisons as a consequence of any routine lengthening of custodial sentences handed out to those who are convicted of the relevant offences. Rather, our principal intention is to provide greater flexibility in the sentences awarded and to allow greater account to be taken of mitigating and aggravating factors when sentencing.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000203"></a>The increase in magistrates&#146; sentencing powers is also needed to enable magistrates&#146; courts to give custody-plus sentences, when they are implemented. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said on that. Ultimately, the Government&#146;s intention is to introduce custody plus and to commence Section 281(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 simultaneously at a future date. A consequence of that twinned approach is that, while the increase in sentencing powers may impact on the penalty imposed on an offender, the maximum period that an offender will spend in custody is likely to be 13 weeks, with the remainder of the sentence served on licence.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000204"></a>The Government&#146;s decision to defer custody plus reflects the prioritisation of prison and probation resources towards more serious offenders. That was made clear in the criminal justice service review, published last July and, in our view, it is absolutely the right approach. Of course, we shall keep the matter of resources for the custody-plus group of offenders under review and look at what else we might do for that group in the interim.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000205"></a>A further reason for our decision is to establish consistency with existing offences against border agency colleagues, to which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, understandably drew attention and with which he was in agreement. The sanctions in Clauses 3 and 21 are consistent with similar offences and  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>penalties against other law enforcement officers, including officers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, as the noble Lord noted.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000206"></a>A key aim of the border management programme is to enhance joint working between the border agencies to bring about a cohesive and integrated border security infrastructure. Creating a different regime of sanctions and penalties for immigration officers to that in place for officers of Revenue and Customs and police constables would be entirely inconsistent with that approach. Furthermore, under the border management programme, it is envisaged that one agency would provide primary capability on behalf of the other agencies at the front line. Therefore, it is vital that immigration officers are afforded the same levels of protection as officers from other border agencies. That is entirely consistent with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that equal protection should be available to public service workers, a point with which the Government agree and I think is quite right.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000207"></a>Immigration officers will be uniformed from the autumn of this year to create a more visible border control presence at UK ports. We want to ensure that we have done everything possible to minimise the risk of uniformed officers being exposed to physical assault and to ensure that immigration officers receive the same level of protection as other uniformed officers of the state. I further underline the point that we need to ensure that we enhance joint working between the various elements of the border agencies.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000208"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked for some statistics. I think he wanted to know how many offences of common assault have been prosecuted. I do not have that data with me, but I shall instruct officials to find the answer. It is a reasonable request and it will be interesting to know the size of the problem. I am sure I have covered all the points, but I am happy to provide as much data and information as background to this as I can.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000209"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07070242000467"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Let me see whether I understood the Minister correctly. The provisions regarding the penalties for assaulting an immigration officer were designed with Section 281 in mind. They will come into effect on the same day as Section 281 and the implementation of custody plus. Section 281 is designed to come in to effect when custody plus is implemented. I do not think that he said that the same applies to the provisions in the Bill, but it was implicit in his remarks. I hope I understood him correctly.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000210"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07070242000468"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Lord understood correctly.</p>

In that case, we face a period in which these penalties will not apply, and that period may be several years because, as the Minister acknowledged, other priorities for the Probation Service&#151;dealing with more serious offences&#151;have led to the indefinite postponement of custody plus so the penalties that are provided in this clause are also postponed indefinitely.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000212"></a>How will assaults on immigration officers be treated in the mean time? Will they continue to be treated as common assault? If so, is there any point in having a different penalty when common assault could be assimilated to the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by providing that the penalty, which is at present six months, should be replaced in that Act by 51 weeks which, as the Minister explained will be divided up when custody plus is initiated into a short period of custodial imprisonment followed by a longer period of probation. If the intention is to continue using common assault for the next couple of years, it is a pity that is not made plain in the Explanatory Notes. There is nothing to lead one to that conclusion in the notes. One reads the Bill, certainly these clauses, in the expectation that the 51 weeks will be coming into operation in the fairly near future. It is clear from what the Minister said that that is not so, and we have a long hiatus before the provisions in this clause or in Clause 21 are brought into effect.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000213"></a>It is generally unsatisfactory to provide in legislation for things that will not happen for some considerable time and that are brought into effect by an order that many never happen. Between now and the date when custody plus is implemented, there may be further thinking on how resources in the Probation Service should best be used. These provisions would never come into existence, and we would be left with the offence of common assault. I also asked the noble Lord why there are specific offences of assaulting a police officer, a customs official or an immigration officer when in all three cases the penalty is the same, and perhaps he will deal with that before we finish with this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000214"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07070242000470"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> It is important that the penalty is the same regardless of whether the description of events varies in some regard. I think the noble Lord now understands where we are, but I shall try to clarify the position. The offence will continue until we introduce custody plus at some point in the future. We are not parking the offence so that no penalties will apply. It will carry on regardless, but at some later point we will introduce custody plus. It is sensible to do so and to ensure that it works well. I hope that clarifies things. If the noble Lord is not satisfied with that, we will come back as part of wrapping up details and with data about the number of assaults, convictions and so on. I shall elucidate further in the correspondence.</p>

In the old days, common assault was punishable by six months&#146; imprisonment, as was assault of a police officer in the execution of his duty. After the 2003 Act, all summary offences enacted from that point onwards were punishable by a sentence of 51 weeks divided, as the Minister has explained. Why have a separate offence of assaulting a police officer, a Customs officer or an immigration official when the penalty is exactly the same as for common assault? Presumably, common assault could be assimilated into the other offences dealt with under the 2003 Act and the penalty for it could be replaced

If the penalty for assaulting whoever, whether it is a member of the public, an immigration official or a customs official, is still going to be 51 weeks, why have a special offence created under this Bill?</p>

The noble Lord understands that and the rest of the Committee will understand it as well, I am sure. Our view is that they ought to receive protection from a specific offence, which is described as equivalent to common assault. I do not think that there is any distinction there. The noble Lord is asking us to create one offence that is then applicable to all three agencies. That is how the legislation has been layered, in terms of the three services, but the noble Lord is right that in the end all three groups of workers will have the same level of penalty applied for an offence that is equivalent. I do not think that there is much between us here. It is just a matter of how we have got to that point. However, I understand the point that the noble Lord is making.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000217"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07070242000473"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I am not going to prolong this discussion, as I am sure that it could be best dealt with offline. However, I am afraid that the Minister has still not dealt with my point. We are not arguing whether these workers should have adequate protection or about the level of that protection; everybody agrees that the 51 weeks, which is applicable to all summary offences, should be the penalty for assaulting an immigration officer, a Customs official or a police officer. There has not been an occasion as far as I am aware, although I may be wrong, when common assault was subjected to the procedure from the Criminal Justice Act 2003 of raising the level of penalties for all summary offences from six months to 51 weeks and dividing in the manner that has been discussed. If a person commits an assault of any public official he can be charged with common assault and the penalty will be 51 weeks. My question was why we should have a specific offence of assaulting one or other of the three agencies operating at the border when at the end of the day, when someone comes before the magistrate, he gets the same penalty as if he were being charged with common assault. However, I do not wish to waste the Committee&#146;s time in discussing that point. It would be best if we dealt with it offline, and I am happy to leave it to the Minister to drop me a note. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000222"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 44. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for adding their names to Amendment No. 13. I am also grateful to the Refugee Children's Consortium, UNICEF UK and ECPAT for their briefing on this matter. I declare a non-pecuniary interest as a trustee of UNICEF UK.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000223"></a>I welcome government Amendment No. 37 as a first step towards resolving the dilemma of how the welfare of children can and must be promoted within the immigration system. The amendment would require the Home Secretary to publish a code of practice on how the Border and Immigration Agency helps to keep children safe from harm and to have regard to the code when carrying out her immigration functions. I note that the code of practice would apply to all parts of the Border and Immigration Agency within the UK&#151;all four nations.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000224"></a>However, I have substantial concerns about the government amendment. Clearly, it does not incorporate the Section 11 duty to promote the welfare of children. That makes it a weaker duty than for other children in England and Wales. The Government's new clause does not confer an explicit statutory safeguarding duty for the BIA on the face of the Bill. It states that the Secretary of State shall issue a code of practice to which the agency should have regard when it exercises its functions. That seems weak. However, I hope that the Committee today will agree that the government amendment should be accepted at this stage, but on the basis that we shall need to amend it further at Report to achieve our objective. I say that because an amendment may be made in Grand Committee only if every single Member present agrees to it.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000225"></a>The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium states that it would welcome the government amendment being accepted today as the basis on which we can then work towards the right outcome over the Summer Recess and at Report. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has three amendments tabled to the government amendment and I give him my support for those.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000226"></a>I believe my amendments, which I still prefer to those of the Government, to be the right solution to how to promote child welfare within the immigration system. I recognise that there is one limitation in my amendment which the Government have overcome by their defective amendment: my amendment does not apply to all four nations. That is something that we shall have to resolve in discussions over the summer.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000227"></a>Amendment No. 13 places a duty on relevant agencies providing services to children to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in discharging their normal functions. The services with primary responsibility for the welfare and support of refugee children and their families, including the Immigration Service, are excluded from the otherwise exhaustive list of those to whom the  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>duty applies in Section 11. I appreciate that the Government have consistently argued that my amendment would restrict the primary function of the Immigration Service. They say that,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000374"></a>&#147;a duty to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children could severely compromise our ability to maintain an effective asylum system and strong immigration control&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/6/04; col. 996.]</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000337"></a>That is the way they usually respond and I suspect that the Minister will do precisely the same again today.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000228"></a>Of course, I do not dispute that the primary function of the Immigration Service is to ensure effective immigration control, and I never have. But other government agencies also have a separate primary function and they are still included in the duty. That does not have a negative impact on their performance: for example, the chief officer of police is included in the duty at Section 11(1)(h). If the police can be regarded as exercising their proper central functions while having regard to the constraint of Section 11, it is hard to understand why immigration bodies should not be able to fulfil their functions while operating under that same constraint. A duty of care is not contradictory to the primary function; it only qualifies the manner in which it is exercised. As the Explanatory Notes to the Act state,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000368"></a>&#147;This duty is intended to ensure that agencies are conscious of the need to safeguard children and promote their welfare in the course of exercising their normal functions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000338"></a>I understand that the Refugee Children's Consortium has taken legal advice which states that Section 11 would not prevent the Home Secretary implementing the removal directions for a child or his or her family and would, at most, just affect the manner in which the removal occurred. That surely should give the Government the opportunity now to give children the protection of Section 11 within the immigration system.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000229"></a>I am in no doubt that the Bill should enhance child safety. The Government have recognised that by tabling their own amendment. It is the right time to extend the duty under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 to those who work within the immigration system, in particular the regional offices of the National Asylum Support Service, the managers of immigration removal centres and the immigration officers at ports of entry to the UK. My proposed new clause would do just that.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000230"></a>Amendment No. 44 finds a different solution. The new clause that it proposes would place a duty on the Border and Immigration Agency to take appropriate steps to ensure that while children are in the UK they are safe from harm and their welfare is promoted. The intention of the amendment is to combine aspects of the duty in Section 11 of the Children Act with the Government&#146;s amendment on safeguarding. It was brought forward with the assistance of the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium, which is trying to assist me in consultations with the Government to find a satisfactory resolution to what at the moment is a disagreement between us.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000231"></a>The omission of the Immigration Service from the Section 11 duty is brought into even sharper focus by the legislative proposals before us. The UK Borders

The Minister will be well aware that the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England described the Immigration Service&#146;s omission from Section 11 as a great disappointment. He also said that he believed that the exclusions were already having an impact on those who are subject to the duty and those who are not. I am aware that discussions have taken place between the children&#146;s champion in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate as it was&#151;now the BIA&#151;and the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England about the way in which the BIA could be made subject to Section 11. I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee today that substantial progress has been made in those discussions and that the Government will be prepared to reconsider further the text of their amendment before Report so that it may more properly safeguard the welfare of children. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000232"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07070242000475"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I support the amendment. It is important that those children receive the protection that it proposes. I was pleased also to see the Minister&#146;s amendment and look forward to learning more about it.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000233"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, set out clearly why the Government need not be so concerned about prolonged delays due to recourse to judicial processes. At Second Reading, I pointed out that concerns about application for judicial review are groundless, given that families already have ample and more effective means to do so through the Human Rights Act. I am sure that it is not the Minister&#146;s intention to suggest that the welfare of those children is less important than that of others in this country, but I fear that if they reject the amendment, that mistaken perception may spread.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000234"></a>I emphasise the importance of the amendment in encouraging the Government and their agencies more carefully to consider and plan for the vulnerabilities of those children and shall use Yarl&#146;s Wood detention centre as an example. When a group of parliamentarians visited the centre last year, members of staff and the Inspector of Prisons expressed concern at the families&#146; lack of information on progress of their case. This ignorance greatly increases the distress of the families and seems hard to justify. I should be grateful if the Minister would write to me with details of how families are being informed of the progress of their cases and being given access to legal support. This is administrative detention; they are being held indefinitely without trial; they need information and advocacy for their protection and peace of mind. The Children's Commissioner highlighted that none of the children whom he met on his visit knew why they were detained. He said to the European Union Committee&#151;I quote from column 2 of page 92 of House of Lords Paper 166:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07070242000369"></a>&#147;The starkest example I can give you is that on that morning, in the reception area, we found a distraught black child, impeccably dressed in his school uniform. I sat down and asked him why he was there. He said: &#145;No one has told me&#146;. I asked him: &#145;What is going to happen to you?&#146; He said: &#145;No one has told me&#146;. I said: &#145;What has happened through the day?&#146; He said that  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that morning he was dressed and ready to go to school. He went to the corner shop to buy a pint of milk and when he came back he saw his house surrounded by policemen and a white van&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000339"></a>With just a little careful thought, much more might have been done to assist children like that boy. Of course, an experience such as that will be traumatic, but the harm could be kept to the minimum.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000235"></a>Perhaps I may give another example. Mr Liam Byrne has recognised that it is inappropriate to keep a few families&#151;it is a few&#151;for long periods of time in detention and Jeremy Oppenheim, the children&#146;s champion, also recognises that. Why did the situation of a few families staying so long ever arise? At a visit last year, a random group of families was gathered by the director. Of the small sample that I spoke to, one mother and her two girls aged 15 and eight had completed five months and another mother with two infants had already spent two months there. Those are but a few examples of failing to consider quite simple matters which impinge strongly on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000236"></a>I share another concern about making those children an exception compared with other children in this country and excluding them from the protection of the Children Act 2004. In, I think, 2001, I visited a children's home in north London. The remarkable manager, who had more than 30 years&#146; experience, expressed her resentment at having to provide beds to a number of Kosovan young men. I was too surprised to challenge her at the time and had no wish to criticise her while she was undertaking such difficult work with the support of staff, some of whom could barely write. Perhaps she felt that, after decades of neglect, social services were just too stretched to take on strangers.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000237"></a>There is no doubt that asylum-seeking children can put an additional strain on a system which still, in many places, is grotesquely underdeveloped for a nation as wealthy as ours. Yet we recognise that such children are vulnerable; they may have been trafficked and may have been traumatised by experiences in their home country or on the journey here or by experiences since their arrival. While they are here, they are among our most vulnerable children and require protection accordingly.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000238"></a>Our social care system and our immigration system face great challenges. Those people on the front line, the social workers and perhaps the case managers, often feel distressed by the nature of their work and under-supported. They risk burning out and losing the emotional capacity to continue to care about the vulnerable children and adults they deal with daily. In that context, it is unhelpful to draw such a clear distinction between children in the immigration and asylum system and other children. There are bona fide reasons to wish to attempt to manage the flow of people into this country. There is also the innate fear of the stranger and the need to hang societal flaws on others which manifest themselves repeatedly over time, most vividly to us in 1930s Germany. Distinguishing these children, giving the appearance that promoting their welfare is less important to us, may encourage those antagonisms or suggest that they should be given a lower priority.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000239"></a>I welcome Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s proposals but as no good reason has been provided to distinguish these children, I hope that they will think again. We should not exclude these children unnecessarily; as far as possible we should make them feel included while they are here and while informing them that they may have to leave.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000240"></a>I also take this opportunity to express my disappointment at Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s decision to keep the option of making failed asylum-seeking families destitute. The prospect of that terrible measure makes manifest the necessity to oblige members of the Border and Immigration Agency to give regard to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000241"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07070242000476"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I was thinking that perhaps it would be better for constructive debate if noble Lords spoke to their amendments first, but I am happy to speak to the government amendment now. I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for the constructive spirit in which she moved her amendment and her general encouragement to the Committee to adopt the Government&#146;s amendment this evening, if only so that it can be further examined and perhaps amended at a later stage in the Bill. That is entirely fair and quite proper. I have recognised for some while that this is an important debate. The Government are committed to doing what we reasonably and practically can to address the issues of concern that have stimulated this series of amendments and debate.</p>
<h5><a name="07070242000389"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000242"></a>My noble friend Lady Scotland made plain at Second Reading that we remain committed to ensuring that the Border and Immigration Agency treats children with whom it comes into contact entirely fairly and properly. The key question is whether that can be achieved only through the imposition of a broad, statutory duty to safeguard and promote their welfare. In looking at Section 11, we were informed in no small part by the longstanding and close interest of noble Lords, as was clearly demonstrated at Second Reading. The outcome of that consideration, as I am sure is plain to the Committee, has been matched by the amendment that we have put before your Lordships this evening, which would place the Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s responsibilities towards children on a statutory footing.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000243"></a>Amendment No. 37 represents a far more positive response and achieves what we would all, I believe, want for children with whom the Border and Immigration Agency has some contact. The duty will not give the Border and Immigration Agency any new functions, nor does it override its existing functions, but it will offer a much more robust assurance that the way it treats children in carrying out its functions is appropriate.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000244"></a>Before I explain how our amendment will help us to keep children safe from harm while they are in the UK, it is important to set out what role the Border and Immigration Agency has towards children. First,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by managing the UK borders effectively and reducing illegal migration, we help to keep children in the UK safe from harm. We must be realistic about what the Border and Immigration Agency can achieve. The Agency&#146;s contact with children is often very brief and the opportunities to identify risks within that timeframe are limited. With 200 million movements in and out of the country in 2006, the task is immense.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000245"></a>Alongside placing our responsibility on a statutory footing, we are developing a framework, the principles of which my honourable friend Liam Byrne announced on 25 June. This framework will cement our links with the agenda set out in the <I>Every Child Matters</I> programme. It will also be tailored to the child protection frameworks of the devolved Administrations. We must also not forget that, more widely, the Children Acts already provide protection for all children in the UK, and that we should not seek to give the Border and Immigration Agency responsibilities which already and properly belong to other agencies. Rather, we need a provision which accurately reflects the nature of the agency&#146;s role, and that is what our amendment provides.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000246"></a>We must also be aware that the Border and Immigration Agency performs this function across the UK, so we need a provision which can apply to its functions throughout the UK&#151;the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, picked up. Our amendment, unlike Section 11 were it to be extended to immigration matters, applies universally. The code will be much more than a general high-level duty. It will set out in some detail the steps that Border and Immigration Agency staff must consider. My noble friend Lady Scotland placed in the House Library last week a paper outlining the proposed content of the code.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000247"></a>The content will be based on three fundamental steps that immigration staff will take. First, to identify signs that a child may be at risk from harm, the code will spell out what these signs are, as indeed some instructions and guidance which the agency has already do.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000248"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07070242000477"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> This is the second time that we have had reference to a document which has been placed in the Library by a Minister and which is immediately relevant to the subject we are discussing in Grand Committee. I repeat my request to the Minister that when he refers to these documents, he or his department should ensure that copies are available in the Grand Committee, and not in the Library. We cannot leave. We cannot get up from here and wander off into the Library to get copies.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000249"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07070242000478"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am entirely sympathetic to the noble Lord&#146;s point. I will endeavour to ensure that copies of documents referred to in the way I have done will be circulated to the Committee. I apologise for any unintended slight, and take the noble Lord&#146;s point very seriously. I am advised that the documents are on the Table.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000250"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07070242000479"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I do not want to increase my noble friend&#146;s difficulties in any way.

I do not think that documents should be tabled on the day of the meeting at all. If work is being done in the department, it would be to the assistance of the Committee, and a constructive and helpful contribution, if these documents could be available at the time when amendments were being drafted.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000251"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07070242000480"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Again, in general terms, that is a valid point. I take the admonition.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000252"></a>Secondly, in response to its suspicions that a child may be at risk of harm, the agency importantly refers the child to the appropriate agency which has a principal statutory responsibility, usually the local authority or the police in an emergency situation. Thirdly, the code will describe the processes and procedures the agency will have which help identify signs that a child may be at risk from harm, and it will describe how a child&#146;s safety will be taken into account in making immigration decisions.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70702-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000253"></a>In respect of the second point, I should emphasise that joined-up working with welfare agencies is already an important part of the agency&#146;s practice and underpins these referral arrangements. For example, dedicated teams of social workers have been established at Dover and at the asylum screening units in Croydon and Liverpool. Similar teams are soon to be in operation at Gatwick and Heathrow. Another example is the excellent relationships which have been established with the children&#146;s services authority in Bedfordshire. This has seen the development of a much more robust series of arrangements, including the secondment of social workers to Yarl&#146;s Wood to ensure that the welfare of children detained there is properly assessed. I hope that that addresses concerns which were raised earlier. More widely, the Border and Immigration Agency is strengthening its engagement with local safeguarding children boards.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000254"></a>The code will also set out the issues relating to the welfare of a child which must be taken into account. In addition to the specific operational instruction, the code will define how Border and Immigration Agency staff who come into regular contact with children in their work are to be trained, and how such staff are safely recruited with appropriate vetting procedures. As I have said, the code will be a detailed document and, in drafting it, we will consult widely. We will also work with important interest groups such as the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services, the new Department for Children, Families and Schools, as well as the Children&#146;s Society and Barnardo&#146;s&#151;which have already expressed their willingness to work with us on the development of the code&#151;the Children&#146;s Commissioner and officials in the devolved Administrations.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000255"></a>While I consider the government amendment to present the best approach to keeping children safe from harm, I can understand why, at first glance, a Section 11 duty appears to be an attractive option. I have also noted that the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Roberts, have sought to amend the Government&#146;s well thought out clause to bring it closer to the duty set out in Section 11. I will spend some time explaining why it is not a duty that would work for the Border and Immigration Agency.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000256"></a>First, it is said that not extending the Section 11 duty to immigration functions would mean that children are unprotected. We do not agree with that; it is incorrect. Section 11 makes no distinction as to the immigration status of children, so other authorities that have a Section 11 duty remain under that duty regardless of a child&#146;s immigration status&#151;for example, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who are looked after by local authorities.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000257"></a>Secondly, we do not think it is appropriate for the Border and Immigration Agency to have a duty which requires it to have regard to,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000375"></a>&#147;ensuring that children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care and undertaking that role so as to enable those children to have optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000340"></a>as the statutory guidance accompanying the duty requires. While the duty is not intended to interfere with the performance of an agency&#146;s primary functions, we are very concerned that the breadth of the duty would beg clarification and invite challenge. The same reasoning applies to the amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Roberts. </p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000258"></a>As I indicated, the breadth of the Section 11 duty would invite challenge. Experience shows that many of those challenges would be made simply as a means of frustrating the implementation of legitimate immigration control and without any net benefit to children. We already experience significant problems with judicial review challenges to enforcement action: we receive on average just under 80 each week, and while on average 88 per cent are rejected as having no merit&#151;100 per cent in the cases of the challenges submitted by families in January to April this year&#151;they cause significant delays of several weeks and sometimes of months. This can be extremely upsetting and contrary, perhaps unintentionally, to the welfare of the children involved. Even if the challenges did not prevent the removal of those not entitled to remain in the United Kingdom, they could add to the already frequent attempts to delay removal or affect other aspects of immigration control functions, such the dispersal of asylum seekers.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000259"></a>Finally, as I mentioned briefly earlier, there is the added disadvantage that the application of Section 11 extends to England only. We need a provision which we can apply to the whole of the UK. Creating a bespoke duty for the Border and Immigration Agency, tailored to its unique functions, makes better sense. Extending Section 11 to Scotland and Northern Ireland would be complicated, as the provision concerns principally those agencies with responsibilities which are devolved and for which separate safeguarding arrangements are being made.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000260"></a>Amendment No. 44, which seeks to impose on the Border and Immigration Agency a duty to ensure that children are,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000376"></a>&#147;safe from harm and their welfare is promoted&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000341"></a>effectively seeks to extend Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 to the Border and Immigration Agency by another means, and for the reasons I have already given for rejecting Section 11, I must resist this amendment.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000261"></a>However, it is perhaps helpful to explain in more detail why the Border and Immigration Agency cannot take on a wider welfare role. The primary function of the Border and Immigration Agency is to protect the UK border by implementing immigration legislation. Critically, this involves determining whether children have a right to remain here. It is on the basis of that right that durable solutions for a child&#146;s future can be made by the agencies principally charged with those responsibilities. In reaching that determination, the agency must, of course, ensure that it looks after children properly, but it cannot assume responsibility for promoting the welfare of children in the longer term.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000262"></a>It is therefore appropriate to define the Agency&#146;s responsibilities towards children in terms of keeping them safe from harm. It is important to be clear what that means, which ultimately the code will make clear in detail. Keeping children safe from harm means keeping them safe from ill-treatment or from the impairment of their health and development. We have chosen this following close consultation with the Department for Education and Science, and it derives from Section 31(9) of the Children Act 1989, in which &#147;development&#148; means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development; &#147;health&#148; means physical or mental health; and &#147;ill treatment&#148; includes sexual abuse and forms of ill treatment which are not physical. The Border and Immigration Agency will not be able to identify all cases of harm because of its limited contact with children, but the code will make clear what signs of harm agency staff could reasonably detect and the consideration it would be required to give when a child is identified as being potentially at risk.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000263"></a>I appreciate that Amendments Nos. 38 and 40 have not been moved, but I shall deal with them in turn.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the Committee would be able to make its judgment in the light of the contributions from both noble Lords. I think from the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that that is what he anticipated.</p>

But we are where we are. I am happy to stop there in my commentary and pick up the points on the amendments to which I was referring after the noble Lord has introduced his amendments.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000271"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07070242000488"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> Before we go any further, perhaps I could recall for the Committee&#146;s benefit that these issues were debated in considerable depth on the previous occasion&#151;namely, when we had long discussions on the previous asylum and immigration Bill, now in force. Of course I welcome the Government&#146;s amendment in this group introducing a code of practice. However, as has been said already, it does not go far enough&#151;because having regard is only a halfway step. I welcome also the involvement in these issues of the Children&#146;s Commissioner. But that in itself, though very good, is insufficient. The commissioner can raise issues of policy but, with his limited staff, he cannot possibly be expected to oversee the implementation all around the country by a whole range of government staff of one kind or another. That is why we need a statutory responsibility to safeguard children and we need best practice everywhere.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000272"></a>Of course, I draw some encouragement from what the Minister said in reply, and I shall study and look at it carefully and analytically. But I doubt that I shall be fully satisfied. I say that because of the extraordinarily vulnerable nature of some of the children whom we discussing, such as trafficked children and unaccompanied children, whether or not they are seeking refugee status. ECPAT, the campaign to end prostitution and pornography, is strongly in favour of Amendment No. 13. Parents and adults may commit all kinds of crimes or immigration offences but it is very rare for children to do so, and I believe that they need special consideration.</p>

I am not fully conscious of the rules of procedure in Grand Committee and I had thought that the normal way in which to approach this would be for the Minister to move his amendment and for him, at a later stage, to respond to the debate. If I am wrong on that, I gladly defer to the Committee. Whatever way we play this, I am sure that the Minister will have a lot to say at the end of the proceedings on the various speeches made to the  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC80"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, as well as the ones that I am about to speak to.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000274"></a>This debate illustrates the fact that it was very wise for the Committee to request the degrouping of Amendment No. 27 from those that we are now considering. Otherwise, there would have been three separate issues for us to consider. There are still two, which makes it more difficult to keep in mind the distinctions between the solutions on offer, as well as tempting noble Lords to make longer speeches than usual.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000275"></a>Amendments Nos. 13 and 44 of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, place new duties on the BIA through Section 11 and in a stand-alone provision respectively. Government Amendment No. 37 and our Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 40 deal with the code of practice. I hope that the Committee will agree that it was correct to ask for separate consideration of Amendment No. 27 which, more fundamentally, extinguishes the Government&#146;s reservation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child so that it would apply to the BIA and would inevitably require changes in existing legislation, some of them on the lines of Amendment No. 13.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000276"></a>Starting with the Section 11 amendment, we note, with the honourable Member in another place Mr Damian Green, that the duty it places on relevant agencies providing services to children to &#147;have regard&#148; to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in discharging their normal functions is plainly and explicitly not absolute. I am pretty certain that in the extensive list of those to whom the duty is applied by Section 11, there will be agencies which have from time to time rightly placed other priorities higher than the welfare of children. For example, the governor of a youth training centre, a local probation board or a youth offending team might have to put the safety of the public at large in a given situation before the welfare of a particular child.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000277"></a>Mr Green went on to say on March 6 that legal advice obtained by the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium was that Section 11 of the 2004 Act did not give rise to a freestanding duty to safeguard or promote a child&#146;s welfare, but qualified the manner in which existing duties and powers can be exercised. I noted that the Minister, Mr Liam Byrne, in replying to that debate, made no comment on what Mr Green had said. It would be useful to have the Minister&#146;s assent to Mr Green&#146;s proposition of some four months ago. The Government have had plenty of time to think about it since then, and should be able to say whether they would accept it.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000278"></a>The question is crucial, because if the RCC&#146;s lawyers are right, it destroys the argument that the BIA would be unable to carry on their statutory duties. What could happen is that, where a child's welfare had been wrongfully disregarded in CRC terms and there was good reason to believe that no regard or manifestly insufficient regard had been paid to safeguarding and promoting the interests of a particular child, a right of action against the BIA or  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its officials would arise. In my view, that would be a good thing. I invite the Minister to agree that it would arise.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000279"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, rightly commented that the omission of the Immigration Service from the Section 11 duty is now being brought into sharper focus by the Bill. One hopes that not many children will be affected by these provisions, particularly the detention and search powers in Clause 2. But as, up to the moment when the Bill comes into effect, only the police could do things of that kind and they have been subject to Section 11, it would be a step backwards if the safeguards are removed.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000280"></a>I now turn to government Amendment No. 37, which offers a code of practice. I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation that he gave and for the document which has now been circulated, although I must observe that it is only the indicative contents of the code of practice, not the code itself. There are still a lot of blanks to be filled in before we have something that we can get our teeth into. A code of practice provides a lesser protection than Section 11, and is even lower in the scale than the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The inaccurate description in the Minister&#146;s letter was repeated this afternoon by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam. He said it is a,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000377"></a>&#147;robust strategy to help ensure that children with whom the Agency&#146;s staff come into contact are kept safe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000342"></a>If it does that, it would do only half of Section 11, which encompasses the welfare of children as well as their safety.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000281"></a>I accept that the wording of the guidance on Section 11 needs to be amended to make it clear that in the particular case of the BIA, there is no obligation to ensure,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000378"></a>&#147;children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07070242000343"></a>beyond the point of their removal from this country, should that become necessary, nor should there be any requirement on the BIA at the point of removal,</p>
<ul><a name="07070242000379"></a>&#147;to enable those children to have optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000282"></a>I also acknowledge that extending Section 11 as a whole to Scotland and Northern Ireland would be inappropriate, as the Minister said, because it principally concerns those agencies with responsibilities which are devolved and for which separate safeguarding arrangements are being made. If Amendment No. 13 were accepted in principle, there would have to be a further amendment on Report extending the application of paragraphs (n) to (p) to Scotland and Northern Ireland, but I am sure that the parliamentary draftsmen would be able to come up with a suitable form of words for that purpose.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000283"></a>With regard to the extra JR challenges to removal that would arise from applying Section 11 to the BIA, to which the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, referred, if there were none, we would indeed be surprised. The figures given were interesting but a little disingenuous. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, repeated the figures given by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland. She said  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC82"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that there was an average of 80 JR challenges to enforcement action a week, of which 88 per cent or 70 are rejected as having no merit, including all the challenges by families in the period January to April 2007. Neither the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, nor the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, gave the number of families or of UASC, and it would be useful to have those figures, if the noble Lord can provide them to the Committee.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000284"></a>The Minister and his colleague omitted to say that on 3 March there was a practice direction, under which the court could entertain an application for JR or for an injunction pending JR only if it was accompanied by full grounds or a full explanation of the reasons for the injunction respectively. I would be grateful if the noble Lord would comment on that. Perhaps he will be able to give us some indication of what has happened since 3 March because the figures that he provided the Committee with extended from January to April and we need them to be broken down from the beginning of the year to 3 March and from 3 March to the end of April to see what happened to the JR applications after the practice direction, issued on 3 March.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000285"></a>The statistics given by the Minister also omitted, very importantly, the JR applications that do not proceed to a hearing because the Home Office cave in beforehand, not wanting an adverse decision to be recorded. We would like that information, if the Minister will provide it, perhaps over the same period. How many JR applications did not proceed to a hearing in March and April this year because the Home Office withdrew, not wanting an adverse decision to be recorded against it? If 10 JR applications a week are allowed to proceed, that must be because there are reasonable doubts about the decision.</p>
<h5><a name="07070242000391"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000286"></a>We all know of cases where, in the end, JR applications are successful. No doubt some JR applications lead to months of delay, as the Minister says, but that is not anything to do with these amendments; it is often a consequence of serious errors in the processes of the appeal system, for which children should not be made the scapegoats. We need to preserve the existing rights of children, bearing in mind the Government&#146;s threatened agenda forcibly to return failed UASC before they turn 18. This proposal has been floated periodically over the past few years and has been strongly opposed by children&#146;s organisations. They particularly fear children as young as 11 being removed to unsafe countries such as DRC, Angola and Vietnam&#151;including children who may have been trafficked, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000287"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, also referred to ECPAT UK, which tells us that it is not convinced that the Government&#146;s proposal for a code of practice will provide the necessary safeguards for trafficked children in particular. As a document circulated to children&#146;s organisations with the Home Office&#146;s press release of 25 June, the principles of the code of practice have been challenged by all the children&#146;s  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC83"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC83</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisations as well as by the Children&#146;s Commissioner for not going far enough to act as a substitute for Section 11 of the Children Act.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000288"></a>It is not clear whether the code of conduct has regard to the commitments the Government have made within the national action plan on human trafficking, including the decision to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Actions Against Trafficking or the new Home Office/DfES supplementary guidance on safeguarding children who may be trafficked, which we understand is due to go out for consultation shortly. These commitments and minimum standards underscore multi-agency working and apply across government, and it seems incongruous to us that one part of the Home Office is raising the standards for the treatment of migrant children while another part, represented by the Minister this afternoon, is struggling hard against being required to work to those same standards. I am afraid these double standards will cause problems, which will be far greater than having to cope with a few JRs, both within the Home Office itself and when the Home Office needs to co-operate with other departments. This is bound to have an adverse impact on the outcomes for children and particularly for children who are trafficked.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000289"></a>If we are forced to be content with the government amendment, we can at least try to make it effective, which was our aim in tabling Amendments Nos. 38 to 40. These amendments suggest that we have regulations instead of a code of practice, so that Parliament can have some minimal say in the matter. Amendment No. 39 adds the promotion of the welfare of children to the duties of the BIA, whether we settle for a code or for regulations, and I have already outlined the reasons for aligning the wording with the statutory duty in the Children Act 2004.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000290"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07070242000490"></a>Lord Judd:</b> When the Joint Committee on Human Rights considered these issues, we heard far too much distressing evidence that asylum-seeking children suffer a lower level of protection in relation to a range of rights compared with other children. In our deliberations, which are there in our report, we consider that one way in which to attempt to address that unequal protection was to extend the duty contained in Section 11 of the Children Act which requires public bodies, as has been argued by noble Lords, to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children when discharging their functions and providing services so that it includes authorities providing support for asylum seekers, the Immigration Service and immigration removal centres.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000291"></a>The committee in its recommendation stressed that the Bill should be amended by the addition of a new clause extending the duty in Section 11 of the Children Act to those providing welfare and support services to asylum seekers, including, as I have just said, the National Asylum Support Service, the Immigration Service and the immigration removal centres. I was strongly identified with that work and with the recommendation. Having listened to what my noble friend the Minister said, I believe that it be would churlish not to say that he has endeavoured to move a long way to meet precisely those anxieties. He  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be commended for that. I sometimes think that an effective form of pressure, although I may not be very good at it all the time, is to encourage people in the logic of the direction which they have set. Rather than always saying, &#147;Oh, but the bottle&#146;s still half-empty&#148;, it is better to say, &#147;The bottle is half-full; now let&#146;s fill it&#148;. In that spirit, the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, were very powerful. It would therefore be a pity if, in the spirit of trying to meet anxieties which the Minister has displayed, he were simply to reject the amendments. They genuinely endeavour to strengthen his resolve and to turn what might be seen historically as aspiration into effective action.

<p><a name="07070242000292"></a>It would be quite wrong in Committee deliberations of this kind to become emotional, but I say with all the conviction that I can muster&#151;and here I speak for myself, but know that I speak for other members of the Committee, as well&#151;that we were appalled by how children became casualties of systems. We were appalled at how the identity, personality and individual needs of children, despite the good intentions&#151;and the sadness of it is that very often the good intent is beyond question&#151;of officials and others, were somehow neglected and looked at as a management problem, to be resolved by finding the right solution at a management level.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000293"></a>I began to think in the middle of it all that what really was needed for a child in this situation&#151;let us think how intimidating and formidable it must be for the child concerned&#151;was a champion for them: somebody whose job it was to make absolutely sure that the child&#146;s interests came above everything else. I also became convinced that, in terms of the obligations which we have in good faith given in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, we have an absolute duty to keep the overriding interests of the individual child central to the operation. We should ask not how we find a solution to a problem, but what will really be best for the child.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000294"></a>A lot of things need to be done to that end, but the noble Baroness and the noble Lord have taken on board&#151;they might perhaps have been a little more forthcoming and generous in their observations&#151;the momentum which the Minister has established. We should build on that. Their amendments could be extremely helpful in securing effective results rather than expressing administrative aspiration.</p>

There is an opportunity here for a reversal of the policy that has been carried on to date. In meeting after meeting, we have discussed the regulations regarding immigration and have contrasted them with the rights of the child in various guises. Although, to some extent, I can understand why, the reply is always, even in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, that the protocol might interfere with our own immigration regulations. It is always the immigration regulations that win.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000296"></a>Many of the amendments have something to do with children. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, who has just spoken, mentioned the paramount need to put children right at the centre of this legislation. This is an opportunity for the Government, who have a new Prime Minister and new Ministers, to take the step and say that the preference must always be for children. We need immigration controls to a certain extent&#151;of course we do&#151;although I am not sure how they would have affected the terrorist efforts of the past two or three days. I do not know how those could have been controlled by any legislation centring on immigration.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000297"></a>I have a fair deal to do with the orphans of parents with AIDS in Africa, where thousands of children are born into hopelessness. This is an opportunity for the Government. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said earlier that there was a move, with Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, to ameliorate some of the harm that it is admitted has been caused by that Act.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000298"></a>I am sure that the subject will arise in this Committee again as we go on to discuss various clauses and amendments. Could we not ask the Government to take a different approach and put the rights of children first? We might need to tweak the immigration controls around them, but let us tell the world that we want to build a world that is fit for children to live in and that this is our contribution. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred to a champion for children. There is one, I am told, but we can be the champions for children in legislation. This is a plea to take that into account when considering the amendments that we are discussing now, of which I prefer the Liberal Democrat amendment. Why do I say that?</p>

<p><a name="07070242000299"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07070242000492"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Lord was doing quite well until that point.</p>

The Minister referred to the problem of applying Section 11 to Northern Ireland and Scotland. However, what strikes me is that Amendment No. 13 falls within the part of the Bill&#151;between Clauses 1 to 4&#151;that does not apply to Scotland. The application of Section 11 is certainly a devolved matter. From what the Minister has been saying, it appears that the Government are perfectly happy that, with regard to all the other provisions of Clauses 1 to 4, it should be left to the Scottish Executive to decide what further powers they need. The mood of the Committee seems to be that the Bill needs to include measures that affect Scotland, and one is left to ask whether the Government have approached the Scottish Executive regarding consideration of a Sewell motion and what response they have had.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000303"></a>Amendments Nos. 38 to 40 reinforce the effect of government Amendment No. 37; what I am going to say is perhaps parallel to them. Will the Government consider appointing legal guardians for those children identified as having been trafficked, and to unaccompanied children arriving in this country generally? I suggest that the appointment of guardians might have a good effect on the most unfortunate phenomenon, which has been going on for a number of years, of children disappearing from care.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000304"></a><b><a name="70702-gc0008.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07070242000496"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> Might the Minister be prepared to meet outside the Committee, before Report, to look at the important and controversial point of what the impact of introducing these children into Section 11 of the Children Act would be? I absolutely sympathise with the Government in wishing to avoid, as far as possible, further judicial delays on a basis which is not well grounded. The Government are absolutely right not to wish children to be further kept in suspense about their future by these sorts of delays. Having thought about this for a long time, my understanding is that the Government&#146;s fears are not well grounded. However, I know that the Government are well advised in this area and have operational experience. If they continue to be concerned, I would want to think again about my position.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000305"></a>To give one example, there are serious concerns about the treatment of children in the custodial secure estate; I cite, for instance, the death of a child, Gareth Myatt, at a secure training centre during restraint. But I am not aware of any occasion since the introduction of the Children Act 2004 when the secure estate has been taken to judicial review under Section 11. I do not see that a weak duty such as this is going to provide significant ammunition for further judicial review and delays in the law. It might be helpful to have a careful consideration and discussion of this before Report, to try to thoroughly understand the true position.</p>

<p><a name="07070242000308"></a>I am grateful for the way in which the Committee has conducted its discussion of these amendments.

We do not  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC87"></a><b>2 July 2007 : Column GC87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>always agree, but we generally come from the same place in terms of the spirit of what we are trying to achieve. By focusing primarily on the welfare of the child, if we all have that at the front of our minds from the outset in this complex debate, we will make some progress.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000309"></a>In fairness to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, I ought to respond to his Amendments Nos. 38 to 40, the point at which I stopped earlier. In essence, those amendments summarise the difference between our positions. If we were to accept those amendments, they would hamstring us in some way. I simply say this about our approach: we are arguing that a code of practice is an acceptable and well established way of setting out how operational services carry out aspects of their functions. Earlier this afternoon we had a debate in which noble Lords opposite were urging the Government to accept a rather more rigorous approach by adopting a code of practice. So I shall borrow the argument that has been made against us in the past and argue that our desire to create a code of practice will achieve a rather more rigorous outcome than some noble Lords would give us credit for. That is why codes of practice exist for PACE and why they have value. I am sure that the Committee understands the import of the PACE codes of practice.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000310"></a>I am intrigued by and interested in the proposition of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about the value and use of guardians. In essence, that is the result of our relationship, and the arrangements that we strike with, social service departments which have a relationship with a particular port or airport and the staff who work there. They get caught up and receive children as a by-product of the enforcement of immigration legislation.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000311"></a>It is hard to define and anticipate every operational eventuality. In our view, regulations that require full compliance would not be appropriate. The code of practice will establish the framework within which border and immigration agency staff take properly into account the need to keep children safe from harm while carrying out their primary function of implementing immigration laws. That is the core of the debate and the essence of what we are all trying to achieve. Seeking to establish this framework as regulations which the agency would be required to observe would undermine the effective performance of its primary functions.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000312"></a>There will, of course, be times when immigration decisions will be effected in order to keep children safe from harm; for example, delaying dispersal so as not to interrupt a child&#146;s education. However, a code would not override the Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s abilities to implement immigration laws. It is therefore not appropriate for agency staff to observe the regulations but, rather, to have regard to a duty while exercising functions in the United Kingdom. Those are the main reasons why we prefer our approach and why we think that it is superior and more flexible in dealing with the range of problems that occur in the enforcement of immigration legislation.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000313"></a>A number of other points were made by noble Lords, and I shall try to run through them in turn. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made the point that we ought to listen very carefully to the children&#146;s champion. We have been in discussion with the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, and those discussions continue. The commissioner&#146;s staff will be involved in developing the proposed code of practice. We want to listen to what they have to say because we recognise the value of their advice and that is why they are there.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000314"></a>I was invited to agree with Damian Green&#146;s observations, but we do not agree with them. The essential issue between the Government and the legal view referred to from the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium is whether Section 11 would lead to further legal attempts to frustrate removals. In our view, it would, and it would not necessarily, certainly not in every instance, be in the best interests of the welfare of the child. I made that point earlier because having a swift outcome can sometimes be to a child&#146;s best interests.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000315"></a>I was also asked whether we have had discussions with our friends in the Scottish Executive on our amendment. We have, and they are content that we are not legislating in a devolved matter. We have not had discussions with them on the question of a Sewel motion. If we were to amend Section 11 and the 2004 Act, we would need further discussions.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000316"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, in a very impassioned plea&#151;I respect the way in which he made that plea&#151;asked for a reversal of the policy. I would argue that we have made a reversal, certainly of earlier policy. I think that we have moved a long way, as my noble friend Lord Judd, was happy to acknowledge.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000317"></a>The important issue of trafficked children was raised. We have been commended for signing up to the Council of Europe convention on trafficking. We have embarked on that course to protect children and we need to set out a programme of action on it. We have been consulting and are taking a wide range of views. We have had quite a lot of discussion in your Lordships&#146; House on the point. The Children&#146;s Commissioner has generally and broadly welcomed our proposals.</p>

<a name="70702-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07070242000318"></a>I argue that we are making progress and think that our code of practice will give full and effective voice to that. We are consulting very carefully on it. I think that one of the most helpful suggestions made in the Committee towards its close was that of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. Of course we will seek to have further discussion on this issue between now and Report. I want us to do that, not least so that we can understand how we can solve the conundrum that our amendment and the other amendments in this group deal with. We have to do that. We need to ensure that we take the best possible measures to prevent harm to children and to protect their safety. As I said, that is a common aspiration. I am happy to have more cross-party discussion on that and to listen to representations. It would be most helpful.</p>

That was why the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, suggested the formulation in Section 11. The Minister said&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07070242000326"></a>We agree on so many things. We agree that child welfare in the immigration system must be at the forefront in all four nations&#151;so my amendment is defective in that respect. We agree that it is important that decisions on children are not delayed. We have to look at the issue of judicial review. We agree that, whatever happens, there has to be a code of practice, and we will need to see whom the Government are consulting on that. We agree that child welfare is vital. What we do not agree on, and what we do have to resolve in our discussions during the summer, is how we arrive at putting children first. I bear in mind precisely what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said: children are the casualty of systems. We have to stop them being the casualty of systems. They are not the ones at fault. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>

The maximum amount of the disabled students allowance (DSA) for non-medical helpers will increase in 2008-09 to &#163;20,000 for full-time undergraduate students and to &#163;15,000 for part-time undergraduate students; the maximum amount of the DSA for postgraduate students will increase to &#163;10,000. All these rates are being incorporated into the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations 2007, which will be laid before Parliament in due course.</p>

<ul><a name="0707023000037"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>Whether they have developed a strategy for the implementation of the combat identification policy and a timetabled plan for developing a credible target identification system; and [HL4325]</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>What assurance they have received from allies involved in the development of joint combat identification solutions that decisions on the system will be taken in a timely manner, with particular reference to the battlefield target identification system; and what financial investment the United Kingdom has made to date in developing the battlefield target identification system; and [HL4326]</p>
</ul>

<ul><a name="0707023000039"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_2"></a>What were the results of Exercise Urgent Quest held in September and October 2005; and what are the implications for the battlefield target identification system. [HL4327]</p>

<p><a name="wa_st_0"></a>
<a name="0707023000009"></a><b><a name="70702w0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0707023000045"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> The department&#146;s combat identification programme includes an implementation strategy. For the target identification element of capability, it is clear that no single system would address all the issues within the priority areas of ground-to-ground and air-to-ground engagements. Together with allies, we have therefore identified a range of potential target identification technologies. Credible target identification systems based on these interoperable technologies will be considered and timetabled plans developed as appropriate for approval at investment decision points.</p>

<a name="70702w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="0707023000010"></a>We are working closely with allies to co-ordinate the fielding of interoperable national combat identification solutions, such as the battlefield target identification system (BTIS). Through NATO, we receive information about allies&#146; plans and we continue to press as necessary for timely decisions, although ultimately each nation&#146;s planning process will determine outcomes.</p>

<a name="70702w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="0707023000011"></a>To date, expenditure of some &#163;11 million is attributable to the UK BTIS programme and associated risk reduction work.</p>

<a name="70702w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="0707023000012"></a>Exercise Urgent Quest in 2005 provided allies with the key information to enable decisions to be made on the selection of solutions for target identification requirements, including the UK&#146;s BTIS programme. Moreover, it identified the technologies that should not be pursued as they were immature or lacked utility.</p>
