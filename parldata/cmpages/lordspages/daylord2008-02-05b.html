Does he accept that it is an affront to democracy if you cannot stand outside your own Parliament with as little as an iced cake saying &#147;Peace&#148; or a T-shirt saying &#147;Free Tibet&#148; without risking arrest? For taking an action such as standing there in a T-shirt you must seek police permission. Will he do his very best to make sure that when the Government review this issue, the law is not harmonised upwards&#151;they are threatening to make all the conditions that apply to marches apply to peaceful protests&#151;but is returned to the position where citizens can protest in front of Parliament peacefully and within the law?</p>

The House of Commons Procedure Committee on sessional orders and resolutions recommended in 2003 that we should introduce appropriate legislation for a number of reasons. That was done, but it became clear that there were complications with it, and the law is not working in the way it should.

It is not a delicate place that everybody can enjoy, but one where the police have a serious problem.</p>

It is a difficult area in the sense that several authorities have responsibility for it, such as the GLA for the grass and other bodies for the pavement and so on. However, what came out clearly in our Green Paper, <I>The Governance of Britain</I>, was that the basis of all our consultation has been to ensure that people&#146;s right to protest is not subject to unnecessary restrictions and with a presumption in favour of freedom of expression. That is absolutely right within the bounds of security and safety.</p>

Changes are coming to Parliament Square which the Mayor of London is considering. I have some experience of the demonstration there. Before I joined the House, I was in full uniform in my car and the demonstrator came up and accused me of being a fascist warmonger. I think I proved that I was a peacemaker because my Royal Marine colour sergeant who was driving me said, &#147;Shall I put him straight, sir?&#148;, and I said, &#147;No, just remain sitting where you are&#148;.</p>

This made many of us feel exceedingly encouraged. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act under which this restriction happened was passed very quickly through the House&#151;there was not a full discussion because the Recess was coming&#151;and many of us felt embarrassed about preventing peaceful demonstrations around Parliament. I am delighted by what the Minister has said. Will he take the view that this matter should be handled as urgently as possible?</p>

We must make this happen as soon as possible. I cannot give timelines at the moment, I am afraid, but we intend to take the matter forward very quickly&#151;certainly within the first part of this year. The measure has not worked properly or well for a number of reasons and some people have strong views about how wrong it is. But there are also practical problems and, therefore, it is right that we should do something to change it. We should all be very grateful for the work done by people in the House to try to make this change.</p>

I am very glad he is doing so. There is a very long history to these kinds of things. The issue is not that you are not allowed to demonstrate but that you have to get permission first. That is not new; it was introduced originally by a Liberal Government just after the First Word War when they prevented people selling newspapers. Then, with the support of a later Conservative Government, the police tried to charge me with selling copies of the miners&#146; newspaper under that Act. Fortunately they never proceeded with it, I am pleased to say, for similar reasons&#151;it was unreasonable. We have to get right the balance between getting permission and carrying it forward. Will my noble friend try to do that?</p>

There are complexities in terms of numbers and so on. As a sailor, it was quite easy for me because, of course, when two or more people are doing something it becomes a mutiny. This relates to fewer than two people, so it was quite understandable.</p>

Does that dignify Parliament?</p>

It looks pretty awful there. The tents have had to move off the grass. As I mentioned, a number of authorities are involved and Westminster City Council is responsible for the pavement. We will be looking at other measures and other ways of dealing with this. It does not look good, it is unsightly, and one wonders whether there is some kind of blockage there. The way to solve this is not as it has been done in the past, and that is why we shall be looking at the issue after consultation.</p>

The EU, the G7 and the international financial institutions remain the most appropriate forums. The Prime Minister met heads of state and government from France, Germany and Italy as well as the head of the European Commission, President Barroso, in London on 29 January to discuss the appropriate international response to the financial markets&#146; turbulence. The G7 Finance Ministers, meeting in Tokyo on 9 February, will take these issues forward.</p>

Does my noble friend accept that, while a consensus is clearly needed to deal with the global problems of the world at the moment, in practice a new crisis may not wait for action to be taken whether by consensus, by legislation or by any other means? The Treasury apparently issued a consultation document the other day, as my noble friend will be aware. In it, powers are proposed for the FSA to take action without necessarily involving legislation. However, does my noble friend accept that the FSA was the only body that did not know what Northern Rock was doing?

It has indicated that it is currently doing a great deal of work to produce a document in March on how it intends to go further. There is no doubt that we need to look at these issues in fundamental terms, which is why we need to engage on the international level. The problems that occurred in Britain are reflective of the problems that have affected the major economies of the whole world.</p>

That is why he met the four key leaders of the leading economies of the European Union and President Barroso last week, and why they are taking those discussions forward. There is no doubt that there has been massive turbulence in the international markets over the past eight months or so, which has shaken them. The noble Baroness seems to indicate that somehow that could be laid at Britain&#146;s door. Where does she think one of the great French banks is at present? What sort of difficulties does she think some of the great American institutions are having?

The noble Lord has only to think of the unemployment levels in some of our major competitor countries to realise the robustness of the British position in coping with what we all recognise is a major challenge to our economy. That is why the Chancellor will go to the meetings with the confidence of presenting to them constructive proposals on how we deal with what we all recognise are fundamental problems. None of us thinks that the solutions to these problems will emerge over the next two to three months. It is clear that the world has to think its way through the shocks to the financial system that have occurred over the past six to eight months, and that some fundamental restructuring is necessary.</p>

I am sure he will appreciate that a great deal of the structural change in the British economy over the past decade has reaped important rewards in performance which marks our economy out as successful when compared with other economies. That does not alter the fact that the shocks to the financial system sustained over the past few months have been on a scale that we have not witnessed for several decades.

Indeed, we had to disarm the organisation to the extent of 2,100 tanks, vehicles and artillery pieces.

This first grouping would remove Parts 4 and 5 of the Bill&#151;that is, the provisions to establish Her Majesty&#146;s Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons and the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Prison Complaints.

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08020540000081"></a>As I indicated at Second Reading, we are aware that concerns have been expressed recently about the degree to which the governance and accountability arrangements set out in the Bill afford these two new statutory office holders a sufficient degree of independence from the Government of the day. Concern has also been expressed about the removal of the remit of these two commissioners from that of the Parliamentary Ombudsman. It is important to put on record that, compared with the existing administrative arrangements, placing these offices on a statutory footing already enshrines a significant degree of independence for the commissioners. The commissioners would be appointed by Her Majesty and only she will be able to remove them from office as a consequence of Addresses in both Houses of Parliament.</p>

In stipulating that the commissioner staff would be provided by the Secretary of State, the Bill adopts a pragmatic approach based on what we consider to be the most efficient way of staffing these offices. Similarly, we consider that the provision of finance and administrative support&#151;for example in relation to the provision of IT systems by the Secretary of State&#151;would avoid any additional administrative burden to the commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08020540000083"></a>Results of consultation in 2004 on the framework for a statutory ombudsman confirmed there was strong support for the removal of the commissioner&#146;s remit from that of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, on the grounds that there should be a clear boundary between the commissioner&#146;s remit and those of other statutory ombudsmen and that there should be no oversight of the commissioner by the Parliamentary Ombudsman. However, removing these provisions from the Bill will allow us time to properly reconsider, in consultation with the relevant parties, what changes may be necessary to address concerns, particularly in the governance and accountability arrangements. In reviewing the measures, we will have to ensure that any changes to the current proposals will also be viable and continue to deliver an efficient, easily accessible service for those potentially vulnerable people covered by the remit of these ombudsmen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08020540000084"></a>We intend to consult relevant parties, which will include the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, the Prisoner Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to agree a time-bound plan for review of the present policy.

We would also expect the outcome of our review to be produced later this year and would hope to have an early opportunity to reintroduce fresh legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08020540000087"></a>That examination found that three aspects needed to be independently inspected: efficiency, propriety and the investigation of grievances. In the event, inspection of efficiency and propriety was accepted as part of the role of the Chief Inspector of Prisons, a post that was made statutory, as it has remained. In 1994, it was agreed that a separate post should be established for the investigation of grievances and the ombudsman was appointed. Ever since, successive ombudsmen have tried to have that post put on to a statutory basis in exactly the same way as the Chief Inspector of Prisons post is, because it came from the same stable. I am unhappy about the fact that we are having yet more delay, on top of 13 years&#146; delay since the appointment of the ombudsman, to the post being put on a statutory basis.

In his evidence to the committee in the other place, the ombudsman suggested that one way of getting over that problem would be to give him status similar to that enjoyed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. I hope that, in conducting this review, the Minister will take account of that and not just go through the motions in looking at what currently exists in the Bill.</p>

However, we should like to put two or three things on the record, in light of the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. It is vital that the person, whatever he or she is called, be visibly independent, particularly in relation to&#151;I know that the Minister has mentioned some of these things&#151;the budget, the staff, the relationship with the Secretary of State, investigatory powers, directions from the Secretary of State vis- -vis investigations and the way in which reports are laid in the public domain.

Evidence from the Minister to the committee at that time confirmed that the Government accepted the need for the post to be on a statutory basis and agreed that that should be accomplished as soon as possible. That was pre-December 2004.</p>

Of the 50 or so clauses that have been taken out, 25 were there at the beginning and 25 were among those brought in on Report in another place that were not discussed, and which are now being removed in this House without further discussion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08020540000100"></a>I underline the sense of urgency on this matter and the importance of the statutory independent basis of this. The Minister will be aware that Bishops have rights of entry into prisons and often have close relations with their local prisons. In our part of the country we have been in the local press with regard to deaths in custody recently, and some important aspects of this issue need to be tackled, not least the fact that those who succeed in taking their own lives in prison are but the tip of the iceberg of the attempts made to do so. I am concerned about the morale of staff in prisons in relation to these matters. That is why the statutory basis should be independent. There needs to be clarity of structure and a proper sense of accountability, so that those who are managing our prisons in their present state of crisis have a sense that they are getting proper public support.</p>

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="08020540000101"></a><b><a name="80205-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08020540000409"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> I think that all your Lordships are agreed that a statutory basis for this post is crucial; but it has to be the right statutory basis. When Lord Gardiner, the then Lord Chancellor spoke in 1967 to your Lordships&#146; House about the establishment of the Parliamentary Ombudsman, he stressed two matters. The first was the ability of the new post to enhance Parliament's capacity to scrutinise the Executive. The second was its capacity to secure remedies for citizens treated unjustly by a public body. More recently, the Council of Europe has emphasised the importance of ombudsmen to the promotion of the rule of law and the protection of human rights.</p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08020540000102"></a>Crucial to those objectives is the independence of the office of ombudsman. The problem is that under the Bill&#146;s provisions, which the Minister now seeks to withdraw, the office is not independent. That is exacerbated by the fact that the citizens over whom the ombudsman will have jurisdiction are incarcerated by the state.</p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08020540000103"></a>There are a number of reasons why the position is not independent. The funding of this new office is to be determined by the Secretary of State, not by a levy on those investigated or by money supplied directly by Parliament. Indeed, the staffing arrangements are subject to the discretion of the Secretary of State. The office holder is to be accountable to the Secretary of State, not directly accountable to Parliament. The office holder will be under a duty to investigate any matter which is the subject of a request by the Secretary of State, who will be able to direct him as to the scope of that task. The annual report is not even being sent

All those matters must be addressed by the Minister during the period that elapses between now and when the Government choose to bring the matter back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08020540000104"></a>I am sure that the Minister will have received, as I have, a letter from Mr Brian Coulter, the Prisoner Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Along with the measures for England and Wales, an additional part deals with Northern Ireland. I shall be most interested to hear from the Minister what he thinks the position will be there. The defects of the position for Northern Ireland are exactly the same as those for England and Wales, but there is an added complication for Northern Ireland, which is the issue of devolution. At some stage, the powers and the office with it will be devolved and consideration will have to be given in Northern Ireland to what kind of arrangements they want there. What can the Minister tell us about that? What forecasts about the timing, context and nature of the devolved arrangements has the Minister made in drafting that part? We are all agreed that it should be statutory, but that is only the beginning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08020540000106"></a>Whatever comments have been made about the current processes and rules under which the ombudsman works, on behalf of the Government, I place on record my admiration for the work of the current ombudsman, who I believe has done an excellent job. As noble Lords said, the Government are as committed as ever to putting this on a statutory basis. I want to make it absolutely clear that we are committed to establishing this office by statute. The question then arises of when we will be able to do so. I cannot give a definite date. However, we regard this as an urgent piece of business to be undertaken. We expect the review outcome to be produced later in the year and then to have an early opportunity to introduce fresh legislation. I cannot go any further than that today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08020540000110"></a>On Northern Ireland, I cannot give the noble Lord a definitive answer. We are considering how best to take this forward in the context of devolution. Our thinking currently is to continue work on it which, if appropriate, could then be transferred to the devolved department of justice. That seems the best way of doing it, in addition to consulting the relevant interests in Northern Ireland. It is a matter that my officials have considered. They are pondering how best to take it forward to most effect. The Northern Ireland ombudsman&#146;s comments were one of the influences in making the decision and played an important role in our asking the House to withdraw the relevant clauses.</p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08020540000111"></a>As for the proposed title, I know that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has never liked it, and we will take note of that. &#147;Commissioner&#148; is a very honourable title. Although we all talk about the Parliamentary Ombudsman, in statute the title of that post holder is &#147;commissioner&#148;. The same applies to the Health Service Commissioner and a number of other ombudsmen. Although I understand what the noble Lord says about management of offending, that is perhaps&#151;to take us back to the Oral Question earlier today&#151;part of the integrated approach that we wish to see. However, regardless of whether it is in statute or is only generally recognised, we want a title in which people will have confidence. I will take that point away too.</p>

We considered that the provisions in the Bill would have assured that independence. However, we have received some comments suggesting that that is not the case. That is why we will reconsider.

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08020540000128"></a>This amendment sets out a statement of principles to go at the beginning of the Bill, which would make it clear to all those working in the system what they were supposed to be doing, and how the Government propose to hold them accountable for compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the Government are a signatory and which Ministers have, therefore, committed themselves to upholding. I am very grateful to the Standing Committee on Youth Justice for the excellent work that it has done on the Bill and for its support for noble Lords in preparing background material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08020540000129"></a>For various reasons, we have seen in the past few years a drift away from the basic principles that should govern a youth justice system and that are the reason why we have a distinctive system which is not the same as the system for adults. Children are not adults; they are still developing and still very vulnerable. It is undeniable that our youth justice system has gradually moved in a direction that takes it a very long way from the mainstream of systems in comparable countries. I hope that recent developments, such as the involvement of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, will start a countervailing movement back to the norm.</p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08020540000130"></a>We have indeed gone a very long way from what is seen as normal in most countries. Our age of criminal responsibility is extraordinarily low. At a meeting chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, in this House on 24 January, we heard that in Denmark, Germany and Spain, the age of criminal responsibility is 15, 14 and 14, respectively. I must declare an interest as that meeting was arranged by the International Centre for Prison Studies at King&#146;s College, where I have a position.</p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08020540000131"></a>The consequence of the practice elsewhere is that, for all children under those ages in those countries, the measures taken are covered not by criminal jurisdiction  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_962"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 962</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but by welfare law. Those countries have various types of government; the approaches are not related at all to Governments of one particular colour or ideology. They are the mainstream, normal way of dealing with children in trouble. I know that increasing the age of criminal responsibility would be difficult because it would be misunderstood as meaning that no action could be taken against children who are under that age, but that is completely wrong. I therefore hope that we shall in due course have a fruitful discussion on proposals to be made by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, to deal with children under 14, where appropriate, in the family court.</p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08020540000132"></a>We in England and Wales are also remarkably out of line in using custody for children, and particularly in using it as punitive custody rather than as custody for care and protection. We were all saddened last year to read the inquest verdicts on two boys who died in custody, one aged 14 and one aged 15. We know that in most similar jurisdictions they would not have been in a place of punitive custody, if they had been locked up at all. They would have been in a place akin to local authority secure accommodation that is part of the system of caring for children and they would not have died. We are out of line in using the criminal process to deal with myriad types of behaviour that are quite common among children and young people, behaviour which they grow out of or which can be dealt with more effectively in other ways. We are way out of line with other jurisdictions. </p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08020540000133"></a>We are also way out of line with our international human rights obligations. The basis of these obligations, and particularly of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, is that children should be protected from harm and given the chance to grow up into healthy adults who contribute to society. The Minister will be aware that last April the Committee on the Rights of the Child issued a general comment&#151;a form of detailed guidance setting out what is expected of countries that have ratified the convention in their juvenile justice systems. The committee sets out its view that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000307"></a>&#147;a minimum age of criminal responsibility below the age of 12 years is considered ... not to be internationally acceptable&#148;.</ul><a name="time_8"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08020540000134"></a>The committee also sets out part of what it means to make the best interests of the child the guiding principle. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08020540000287"></a>&#147;The protection of the best interests of the child means, for instance, that the traditional objectives of criminal justice (repression/retribution) must give way to rehabilitation and restorative justice objectives in dealing with child offenders. This can be done in concert with attention to effective public safety&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000262"></a>I am eager to hear the Minister&#146;s reply to the amendment, because I wonder on what grounds he will resist it. Will he oppose it because the Government wish to take actions that are against the best interests of the child? I doubt it very much. It is clear that making the best interests of the child paramount does not mean that we cannot pay regard to public safety. Clearly it is not in the best interests of a child to be violent to others or to make the lives of everyone in the neighbourhood a misery, but when we take action to stop that, surely we should take actions that help the child to grow up healthy and non-criminal. That is

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08020540000135"></a>Secondly, should we not try to keep children out of the system, and out of custody, as far as possible? Would the Minister not agree with that, too?</p>

<a name="80205-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08020540000136"></a>Thirdly, I cannot imagine that the Minister envisages any situation in which it would not be right to treat a child with humanity and respect for his or her human dignity. I look forward to debating the amendment, and I beg to move.</p>

Do we not need to say in this House and in Parliament that in this nation of ours we have far too many children and young people in custody? Surely the aim of legislation should be to assist us to turn that culture around and move in a new direction. The issue was raised in the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08020540000288"></a>&#147;We note the Government&#146;s statement that it strongly believes that custody for young people should only be used as a last resort. However, we note that in the Government&#146;s response to our predecessor Committee&#146;s recommendation, it said&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000263"></a>and so forth. It continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08020540000289"></a>&#147;As presently drafted, however, there is nothing in the Bill to require that a YRO with ISS be the first resort, before custody, other than in exceptionally serious cases ... In our view, such a requirement would be an important additional safeguard to ensure that custody of children is only used as a last resort&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000264"></a>That is why the amendment raises an issue that the Government need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08020540000138"></a>For a number of years, my wife had professional work in the field of children held in custody. We know that the behaviour of some children and young people is deeply challenging to society. The easy thing to do, dare one say, is to whisk them out of society rather than think of other means of addressing the issues. We also know that custody is the place in which the highest safeguards have to be set out if the interests of children who have been locked away are to be protected.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para1"></a>

In doing so, I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I make a personal observation. We are fortunate to have in our midst someone with the experience of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. She has unrivalled experience in her leadership of Nacro and her work since. I usually sat next to her when we both served on the Joint Committee on Human Rights and she always struck me as one of those people who has learnt so much from life that she goes on learning and responding to what she learns. She often helped the committee to reach its conclusions because of the wise way in which she approached matters. For that reason, it is terribly important to take anything she says in our deliberations very seriously indeed.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_964"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 964</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80205-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08020540000141"></a>I want to make a couple of points. First, either we believe that the principal and overriding objective of our penal system should be rehabilitation, or we do not. Of course the public must be protected, and the way some of the more irresponsible press suggests that if you are emphasising rehabilitation you are somehow not taking the job of protecting the public seriously is really quite iniquitous. Those of us who emphasise rehabilitation take the protection of the public very seriously&#151;not only in the immediate situation but in the long term, which lies in the realm of successful rehabilitation. What disturbs me is that there is a great deal of evidence that children and&#151;dare I say it without diverting too much attention?&#151;young people caught up in the system as it is at the moment begin a life of criminality. The system institutionalises their exclusion from society and their criminalisation. That is not the case for all, but for a very considerable number. That is not only wrong, but stupid because it works against the interests of society and its protection. This amendment is timely in the sense that it gives us an opportunity to think about all this. I say that because for no one is it more important to make rehabilitation a priority than it is for the young.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08020540000142"></a>The second point is that I do not for a moment doubt the good intentions of Ministers to make imprisonment a last resort, as the right reverend Prelate has just said, but I suggest that it is important always in public policy to examine the difference between intention and what actually happens. If we are going to make intention a success, it has to be explicit from the outset and it has to be spelled out whenever the opportunity presents itself over and again.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08020540000143"></a>Perhaps I may conclude with just two anecdotal examples. It can be dangerous to use anecdotal evidence because it can be very untypical, but sometimes such evidence enables us to see more clearly the underlying issues we are facing. I have mentioned the first in Joint Committee and at Second Reading. In my nine years as president of the YMCA, I became particularly interested in the first-rate work it was doing in detention centres and prisons. I do not believe in being only theoretically informed so I went to see this work in several prisons and detention centres. The stories that the staff were telling me over and again of the young people with whom they were dealing, which were beginning to come out in the context of the real and deep relationships that had been formed, were a terrible reflection on society. It was difficult not to come to the conclusion that many of the children caught up in the system were victims themselves. Their anti-social behaviour of course cannot be tolerated&#151;the noble Baroness made this point&#151;because it can create mayhem and absolute hell on earth for some of the communities in which the delinquency takes place. No one wants to sideline that, but it would have been quite extraordinary if they had not started to behave in that way because of the reality of their lives.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08020540000144"></a>My second anecdotal story and my final point relates to a dear friend of my family and a close colleague in my political life, the late Baroness Lester. She was a very close friend of us all in my family and godmother to one of my children, and if I refer to her as &#147;Joan&#148; it brings her alive for me. When Joan was a  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_965"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 965</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Member of Parliament, I remember her coming to our home in an uncharacteristic state of real distress. Joan was experienced in life and not the kind of person normally to get distressed, but she was really in a state. In the context of her responsibilities as a Member of Parliament, she had been to visit one of the children responsible for the appalling and dreadful murder of James Bulger. I shall never forget what she said: &#147;What is so terrible about this situation is that the child involved in the murder has never been loved in his life&#148;. In view of all her work with children, this had become abundantly clear.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08020540000145"></a>Just as I have said that we either believe in rehabilitation or we do not, we either understand that children are children&#151;wherever they are, whatever they have done&#151;or we do not. If we understand that, we need to spell out, not only by exhortations and undertakings but in the detail of our legislation, that they shall at all times be treated as children, and that paramount in our considerations should be the best interests of the child. As the noble Baroness brilliantly put it, by having the best interests of the child in mind one will be serving the best interests of society.</p>

When she says that children are not adults, it goes to the core of the situation. They are not truncated adults; they are a totally different species and, in their own right, deserve to be treated in a wholly specific way.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08020540000147"></a>My submission is that nothing in the amendment would in any way frustrate or embarrass the administration of justice to young people. For example, the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000308"></a>&#147;shall be the paramount consideration&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000265"></a>echo those in Section 1 of the Children Act 1989 that when dealing with young people&#151;and a young person, for that matter&#151;the &#147;paramount consideration&#148; shall be the interests of the child. Regarding the attitude of the courts towards young people, I cannot remember who the learned judge was, but he was a figure of immense distinction, who said, in giving a judgment of the Court of Appeal in a youth case some 30 years ago: &#147;Society has no higher interest than the reformation of a young man&#148;.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08020540000148"></a>There are young men&#151;and indeed children&#151;who are very dangerous and have to be in custody, but they are a small minority. I make no apology for reiterating what I have referred to on more than one occasion in this House over the past few months: we incarcerate more children and young people that any other country in western Europe. I do not have the exact figures with me but I have previously given them to the House. I remember that we incarcerate more than Germany, France, the Netherlands and Norway all put together. It has been said about our rates of incarceration of adults that we are catching more of them, but there can be no question of saying that in this regard. That is not the reason for these figures. The reality of the situation is that we have an attitude that is harsher, less realistic and less humane than those of judges in other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08020540000149"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, raised the question of how high the limit should be with regard to criminal responsibility. I make the point, with some pride, that we already went partly down this path 40 years ago when the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 came into force. There was provision in that Act for the age of criminal responsibility to be raised as high as 14 by Order in Council. Exactly when that was removed I do not know, but I think it was some six or seven years thereafter.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08020540000150"></a>The amendment is practical, humane, intelligent and entirely justified. In essence, it says nothing more than what has already been said by Parliament and the courts in this context.</p>

At the moment we have restorative cautions, which work reasonably well on the whole, but will the proposed youth rehabilitation orders, which we are coming to in the Bill shortly, be able to include restorative provisions? To stimulate the Minister&#146;s imagination, if I can, I tell him that most children most of the time want to be useful. Pretty well all children easily understand what it means to put right the harm or damage that they have done.</p>

I add my voice to theirs, for this is a very important issue for us to discuss at the outset of the Bill. It should help to clarify the overarching principles which inform the shape of the Bill and Government&#146;s vision for the way in which we deal with children who offend in this country.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08020540000153"></a>It was widely commented on all sides of the House at Second Reading that the Bill seemed to lack a theme or any such overarching vision, so this is perhaps the moment to try to tease out what should guide our thinking and practice when we legislate for those children we are so concerned about, in the interests of justice, the children and our society.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08020540000154"></a>The distinction between principles and purposes means that the former are philosophical and the latter more practical, but they are closely intertwined. The Bill refers to purposes but nowhere to principles. It is clear that at every international level where principles are laid down&#151;I have in mind the UNCRC and the Beijing Rules, in particular&#151;the one overriding principle is that the welfare and best interests of the child must be the primary consideration. Indeed, Article 3 of the UNCRC states that it is an obligation.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08020540000155"></a>When the Bill considers the purposes in sentencing, the fact that this principle is not explicitly stated as being at the heart of the youth justice system gives real cause for concern, particularly because so much flows from it in terms of decisions to be made in youth justice and children in trouble. It is a glaring omission. It should not be an add-on, nor a purpose along with others, but the overarching principle.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_967"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 967</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08020540000156"></a>Public attitudes to children are in large measure influenced by our sentencing policy, particularly when we are dealing with children in trouble. We have worked very hard in this country during the past few years on provisions for children and families, and I commend the Government for that. However, something seems to happen when troubled children become children in trouble&#151;and attitudes do change. We then become, through many of the agencies which deal with children and young people, far more punitive, retributive and demonising of young people, which is reflected in particular in our attitudes to policing, sentencing and even schooling in the management of our difficult, disruptive, disturbed and disturbing youngsters. The result is that we are developing a far more alienated, demonised and difficult population of young people, who we then forget are still children like our own.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08020540000157"></a>Children, as has already been affirmed today, must be treated differently from adults. They are so physically, psychologically and experientially. The Beijing Rules require that the juvenile justice system emphasise the well-being of the juvenile. The Children Act 1989 can show us the way, with, for example, the child-in-need assessments, a welfare checklist and a common assessment of each young person. When we talk generally about custody being a sanction of last resort for all offenders, it is even more acutely true for children and must be for the shortest possible time. We will discuss in detail during the passage of the Bill how this is not, in reality, the case in Britain today, but we must start by at least affirming this principle in the Bill. Ultimately, we are talking about a profound shift, not simply in processes and procedures, but in the attitudes of all of us, including the authorities and the courts.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08020540000158"></a>I remind the House once again that, in another part of the United Kingdom, with another legal system, no child prisons exist as they do in England, and children do not enter the criminal justice system until they are 16. In Scotland, we have the children&#146;s hearings systems and the children&#146;s panels, which see and seek to meet the needs of any child in trouble as they address their deeds. Here I declare an interest; I was a children&#146;s panel member for eight years and participated in a system of which we are very proud. There are also some very impressive, welfare-oriented, secure children&#146;s homes, all of which we can learn from. The records in England show that in the STCs&#151;our child prisons&#151;children have died from restraint-related incidents; one has even died in the course of being restrained. These children are, as we constantly remind each other, the most deprived in our society and their reoffending rate is the highest of all.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08020540000159"></a>We have already heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, how shamefully we compare with other countries in our treatment of young offenders; but we do not need comparisons to know that this record is totally unacceptable and is a million miles from treating children</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08020540000160"></a>Finally, I add my concerns about what I call the principle of probity. If we indeed legislate for a real shift from prison to an expansion of community-based

Yet today all the agencies in the community that would be expected to deliver these alternatives, including probation and many other agencies, have been required to cut their current provision&#151;far less expand it&#151;with all the planning, manpower and huge costs that that implies. Can the Government reassure us that all that we are legislating for in the Bill can be delivered and that the balance between prison building and community investment is reversed?

Eight out of 10 children reoffend. We lock up 23 per 100,000; the Finns lock up one-fifth of one child per 100,000. Clear-up rates have been stable since 1995 and 42 per cent fewer people report being victims of crime. However, while 100 under-15s were convicted and sent to prison in 2002, that number has increased to more than 800, only 50 of whom were serious offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08020540000162"></a>What on earth is the point of sending another 650 children to the nick, when it seems to have had no effect whatever on recidivism rates and has made absolutely certain that, of those 650, only 120 will not reoffend. This cannot put the interests of the children at heart but those of tabloid headline writers. Of course one concedes that children can be toerags and disgusting. My late mother said that when I was 15 I entered the &#147;awkward age&#148;&#151;or rather, as she had some pretension, &#147;l&#146;age bte&#148;&#151;and until the day she died aged 75 she never conceded that I had left it. We cannot leave the point that there are little horrors about, but they need more care and attention to try to stop them being little horrors. This should be put in the Bill and with a glad heart, I support my noble friend&#151;I say that advisedly&#151;Lady Stern.</p>

I have been involved with children and courts for a considerable period of my life and know how effective some methods can be&#151;and equally, how totally ineffective others can be. This Bill is an attempt&#151;but a muddled attempt&#151;to begin to make things better and to make it clearer that there could be a range of other activities and diversions. I suggest that what the Bill needs, above all, is an overriding, overarching principle.

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08020540000164"></a>Community-based sentences are clearly the future. We have to admit that legislation passed by this Government has increased the number of people&#151;women, children, men&#151;who have been sent to prison. The system has become far more punitive than necessary and far harsher than the one that worked in the past. One understands the desire of all Governments to appear&#151;and be&#151;effective in preventing violent crime. Community-based sentences will help the Minister and the Government to achieve their aims, which are increasingly rehabilitative and aimed at trying to save so many children who, if worked with properly, can grow up and come out of offending, rather than fall into this horrendous reoffending pattern that we have seen, particularly with young offenders, where something like 96 per cent reoffend within a short period.</p>

It is also a privilege to listen to the wisdom and humanity of the speakers in this House on this important issue. I was very interested that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, mentioned one of the two boys involved in the Bulger case. I also went to see one of these boys and discovered, through talking to the psychologist and psychiatrist who had looked after him through the trial, that, although he was 10 at the time of the incident, his developmental age was four. In order to deal with him, she had to act as if he was four and take toys from her four year-old son to engage him. She said, &#147;I have never stopped wondering how this country could put somebody with a developmental age of four into a High Court situation at the age of 10.&#148; I am very glad that the issue of the age of criminal responsibility has been raised again, because I think that it is a disgrace that this country continues with that particular situation.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08020540000166"></a>I strongly support the amendment because it reflects my experience as Chief Inspector of Prisons. I found that an awful lot of what was put out by government was prepared by officials who had absolutely no experience of what they were talking about and therefore no idea of the principles and standards that they needed to underpin what they said. As Chief Inspector of Prisons, I produced a document, which I called <I>Expectations,</I> setting out precisely what those principles and standards should be for all the prison rules. Having prepared one for adults, we then did another for children and young people, because they were very different. The guide and leader of that process was a remarkable man, who was my deputy at the time. He had governed a young offender institution and, before that, had been the housemaster at a borstal. He said that borstals were positive places, where those sentenced at Her Majesty&#146;s pleasure had to earn their way out and the staff had to help them to do that. He clearly came away with the idea that there was a need for principles to govern the justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08020540000167"></a>We have just been taking the Children and Young Persons Bill through this House. I have been struck by the fact that the contributions to this debate so far are very similar to those on the other Bill, which concerns  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_970"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 970</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>another group of people of the same age going not into custody but into care and preventing them getting involved in the criminal justice system. I could not help wondering why there was a disconnect, with similar people with similar needs being dealt with by different ministries and different Bills. Why is that? It seemed to me symptomatic of this monster Bill, which I can only describe as the &#147;and another thing&#148; Bill because it looks as though everyone has dumped their in-tray into it and added a mass of incoherent subjects. However, if there is one subject that has coherence, it seems to be youth justice.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08020540000168"></a>At the moment, I am also involved in helping a number of people to come up with ideas for an academy. It is an attempt to produce a new style of establishment for young offenders and young people where those who are homeless, those who are sentenced to community work and those sentenced to custody can come together on one site. There will be a custody element with something called a &#147;foyer&#148;, of which there are 100 in the country, dealing with the homeless, and there will also be people from the community so that the young people can be given work, education and other treatment locally on site so that they do not have to go too far.</p>

<a name="80205-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08020540000169"></a>Guiding this academy have been my former deputy&#151;the person whom I mentioned earlier&#151;and another former young offender establishment governor, who said that, before going any further, the principles of the establishment had to be clearly set out. To complement what the noble Baroness has proposed, I should like to read out the core principles that these two experienced people have come up with. They illustrate what is badly needed&#151;coherence in the way that youth justice is administered at present and which is missing from too much in life. The core principles are:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08020540000290"></a>&#147;The achievement of continuity of experience with family and friends, in education, work training and health care ... Connecting effectively with as wide a spectrum as possible of people, agencies and organisations in order to create positive developmental experiences for each young person ... Encouraging dignity and respect in relationships by valuing difference, cultural and spiritual interests and in creating space for self expression ... Offering differential responses and experiences that reflect age, maturity and developmental needs ... Provision of leadership that embraces education and personal challenges to reduce dysfunctional and delinquent behaviour, manages those synergies that most contribute towards fulfilling the purpose of the academy, generates and sustains a narrative of creative expectation and responsible practice, provides a resilient and continuous improvement culture in work and relationships&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000268"></a>Added to the voice of experience and wisdom, which is behind the amendment, I think that the management of youth justice in this country would be better if these principles were clearly laid down for the people who are responsible for producing the legislation.</p>

It tackles the only part of the amendment that I have any trouble with, which is proposed new paragraph (b). Deprivation of liberty has a function&#151;at least to the extent that my noble friend Lord Onslow and I experienced it in our youth. You need to manage the peer group of some of these young men. In particular, a lot of young men look to their peer group for socialisation and for a lot of what they get out of life. They value themselves

If a person has got into the wrong peer group, you need to find some way of breaking that. To put them into a situation where their peer group can be managed is important. If that is to succeed, you then need a way to take that experience and translate it to the lives of these children.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08020540000171"></a>That is one of the main difficulties in having such a sharp divide between custody and life outside. They learn to survive inside; if it is a good place, they may well develop some good habits inside, but all their old mates and all their old ways are waiting for them when they get out. With something graduated, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has just described, there may be a real hope of using custody as a means of breaking a bad cycle with a child and then letting that child back out into their own community in such a way that they can take that learning with them. At least it is worth trying.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08020540000172"></a>It is wonderful to listen to these conversations, but I have great doubts about whether the Government have any real interest in rehabilitation. In the main prison estate, they are expanding numbers and cutting budgets. Where do they think those budget cuts fall? On security? No way. Prison governors are judged by whether people escape or not. The budget cuts are falling on education and time out of cell. Prisoners are spending more and more time in front of television. If daytime television is a way to learn better habits, I do not know what the Government wish us all to become.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08020540000173"></a>An emphasis on rehabilitation takes money, time and effort, which is not what the Government are giving the Prison Service. It would be wonderful to live in a world that is governed by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, but we do not have it at the moment.</p>

He will be aware that the high level of churn in the youth justice system, meaning that children are kept a long way from where they are going to be resettled, makes it difficult to make that transition effectively. As the head of a teaching unit in a secure training centre said to me, &#147;When these children leave here, it is as if they were walking off a cliff&#148;. There is no follow-through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08020540000175"></a>May I ask three questions of the Minister? First, why is there this discrepancy between the practice of child custody in this country and that of our neighbours? Secondly, there have been a number of deaths of children in custody, but there has not been a single death of a child in a local authority secure unit&#151;one of the small local units which have been discussed. If the amendment is redundant and the best interests of the child are already at the forefront of the Government&#146;s mind, why has their policy not been to expand in this area? Is not the Minister concerned that so many 16 and 17 year-olds are kept at 60 young people to a wing, with just three officers managing them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08020540000176"></a>My final question relates to a recent conversation with a German forensic criminologist. I paraphrase, but he said: &#147;We admire the research in the United Kingdom on outcomes for children&#148;. I hear this from

We know in great detail, in a way that continental countries do not, how poorly, I am afraid, our most vulnerable children often perform. He says that he uses the evidence in speaking to legislators and authorities in Germany. He says to them, &#147;Look, the more you imprison people, the more they reoffend. If you use community sentences, they reoffend less&#148;. Is the Minister persuaded by the argument that an overheavy use of custody actually puts the public at more harm, as it encourages recidivism? These matters need to be thought through. I support the drive of the amendment and look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I do not think that anyone in the Committee, least of all the Minister, would dissent from any of these three principles. As the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, that the best interests of the child should be the paramount consideration has been part of our legislation since 1989. The idea that the,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000311"></a>&#147;arrest and deprivation of liberty of a child shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible time&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000269"></a>has appeared in countless official reports and is a standard part of guidance to magistrates and judges. Proposed new paragraph (c) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000312"></a>&#147;the child shall at all times be treated with humanity and respect for his or her inherent human dignity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000270"></a>Well, we are signed up to many international conventions that require us to follow this line.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08020540000178"></a>If this measure were to reach the statute book, its quality might be added to by a provision (d) that dealt with reoffending, a point emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. As my noble friend Lord Onslow said, we incarcerate more children than any other country in western Europe; he might have added that we do so less successfully than any other country in western Europe. At least 75 per cent of children in custody, as all your Lordships know, offend again.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08020540000179"></a>The question is what the real value would be of having such a set of principles on the face of a statute. We all know that these principles are, as principles, binding on the Government. The problem is that the principles are undermined by the details of our legislation on youth offending. The Government&#146;s great mistake has been to attempt to micromanage the judges. However well disposed a judge might be to the principles and however much he might wish to apply them to an individual in front of him, he is stuck with an obligation in an Act, a direction from the Lord Chief Justice or an obligation deriving from some other source to act contrary to the principles.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08020540000180"></a>If these principles are to bite, the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, will need more than she has put in it. It will need an extra provision that allows the judge to override the specific details of the statute by the principles if he or she considers them appropriate in the circumstances. As all your Lordships know, judges can, when considering evidential points in criminal trials, exclude evidence if its prejudicial effect on the trial will outweigh its probative value. If the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, added to her amendment  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_973"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 973</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a similar power that a judge could override a specific statutory provision which went contrary to these principles if he considered that the principles in this case were overriding, that might have some real effect in our system.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08020540000181"></a>Later we shall be dealing with the question of what happens if a youth rehabilitation order is breached. At present there is a certain flexibility that even if an order is breached three times within 12 months, a discretion can still be exercised by the court not to resentence. Often when someone is resentenced, he is sent to custody. What do the Government want to do now? They want to remove that discretion. If there have been three breaches in 12 months the judge is obliged to do it, and more children will end up in custody. Those principles, splendid though they are, will be of no help to the judge unless he can override the details of the legislation.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08020540000182"></a>I am not saying that if the noble Baroness were to introduce an amendment with that kind of force that I would necessarily support it.</p>

But I was feeding her with a thought on which she might like to capitalise later. The issue is about the detail of the Bill. Courts need enough clear water to apply those principles properly and they do not have that. It is not just this Government; previous Governments have been similarly obsessive about refusing to let go of the detail. How can any legislation anticipate a set of circumstances that may confront a judge? That is why the courts need as much discretion as possible. That is true for sentencing generally, but above all it is true for youth sentencing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08020540000186"></a>I welcome the opportunity given to us by the noble Baroness to debate the general principles. She has been ingenious in how she has done it, and it will be helpful to our later discussion. I must reiterate that the Government see custody as a last resort. The reasons in the Bill, particularly in the first part, are entirely consistent with that approach. We believe in rehabilitation&#151;clearly that has to be an incredibly important part of what we seek to do in the youth criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08020540000187"></a>I understand the desire to set out principles at the front of the Bill. That is usually the desire of noble Lords for any Bill on which I have taken part. As it is now nearly 10 years since I first took a Bill through  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_974"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 974</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>your Lordships' House, it is a debate that I have frequently witnessed. I did not agree with the line of argument of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, because I think that there will always be a balance in terms of discretion on sentencing. When we come to the breach question, we will discuss that further, where the Government consider that there needs to be some mandatory action to show people that there is a bite against breaches. However, the noble Lord pointed out one of the problems in putting a set of principles in the Bill without understanding what impact it might have on other legislation where principles are also set out. I know that that sounds like a rather techie detail, but it is an important consideration.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08020540000188"></a>The Government's view is that the principal aim of the youth justice system is set out in Section 37 of the Crime and Disorder Act. The Act imposes duties on anyone involved in youth justice to have regard to that aim. There are issues about how the set of principles proposed by the noble Baroness would fit with that, and with Clause 9, which says that the principal aim of sentencing is the prevention of offending. I have no difficulty whatever in defending that as the rightful aim. We will debate later the question of the best interest of the child. That is clearly vital. There can be no question about that, but there are other factors to be taken into account, such as the interests of victims and the public&#151;not in the pejorative sense, as was used in what was described earlier as media frenzy, but a reasonable view of the public.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08020540000189"></a>I fully understand the concerns about the number of young people in custody. We have also heard from the Committee concerns about particular aspects of experience within custody. I respect those views.</p>

We recognise that there need to be changes. That is what the first part of the Bill is about. We also recognise that we have to do more for those young people who find themselves in custody. There is no argument about that at all. However, we cannot ignore the need to address the concerns of victims and the wider general public to provide assurance that effective action is being taken to prevent and reduce offending by young people. The contrast between debates in your Lordships&#146; House and in another place is interesting. We have to take note of the views of elected Members in many regards, but I reiterate that we see custody as the last resort for young people. It is a requirement that sentencers must already ensure that where custody is imposed it is of the shortest length necessary and commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that we hope that gives discretion to sentencers. None the less, in their capacity, they have passed those custodial sentences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08020540000194"></a>Of course, any child in the youth justice system should be treated with humanity and respect. That is their fundamental human right and it is already enshrined in human rights legislation. Nobody who was a Minister in my department could wish otherwise for the people who are, in a sense, in our care.</p>

The fact is that we think we are consistent with it. We believe that the requirement to use custody as a last resort ensures that the court must not pass a custodial sentence unless the offence or offences are so serious that neither a fine nor a community sentence can be justified.</p>

I am sure he will accept that, some 25 years ago&#151;it may be longer; I cannot remember the exact date&#151;this House passed a criminal justice Bill that ordained, among other things, that imprisonment should never be used save in circumstances where a court certified to the effect that the offence was so serious that no other form of disposal would be justifiable in the circumstances. I think that those are the exact words, though they might not be as it is some years since I retired. As that is the case for imprisonment generally, I have two questions. Is that a thousand miles away from what is proposed in paragraph (b) of the amendment? If it is, would the Government be prepared to insert the general words of the statute to which I referred to apply now to children and young persons as well?</p>

I fully understand the issue. There is no question but that the child&#146;s welfare should be the court&#146;s paramount consideration. Nor can there be any doubt that certain bodies should have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. That is provided for, for instance, in the Children Act 2004. However, the Children Acts were not intended to apply to a criminal court when sentencing a young offender, because we believe that the court also has other considerations such as the protection of the public. That is why we believe that the prevention of offending has to remain the principal aim of the court when sentencing a young person. However, courts do and should continue to have regard to the welfare of a young person, which is where the 1933 Act is so important.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08020540000199"></a>When a court is sentencing a young offender, it never has, and in our view it should not give, the welfare of the child priority over the prevention of offending.</p>

I have already referred to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which deals with the welfare of the child. It is difficult to put a set of principles in the Bill when other pieces of legislation relate to the overall points I have made. I know that this is complicated, and it is sometimes frustrating that not everything is in one place in the legislation. That is probably the very point that the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, seeks to make. New subsection (2) in Clause 9 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08020540000295"></a>&#147;The court must have regard primarily to the principal aim of the youth justice system, that is, to prevent offending&#148;.</p>
</ul>

I believe that the Government deserve credit for the changes that have been made in the past 10 years. We have introduced the Youth Justice Board, which has given a separate focus to youth justice matters, as well as local youth offending teams. Since noble Lords are always happy  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_977"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 977</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to quote organisations&#146; criticisms of our efforts, it is worth noting that the Audit Commission described youth offending teams as,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000313"></a>&#147;a good example of a flexible, multi-disciplinary approach to service delivery from which other public sector partnerships could learn&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000273"></a>I pay tribute to them.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08020540000203"></a>The Youth Justice Board has delivered significant achievements; it has improved victim and community involvement and introduced new programmes to support interventions and court orders such as the intensive surveillance and supervision programme. I think that that is part of what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, wanted in relation to the young men he referred to. We have reduced delays from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders. Again, that is a very important early intervention, which tries to stop offenders from going down the wrong path. We have seen, in the 1998 Act, the introduction of parenting orders which acknowledge the key role played by the family in the development of young people.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08020540000204"></a>Of course we need to do more, and surely the purpose behind the range of court penalties introduced by the youth conditional caution is an example of doing so. We are also seeking to extend the use of youth referral orders by allowing one to be made on a second conviction when the young person concerned pleads guilty and has not had a referral order before. We see that as a very effective community sentence.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08020540000205"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is right to emphasise the importance of restorative justice. I am a committed supporter of restorative justice, particularly for young people. Restorative justice and reparation is a thread running through the youth rehabilitation orders and can be included in the programme&#146;s activity requirement as unpaid work. The reparation order will remain a separate sentence beneath the youth rehabilitation order. We will also be piloting a new out-of-court disposal&#151;a youth restorative disposal which will also be below the YRO but allow a young person to apologise for committing an offence and to take responsibility for their actions.</p>

<a name="80205-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08020540000206"></a>We will debate in detail the construct of youth rehabilitation orders. There is no doubt that preventing offending in the first place is the best way of tackling youth offending. Preventing young people entering the criminal justice system has to be the cornerstone of the Government&#146;s youth crime strategy. The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, asked me about the joint responsibility between my department and the Department for Children, Schools and Families&#151;a very helpful development in government responsibilities. We are still at the early stages of making it work effectively but I have no doubt that it is a very important change. I hope it leads to ensuring that children&#146;s services generally are co-ordinated and that the youth justice system works much more effectively.</p>

We are concerned about the number of young people currently in custody. When young people are in custody, we want to ensure that the emphasis is very much on the prevention of reoffending and on rehabilitation. We have seen improvements in some of the educational programmes, but we need to do more. We have to ensure that when a young person leaves a custodial setting there is proper liaison and integration with services back in the community. That is why the link with the Department for Children is so important. At the same time, we believe that we have got the principles of the system right, with the emphasis on reoffending. I have no doubt that we will come back to this as we go through the Bill, and at a later stage. At this stage, I thank noble Lords for a very helpful debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08020540000215"></a>It is quite clear to all Members of the Committee that the philosophy that lies behind the youth rehabilitation order is to establish a generic order. The Joint Committee on Human Rights welcomed in principle the idea of a generic community sentence, which, it says,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000314"></a>&#147;has the potential to enhance the legal protection for the human rights of children and young people in the criminal justice system&#148;.</ul>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08020540000216"></a>The youth rehabilitation order encompasses lots of previous low, medium and high-effect orders in a single unit. I am therefore perplexed by the Government&#146;s decision to keep reparation orders out of this hierarchy. The Government&#146;s argument behind the generic principle is that, for example, intensive supervision and surveillance orders should be part of a single generic order, and that there is an inbuilt hierarchy in the generic youth rehabilitation orders. Therefore, why do they want to keep the reparation order separate? If we are to move towards a generic philosophy, it is vital that it is all encompassing.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08020540000217"></a>The right honourable Mr Hanson, the Minister in another place, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08020540000297"></a>&#147;We are trying to ensure that we have the flexibility of having the reparation order in place for low-level offences and, equally, including it as part of a wider youth rehabilitation order if need be. It is important that we do that to prevent reoffending&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill Committee, 23/10/07; col. 215.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000274"></a>But the menu of options set out in the Government&#146;s list contains many low-level interventions that magistrates can use, and it is not clear how one can distinguish a hierarchy of measures, such as a limited attendance centre requirement or a limited activity requirement, and a reparation order. That is particularly true if the Government&#146;s position is that intensive supervision and surveillance orders fall within generic youth rehabilitation orders. By implication, if I understand the Government aright, there is a hierarchy starting at the bottom and moving right up the scale to intensive supervision and surveillance orders. Surely it makes sense to have all the options available in a clear and methodical manner.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08020540000218"></a>The points raised by the other two amendments are slightly different. They concern restorative justice, and I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, is not in his place&#151;he has left the Chamber just at the crucial moment. One thing we know about restorative justice, or at least what we know from the experience we have had with it so far, is that it has been successful. The intervention works in what are often surprising ways. For example, it works not just for property crime, which is what people normally think of with restorative justice, but it also works for some sorts of violent crime. Moreover, it is capable on many occasions of helping the victim who has been the subject of a crime. My concern is that in practice some of the reparation orders do not go as far as they should, which is properly to address the issues of the offence with the victim. Quite often it simply means that there is an obligation on the offender to write a letter to the victim and do no more. That is the purpose behind the provision in Amendment No. 22 of a definition of what the reparation requirement should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08020540000219"></a>Amendment No. 64, which is an amendment to Schedule 1, defines the reparation requirement in relation to a youth rehabilitation order as meaning,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000315"></a>&#147;a requirement that during the period for which the order remains in force, the offender must attend an activity or activities involving contact between an offender and persons affected by offences in respect of which the order was made and as may be determined by the responsible officer&#148;.</ul>

I shall deal first with Amendment No. 2, which follows closely an amendment debated in Committee in another place. We believe that adequate provision is already made in the Bill and in existing law for reparation by the offender. It is our view and, I think, will be that of the Committee generally, that young people who have offended should accept responsibility for their actions. As part of this, where possible and depending on the nature and circumstances of the offence, the offender should be required to do something practical in reparation that will benefit the victim or alternatively the community as a whole. Offenders can be required to do things such as cleaning up graffiti, repairing community facilities or conservation work.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08020540000221"></a>Making reparation to the victim of a crime is a central part of the youth justice system because it can assist with the rehabilitation of the offender and help the victim. That is precisely why we have made provision for reparation in the requirements of the youth rehabilitation order. Paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 1 to the Bill provides that as part of an activity requirement, a specified activity,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000316"></a>&#147;may consist of an activity ... whose purpose is that of reparation, such as an activity involving contact between an offender and persons affected&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000276"></a>by the crime. Indeed, the Committee will have noticed the similarity between the words in paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 1 and the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08020540000222"></a>But what of the suggestion that reparation cannot be made available with other requirements? First, an activity requirement will always form part of the youth rehabilitation order, with intensive supervision and surveillance. It could feature as part of a programme requirement or, in the broader sense, take the form of an unpaid work requirement. Secondly, if reparation was wanted in addition to some other requirement, the court could impose an activity requirement the sole purpose of which is reparation.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08020540000223"></a>Let me explain why we propose to retain the reparation order as a separate sentence beneath the youth rehabilitation order. It is to give the courts flexibility so that they do not have to resort to a youth rehabilitation order simply to ensure that reparation is made. During oral evidence to the Public Bill Committee in the other place, both the Youth Justice Board and the Children&#146;s Society strongly supported retaining the reparation order as a separate sentence. The chief executive of the Youth Justice Board told the committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020540000317"></a>&#147;there is value in having reparation in its own right&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill Committee, 18/10/07; col. 109.]</ul>
<a name="80205-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08020540000224"></a>A reparation order provides a separate sentence below the youth rehabilitation order in the sentencing hierarchy. Like reparation as part of a youth rehabilitation order, it is designed to reinforce personal responsibility and learning about the consequences of the damage the offender has caused to the individual and the community. We believe that the reparation order can be effective in preventing the escalation of offending behaviour before there is a need for the court to consider a youth rehabilitation order and, as such,  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_981"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 981</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be retained as a free-standing disposal in its own right. I remind the Committee of what I am sure it knows well, that it can typically be combined with a fine.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08020540000225"></a>As the amendments are drafted, the new reparation requirement would duplicate the provisions for reparation already built into the youth rehabilitation order, and I have referred to the part of Schedule 1 in which this appears. The amendments are not necessary in our view and do not go as far as the provisions already in the Bill. They risk causing some confusion to the courts, to the supervising authorities and, crucially, to the young person who is to be sentenced. For those reasons, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08020540000226"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s other amendments, reparation is a form of restorative justice. The youth rehabilitation order includes provision for reparation and therefore covers those amendments.</p>

Of course not; a reparation order is a part of the sentence of the court, as I understand it, for someone who has been convicted or pleaded guilty to a criminal offence. It cannot be imposed just because the court feels like it.</p>

To be found guilty of an offence very often makes the child more likely to reoffend, not less likely. We all know what children are like and, if they are found guilty, very often they come back and do it again. That is our experience of children and a lasting experience in the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08020540000230"></a>Many years ago I was on the visiting committee of a borstal. Borstals had very high aims and did a lot of very good youth work while people were in them, but the reoffending rate was enormous; only 11 per cent at that time did not reoffend. It simply did not work. I learnt at that time that to be found guilty does not necessarily make you less likely to offend again.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08020540000231"></a>The menu of possibilities that the court may impose under the Bill contains many measures that one would hope might be taken regarding a child without them being found guilty of an offence&#151;but in this context they are guilty of an offence. There is a basic problem in how to meet the Government&#146;s aspirations through the order. The reparation motion is excellent and works better than most things, but again it applies only because you are guilty of an offence and you have to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08020540000232"></a>In thinking about all this, we have to realise that unless we can find a way of getting children to do some of these things without being found guilty of an offence, we will not get terribly far.

She asked about reparation orders under Clause 1. As always, in my experience, she has a point. Youth conditional cautions are provided for in the Bill, and they are part of a pre-court disposal. In effect, as I understand it, the offender has admitted the offence and the discretion is used not to bring him or her before a court but to caution them. As part of the youth conditional caution, and this should please the noble Baroness to some extent, there can be an element of reparation or restorative justice. I hope that clarifies the issue. I have been addressing the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about reparation in the context of the Bill.</p>

<a name="08020540000234"></a><b><a name="80205-0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08020540000453"></a>Baroness Linklater of Butterstone:</b> I have great sympathy with the amendment. I read from around the House that there is a lot of support for both reparation and what the discussion has then slipped into, which is restorative justice. In order to retain clarity, it is important to realise that there is a real distinction between reparation and restorative practices, not least when, as happens quite often, victims are not at all keen on meeting the person who has offended against them. Restorative conferences require a great deal of work to be done with both the victim and the offender. I have had the good luck to be able to sit in on one or two restorative conferences and they are extraordinarily interesting and helpful, but they are not necessarily applicable in all cases. A lot of work has to be done. They are part of a continuum but they are definitely distinct and separate. I understand the Government&#146;s position on keeping reparation separate because it has a role, but it is none the less part of a continuum of possibilities that should be available to the courts. There should be no confusion between the two.</p>

He suggested that one of the influences on the Government in taking this step was advice that had been proffered from outside. However, the Government will have had advice also from the magistrates, who have suggested that it would have been much better if reparation had been expressly included in Clause 1(1), as I have argued.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08020540000236"></a>The Minister, like the right honourable Mr Hanson in another place, placed great emphasis on the reparation order being a low-level intervention. However, there are many other low-level interventions which are an inherent part of Clause 1(1). One can think, for example, of a limited attendance centre requirement or a limited activity requirement, which are just as low-level as a reparation requirement. What distinguishes them from the reparation requirement? What makes it appropriate for them to be incorporated, in circumstances where the reparation requirement is not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08020540000243"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment raises intensive fostering, which is not to be confused with the normal fostering obligations that lie on a local authority for general welfare purposes. The evidence we have so far suggests that intensive fostering has great potential to keep a child out of custody, but does that only when it is properly implemented. The Government have pilot projects in, I think, three counties, the results of which are being analysed by the University of York. So far, the results are extremely encouraging. The real issue is the cost, because although intensive fostering is potentially very successful, it is extremely resource-consuming and therefore very expensive. What is more, the expense falls not on the criminal justice system and its budget, but on the local authority in the area where the child is located.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08020540000244"></a>When this matter was debated in another place the Minister, Mr Hanson, suggested that local authorities would have to bear no less than, on average, some &#163;500,000 per county. Where is this money going to come from? Will it be diverted from the criminal justice system or will the resources devoted to other community orders be stretched further? It appears that a court cannot impose a fostering requirement without consulting the local authority, so there will be a financial incentive for the local authority to say that they are not in a position to provide intensive fostering facilities. The consequence might well be that the child will end up in custody.</p>

<a name="80205-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08020540000245"></a>So a financial issue is at the heart of this potentially extremely successful arm of youth justice. I expect that between the stages of the Bill in another place and now the Government have not advanced very much in their thinking about how they will finance this, but they must surely see the dilemma here; clearly some local authorities, either because they are relatively wealthy or because they really believe in intensive fostering, are more likely than not to provide facilities and other counties will not. You might end up with a kind of postcode regime for this measure. In our submission, it would be a very great shame if that were to be its fate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08020540000246"></a>Through the amendment I am urging the Government in approaching this issue to think a little more carefully and imaginatively than they have felt themselves capable of so far. I beg to move.</p>

This is a proposal called the VYOI&#151;the Virtual Young Offenders Institute&#151;which has been funded by the Treasury to the tune of &#163;3 million for three years; this is the third year. It entails young offenders whose criminality is not deemed so great being given the opportunity of living with and being intensively fostered by a foster parent appointed by Community Service Volunteers. The offenders are given employment and education and they are helped into accommodation when their period is over. Of course, if they fail in any way to come up to the terms of the scheme, they are sent back to custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08020540000248"></a>The interesting thing about this experiment was that it took an enormously long time for Community Service Volunteers, having got funding from the Treasury, and supported in its appeal for it by the then chief executive of NOMS, to persuade the Probation Service and others to release these young offenders into intensive fostering, because they claimed that the offenders were their responsibility. What is happening now is that the work is in progress, overseen by the regional offender manager in the north-east, and an evaluation of this project, funded by the Helen Hamlyn Trust, is being carried out by Newcastle University. Here I declare an interest, because I am an adviser to the Helen Hamlyn Trust and suggested that it should fund this evaluation. It would be worth the Minister monitoring this, because it is something practical that has potential and there are evaluated results that can be taken into account.</p>

If the evidence is there, as it seems to be on a small scale, the argument can be made that the extremely high costs referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, could be justified in the long term. However, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also makes the point that I made in our earlier debate; namely, that unless the facilities are available for a particular disposal to be carried out, it is pointless to make this disposal. This is one of the only instances in the Bill where it has to be established before a disposal is made that intensive fostering facilities are available. I urge the Government to reassure us constantly that if a decision is made on a community-based penalty, both the resources and the facilities will be there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08020540000251"></a>The scheme is based on the Youth Justice Board&#146;s intensive fostering pilot, which offers an innovative alternative to custody. Let me repeat&#151;this is an alternative to custody and is pitched at this level as a reflection of its intensity. The fostering requirement retains its place as an alternative to custody alongside intensive supervision and surveillance. The Committee will know that intensive

Intensive fostering works on an evidence-based model, delivered by a team who work directly with the young person and, critically, with their family of origin. I repeat that it is an alternative to custody, for use where the juvenile&#146;s offending is directly linked to their home environment. It is designed to provide highly intensive care for the offender for up to 12 months, as well as a programme of support for the family. This structured intensive fostering programme of daily activity is clearly distinguished from standard foster placements, and its intensity underlines its position at the custody threshold.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08020540000252"></a>The Youth Justice Board emphasised the value of intensive fostering in its evidence to the Commons Committee, stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="08020540000300"></a>&#147;It is also welcome that the YRO will include a fostering requirement as another clear alternative to custody allowing for use of the Intensive Fostering programme currently being piloted by the Youth Justice Board ... Intensive fostering is being piloted on a small scale as an alternative to custody in cases where a young person&#146;s offending is directly linked to his or her home environment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000277"></a>Those places where it is being trialled are Stafford, Wessex&#151;which is Hampshire and the Isle of Wight&#151;and parts of east London. The programme is designed to provide highly intensive care for the child or young person for up to 12 months, as well as a programme of support for the wider family. This structured intensive fostering programme of daily activity is clearly distinguishable from ordinary fostering. Currently the programme is available on a small scale&#151;so far 35 young people have taken part. The pilot is due to end in October 2008. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested in moving his amendment, while evaluation of the scheme is not complete, initial indications are positive, although we have to put in the caveat that only a small number of people have been through it.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08020540000253"></a>The noble Lord properly raises the issue of money and resources. The first thing to say is that we do not think that this scheme will involve a large number of children, even when it is up and running. It is a vital tool in the kit of those who, like this Committee, want to keep young people out of custody. But we do not think it will be widely used and, as far as resources are concerned, let me quote from Mr Les Lawrence, the chairman of the children and young persons panel from the Local Government Association, who gave evidence to the Public Bill Committee on 18 October 2007. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08020540000301"></a>&#147;The early indication is that the number of places and the resources, working with the court and the other agencies, are sufficient at this point, as is the number of places that are required to match the number of available resources. Yes, there is support from local authorities, because of the other services that need to go with the fostering service, but thus far, albeit from early indications from that pilot, it seems that the resources&#151;if used in an aligned and the proper way&#151;are sufficient at present&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill Committee, 18/10/07; col. 141.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020540000278"></a>So far, so good. The noble Lord is quite right, when considering a programme that I think will have the universal support of Members of the Committee, to ask how it will develop in future. He can rest assured

<ul><a name="08020549000066"></a>&#147;deeply concerned at the ... increasing numbers of children in custody, at earlier ages for lesser offences, and for longer custodial sentence imposed by the recent increased court powers to give detention and training orders.

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08020549000004"></a>I underline the fact that this was in 2002 because in 2003 approximately 1,400 children under the age of 18 were in custody in England and Wales. That number more than doubled over five years, with a 110 per cent increase, from 1,405 in 2002 to 3,000. The number of children under the age of 15 in custody has increased even more dramatically&#151;by 700 per cent, as I explained earlier&#151;from 100 to more than 800, with only 50 being serious cases. That increase has been driven by government legislation and the sentencing climate. Over the same period, indictable offences have dropped by 20 per cent, and that is no artificial change. The rates have been stable since 1995 and 42 per cent fewer people report being crime victims. I also said earlier that the figures for this country were 23 per 100,000 and, for the Finns, 0.02. Just for fun, I shall put France down as six and Spain at two. That shows that something has gone wrong in the use of custody thresholds and we think that that needs to be addressed seriously.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08020549000005"></a>Everyone agrees that children can be very unpleasant on occasion, and we have recently read in the newspapers of sentences for children who behave in a very repellent manner, but it is more important than anything else to get at those children. One does not defend the public by getting at those children, but one does defend the public and act for the good of public safety by ensuring that proper rehabilitation of the disgusting, as well as of the less disgusting, is carried out. I think we are all saying that the use of custody is just not working and, if it does not work, that is immoral. Therefore, we should ensure that everything else is tried before custody is used and that should be in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I thought that he moved it in a characteristically reflective style, which is always very enjoyable to hear. He referred in passing to left-wing advocates. I served on the committee with the noble Earl for some time and often felt that he was essentially, in the best sense, a left-wing advocate of decency, humanity and common sense. However, that is not why I rise to support the amendment, although I am glad to do so in that spirit. He referred to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, but when the human rights commissioner from the Council of Europe visited this country, he had an informal meeting with the members of the committee and was really perturbed by what he detected&#151;I think it may be fair to say that he thought it was inadvertent&#151;as the increasing criminalisation of young people in our

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08020549000007"></a>The second reason is that, with the help of the Home Office&#151;I always believe in looking at things as they are&#151;I visited one of the teams working on the front line in this sphere. I do not think that I am doing them a disfavour if I say that I was terribly impressed by their unhappiness about the way the system was operating; they were quite perturbed about it. I think that it is something that needs to be addressed and, for those reasons, I hope that my noble friend, who is a reasonable man, will respond to the amendment reasonably and sensitively.</p>

She had been a social worker and a children&#146;s officer, and she used her time in this House to enormous effect in bettering the lot of disadvantaged children&#151;particularly those in trouble. In this House, she introduced an amendment which became Section 1(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 and which set a custody threshold for people under 21 before it was repealed by Section 101(2) and Schedule 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Her Section 1(4) provided that the courts should not pass a sentence of custody on a person under 21 unless they were,</p>
<ul><a name="08020549000068"></a>&#147;of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate because it appears to the Court that he is unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties or because a custodial sentence is necessary for the protection of the public or because the offence was so serious that a non-custodial sentence cannot be justified&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80205-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08020549000011"></a>The measure had a significant effect on the number of young people sent to custody. Between 1982 and 1990, there was a 54 per cent reduction in the use of immediate custody for indictable offences for people under 21. The clause was opposed by the then Conservative Government and was achieved only after a considerable amount of persuasion by Baroness Faithfull, which she was extremely good at. The Government subsequently admitted, however, that she had been proved right by events. There are sound human rights arguments for reserving custody for children to the inescapable minimum, for trying all other measures first and for imposing a high seriousness threshold. I cannot believe that that is what we are doing at the moment.</p>

The arguments I heard for why he did not keep his appointments were certainly worthy of examination.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08020549000013"></a>We have the latest custody figures from the Ministry of Justice, from December 2007. They show that 387 of the 1,781 sentenced children aged 15 to 17 received a sentence of six months or less. Such a sentence cannot have been imposed for public protection reasons or for seriousness, so why was it imposed? Of the 1,781, 143 were imprisoned for theft and handling, 79 for drug offences, 35 for motor vehicle offences and 216 for other non-violent offences. I therefore find the Government&#146;s position a little hard to understand. They frequently say&#151;the Minister said it again today&#151;that they want custody used as a last resort. I have no doubt that he is absolutely sincere or that that is what he wants.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08020549000014"></a>The Youth Justice Board has a target to reduce the use of custody by 10 per cent&#151;not that the Youth Justice Board can reduce the use of custody. Presumably it means that it requires the youth offending team workers to try much harder to put good ideas for non-custodial options to the courts and to persuade them of the merits of such a course. If the Youth Justice Board has such an objective, surely the Government support it? Custody is very expensive. It is very damaging to a child&#146;s prospects. As the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, even an admission of guilt and a conviction is very damaging to a child&#146;s prospects. The research from the University of Edinburgh child cohort study makes it clear that the most likely predictor of future involvement in crime is an initial involvement in the criminal justice system. Most other countries in Europe manage not to use custody as we do. The Government may like to take particular note of the view of the Local Government Association, which we have just heard quoted on this matter. It has written to many of us urging our support for an amendment such as this one. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="08020549000061"></a>&#147;We do hear of horrific acts of violence perpetrated by young people, and for young people who commit such offences a custodial sentence must, of course, remain an option. However, there are a great many young people drawn into the youth justice system who do not represent a serious risk to the physical or mental health of others and are actually vulnerable themselves. We must respond to those young people as children first, seeking to address their welfare needs whilst seeing that justice is done&#151;but does not jeopardise the child&#146;s future, long-term health and well-being&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020549000062"></a>This is the crux of its argument:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08020549000063"></a>&#147;We are convinced that a failure to take such an approach will ultimately be borne by the local community.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80205-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08020549000064"></a>The Local Government Association is making the point that local communities will have to bear the consequences of this policy. Young people who are sent to prison for six months for non-violent offences will come back, but their prospects will be worse. They will cost their local community a lot. They may well cause a great deal of damage. Those are very strong practical reasons which I hope the Government will consider when looking at these amendments.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08020549000018"></a>It is a sad reflection on the reality of our management of children who are currently in trouble and offending that these amendments are necessary at all. The amendments are designed to ensure that custody is used only as a last resort for children&#151;when in theory, of course, there is already a requirement that it be the last resort for offenders of all ages except the most dangerous and prolific. We know that that is not the case for adults. Shockingly, it is not true in the case of children either. In the past 10 years, children have increasingly been sent to custody not only for lesser offences but for longer periods, thus violating Article 37(b) of the CRC.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08020549000019"></a>The reality is that the number of children in custody has more than doubled in 15 years, increasing by 110 per cent, so that approximately 3,000 are now in custody. The number of children under 15 in custody has increased by more than 700 per cent. I wish that the noble Lord on the Tory Front Bench would listen; these are terribly important points. The number of children under 15 in custody has increased from 100 to over 800. The numbers are staggering, even more so when one considers that the number of indictable offences has actually decreased by 20 per cent over the same period, that clear-up rates have been stable since 1995 and that 42 per cent fewer people report being victims of crime.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08020549000020"></a>That is crucial evidence on the extent to which we are criminalising our young people today. I believe that it is a disaster for our society and our young people. We know beyond peradventure that custody does virtually nothing to prevent reoffending, as more than 80 per cent of very young offenders 15 and under reoffend. Moreover, as has just been discussed, the experience of custody, the removal from home, the disruption of lives and the inevitable alienation of our younger generation, who represent our tomorrow, all of those actually promote criminal behaviour.</p>

<a name="80205-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08020549000021"></a>We already know that these young people represent the most damaged and vulnerable in our society, for whom treatment and help is desperately needed. However, I fear that we have said this so often that it is becoming a platitude and no one listens to it any more. I am in no way trying to justify or minimise the crimes that young people can and do commit. They can be awful, even disgusting. But let us remember the evidence: offending has been stable; it is custody that has gone up. Furthermore, as we will hear over and over again,

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08020549000022"></a>I am aware that we are developing a culture in our society in which the young are increasingly disliked, even feared. This is being reflected in our legislation. ASBOs, to which the noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred, are born of this. I am also aware how much Ministers dislike international comparisons, but the fact is that, of every 100,000 under 18, we lock up 23&#151;I think that this has already been mentioned&#151;while in France the figure is six.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08020549000026"></a>I turn to the amendment in my name and that of my noble friend. It is important that we do everything in our power to ensure that it becomes a reality that custody is indeed used as a last resort, for we risk doing great damage to our society as well as our children&#151;and we must keep on saying &#147;children&#148;. The amendments go some way towards achieving this by requiring the use of a YRO first, unless of course the offence is so serious that the YRO cannot be justified. It is an important safeguard, given the reality of what is happening in the use of custody for children today.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08020549000027"></a>The new clause in our amendment would require an ISSP&#151;intensive supervision and surveillance programme&#151;to have been tried before a detention and training order is imposed. The point of YROs is to enable the courts to have greater flexibility in their sentencing, which we welcome, so that the punishment fits not only the crime but the offender. Again, this presumes that all options are available. Having an ISSP as part of the new menu of YROs would further ensure that custody was truly a last resort&#151;the last bulwark. However, it is important that the ISSP option should not be used as a substitute for other community sentences&#151;it must come as the last ditch&#151;although there is evidence that this is happening. However, if it is retained as the last ditch, custody is more likely to be the last resort. That is what our new clause aims to achieve.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08020549000028"></a>I have met and talked to the people who deliver ISSPs; I did so a year or so back in Peckham. I was very impressed by the commitment that they brought to the work, which is indeed very intensive. The work was, in this case, carried out by young men who were often from the same estates as the young offender and who offered understanding and friendship as well as the supervision required; they gave the sense of being involved in the same form of living. The evidence so  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_992"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 992</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>far from the past four to five years is that these programmes are working well. However, the investment in time and money is considerable, though justified. That leaves only the question of the extent to which the programmes are available.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08020549000029"></a>It still remains possible for this provision to be bypassed either under Sections 90 and 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 or for &#147;dangerous offenders&#148; sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 if the offence is so very serious or violent. Therefore, ISSPs do not act as a way out of bringing those other, more serious considerations to bear.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08020549000030"></a>I urge the Minister to give these amendments the most serious consideration, as they go to the heart of how we manage offending young people while keeping custody as a last resort, which I know that he, too, wants. I hope that he can reassure us that the necessary investment of money and manpower is in place so that this is a reality.</p>

She knows a lot about these things and has put it simply. She pointed out that youth offending is static and that it is custody that has gone up. That is the truth of the matter and we should be very worried by it. The Minister tried to dismiss the notion that international comparisons are necessarily relevant, but he must be careful to look properly at those figures. They must be relevant. Young people are not all that different these days; they all take part in youth culture. Comparisons matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08020549000032"></a>The Government of the day should be giving a lead on this. We have gone a bit mad on young people&#146;s criminality. The media are a bit shocking on the subject; they interact with public opinion and people are afraid of what will happen when they meet a young person. It has all become completely out of hand. I think that the Government should be beginning to educate people about this; they should have the courage to give a lead. I am sure that my party would assist in that, from what I understand of its thinking. A lead should be given and people should begin to understand that, in most cases, shutting someone up makes the situation much worse. We all understand that it is occasionally necessary. For certain young people, there is, for a variety of reasons, no alternative. However, that is seldom the case. The figures that we have heard this evening are shocking. I wonder whether the Government might contemplate beginning to educate the public on this subject, which I believe would be extremely helpful.</p>

First, I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, mentioned the ridiculous Youth Justice Board target to achieve a 10 per cent reduction in the number of those in custody, as that highlights one of the problems. This area is bedevilled by a large number of silly and inappropriate targets, which deflect people from the real purpose.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08020549000034"></a>My second point is that, as I mentioned earlier, in our consideration of the Children and Young Persons Bill we have been discussing just this sort of problem in relation to children who are in the hands either of the Minister for Children, who happens to be in the Department for Children, Schools and Families, or of the social services. This shows up the lack of a joined-up approach. Surely if there is a Minister for Children and she really is responsible for them, she should be made responsible for pulling together all the people who have a responsibility in this area. We seem to have a totally fragmented approach, which I do not think is helpful.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08020549000035"></a>My third point reflects something that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said. I have said this on many occasions in relation to many other things. None of this will happen unless someone is made responsible and accountable for making it happen. You can have Ministers speaking and officials writing goodness knows what, but unless somebody is made to do it, it will remain as a spoken or written word. The amendments highlight the need to have doers doing things rather than talkers talking.</p>

First, there is a danger in our debates of pulling apart the welfare of the child and the needs of the community. If we need a theme it is to bring those two things together. When we are serving the needs and welfare of children, we are serving the needs of society, the community and victims. When we are attending to the needs of victims and society, we should properly be attending to the welfare of children. If we can hold those things together we will get it right.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08020549000037"></a>Secondly, public policy needs to be consistent. When local authorities take children into care, the one thing they seek to avoid, if possible, is putting them into residential units, which is a last resort solution for children. We have the needs of the child in mind and our experience of such homes in the past means that we are very cautious about that solution. Thirdly&#151;this has not been said in the debate&#151;if it is necessary within those principles to take children into custody, such must be the conduct that that too serves the interests of children and their welfare. There is a danger of saying, &#147;We don&#146;t know what to do with this hard core of children and young people who we can&#146;t cope with in society, so we must put them in custody&#148;. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, reminded us earlier of 60 young people with three staff looking after them. That is 60 too many in custody. The style and content of what we are seeking to achieve for children who are held in custody is part of this issue.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater of Butterstone, put her finger on the benefits of this approach. I hope that the Minister will take it to heart and respond, as clearly the intentions are good and the results are good for the community, whom we have to do our best to protect. Above all, we need the extra resources to stop the offender reoffending. I agree entirely with the right reverend Prelate.</p>

I want to say briefly why I think the Bill&#146;s current option will not help in reversing the increase in child custody that my noble friend Lady Linklater so eloquently pointed out.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08020549000041"></a>We know that without a clear restriction on custody, courts will wholly or largely substitute that for other community sentences. There is good evidence for that. The ISS programme, which was rolled out nationally in October 2003, was made available to courts on a significant scale with 5,568 placements in 2005-06, and 1,350 places in use at any one time. It has been heavily promoted as an intensive and robust programme, and the evaluation evidence is that it successfully addresses a wide range of needs among serious and persistent young offenders. Yet, as my noble friend, pointed out, in a period when youth crime has been stable, the number in custody has risen.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08020549000042"></a>As currently drafted the Bill is unlikely to change that. The Government argue that under Clause 1(4), ISS would be available only for offences that are</p>
<ul><a name="08020549000069"></a>&#147;(a) ... punishable with imprisonment&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020549000054"></a>and when,</p>
<ul><a name="08020549000070"></a>&#147;(b) the court is of the opinion that the offence ... was so serious that&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020549000055"></a>custody would otherwise be appropriate.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08020549000043"></a>However, the test in subsection (4)(a) simply identifies the maximum sentence a category of offence can attract, saying nothing about what the particular offence or person warrants. Subsection (4)(b) is highly subjective, which turns on the court&#146;s opinion. Neither of those provisions directly tackles the uses of custody, which is what we are seeking to address with the proposed new clause.</p>

The JCHR wants statutory protection for government policy that custody should be the last resort. We have two amendments that seek to achieve that objective.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_995"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 995</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80205-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08020549000045"></a>I have a question for the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater of Butterstone. What if an offender commits a first offence that is so serious that the child represents a real threat to public safety? Both the amendments require a sentence that is below the custody threshold, but those circumstances must raise the question of whether one can generalise the situation to that degree. That is just a thought.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08020549000046"></a>We fully agree that a custody sentence should be the last resort; it should be used only when everything else has been tried. In that sense we are completely in tune with the animating spirit of the amendments. The JCHR report states that the Government are also in agreement with them. The difficulty with these amendments is the one that faced the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, in the amendment she moved almost at the beginning of today&#146;s proceedings. How do we make such amendments have operational effect? When we get into the micromanagement of the criminal justice system, at every turn there are specific provisions in different forms of legislation, some of which stretch back years if not decades, which frustrate these objectives. Putting them on the statute book will not override the specific obligation.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08020549000047"></a>That is why we have taken a slightly different approach from that of my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, by tabling a series of amendments in the sentencing part of the Bill to give sufficient flexibility to the bench of magistrates or the circuit judge to prevent them having to ratchet up orders until a custodial sentence becomes obligatory for a minor offence.</p>

I gabbled it rather, because I am very bad at reading out the names of the sections. Sections 90 and 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, or dangerous offender sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, can bypass the situation that we are talking about. Where the noble Lord is worried about what to do about the very serious and violent offender, there is provision for that to be invoked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08020549000052"></a>I emphasise again that, in my view, the key to all this is trust: trust the individual who is trying the case; trust him to get it right. Do not require him to end up awarding a custodial sentence in inappropriate circumstances.</p>

I must say that the prospect of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, being left-wing struck me with some amusement, as it certainly did him.</p>

He, the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Strathclyde, and I were each one of four opposed to the massed ranks of supporters of the noble Lord, Lord Steel. That is by way of inviting him to come back to our regular Friday engagements on that most important matter.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08020551000004"></a>I was very interested in the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, about the late Lucy Faithfull. My father, in addition to being a clergyman, was a social worker employed by Oxford City Council. For some time, Lucy Faithfull was director of social services. The noble Baroness will know that it was not only in your Lordships' House that she was a very much admired person. I shall come to the point that the noble Baroness raised about that piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08020551000005"></a>I was also interested in the whole question discussed by several noble Lords about how young people are regarded by society. There was a view among noble Lords that part of the reason that more young people are in custody reflects not what we might regard and what I described earlier as rational public opinion, but more emotion, where young people wearing hoodies are stigmatised. As someone with a number of young children still at home or at university, that concerns me.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08020551000006"></a>The answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is that the Government have a responsibility for encouraging society as a whole to think positively about the contribution that most young people make to our society. I think that young people now have to work much harder at school than I ever had to. Many of the pressures that they are under are considerably greater than when I was growing up. I also think that a benefit of the new department for children will be to enable us to have a greater focus in projecting the good things that so many young people do and represent. It is important to bear that in mind. Equally, with those children who are not so good, we have to have custodial sentences available as an option, but I agree that it should be as a last resort. That is what the law is and that is what we will seek to do in practice.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08020551000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, made some interesting comments about targets. I know all about targets as a former Minister for targets in the National Health Service. I well understand what he says: that when separate government departments, quangos or executive agencies have targets inconsistent with those of other agencies, you run into trouble. My experience is that that is easier to say than to do. It is not for the want of trying. The new PSA target approach recognises much more the need for interdepartmental consistency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08020551000008"></a>I am certainly not an expert but in the new approach to targets for local government, apart from giving much greater discretion to local authorities about which targets they choose, there is a much greater effort to get much greater consistency of approach because of the duty of partnership now laid on the partners of local government at local level. You cannot wave a magic wand and have that happen overnight, but it is part of our aims. It is the reason why joint responsibility between my department and the department for children on youth justice matters is so important.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08020551000009"></a>On Amendment No. 5, the Government's view is that custody is already a last resort for young people. The Judicial Studies Board, in the <I>Youth Court Bench Book</I> issued in March 2005, emphasised that. I assure the Committee that we will be seeking the help of the Sentencing Guidelines Council to issue guidance on sentencing, especially on youth rehabilitation orders.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08020551000010"></a>I refer the Committee to Section 152(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08020551000120"></a>&#147;The court must not pass a custodial sentence unless it is of the opinion that the offence, or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it, was so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified for the offence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020551000117"></a>The Bill makes it even clearer that custody is a last resort. I must say that we do not think that our approach is out of step with what is envisaged under the new clause contained in Amendment No. 5. I cannot offer an absolute undertaking, but I can agree to take this back to see what the Government can do with it.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08020551000011"></a>I hope that that shows that I do not disagree with many of the philosophical viewpoints that have been put forward. Also, on the question about people being placed in custody for minor offences, sometimes the tables are a little misleading. I offer to write to the Committee with a broader explanation. Many offences in the table, which may include robbery, for instance, would not be listed as violent. There are issues about the description and categorisation on which I offer to provide an aide memoire, if noble Lords would find it helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08020551000012"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 6 I accept that, in every case where a court is contemplating a custodial sentence for a child or young person, the court ought to consider whether a youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance or intensive fostering is appropriate before resorting to the sentence of ultimate severity. I agree with the noble Baronesses, Lady Linklater and Lady Falkner, over the importance of that option for the courts.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08020551000013"></a>The problem that we have, which was hinted at by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is accepting the proposition that the court cannot impose a custodial sentence unless the young offender has previously received a youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance. Of course, we see ISS as a last step before custody. Indeed, it has been designed for those young offenders who would, if it did not exist, be subject to a custodial sentence. We are at one with the noble Baronesses on that.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08020551000014"></a>We believe that the Bill provides adequate safeguards to ensure that ISS is used as a direct alternative to custody. The points raised about experience by the noble Baronesses are interesting. The aim of ISS was to reduce the frequency and seriousness of subsequent offending among persistent offenders. Research shows that the frequency of offending in the intensive supervision and surveillance sample went down by 39 per cent over two years. I know we can all trade figures and I am always urging caution in that regard, but that must have some encouragement for all of us.</p>

<a name="80205-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08020551000015"></a>I am discovering that &#147;uptariffing&#148; is the word used in criminal justice circles. I understand what is meant by that and it is not good. It is to be avoided but we know what we mean. We are obviously concerned about that and our hope is that sentencing guidelines will assist sentencers in ensuring that penalties are appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08020551000016"></a>There has been a very interesting debate about the balance between micromanagement, to which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred, and discretion to the judiciary. It depends which argument we want at any one time and we all have to be cautious and recognise that there is always a balance. There are times when the Government consider it is right to be prescriptive, and there are circumstances in which discretion needs to be given to the judiciary. We will argue about that.</p>

<a name="80205-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08020551000017"></a>However, we have the problem that the detention and training order is the only custodial order available to the youth court. Generally, it is the sentence available to the courts for a juvenile who has committed an offence which, if committed by an adult, would be liable to a maximum sentence of less than 14 years&#146; imprisonment. All the same, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested, it means that it is available for some very serious offences. For example, an offender may have committed several violent offences previously and not received a youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance or intensive fostering. The clause as drafted would preclude the courts from imposing a custodial sentence where it deemed it necessary. For that reason, we have problems with Amendment No. 6, although I hope noble Lords will recognise that we do not have any disagreement at all with the general principle of it being used as a last resort for custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08020551000023"></a>As far as political pressure is concerned, inevitably we are all conditioned by public opinion and there has been a debate for some years about the appropriateness of custody.

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08020551000026"></a>Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, a breach of the guidelines does not render a sentence unlawful, but it is within a whisker of that result because the clearest hint is given to the Court of Appeal that the sentence would be unsupportable. For that reason, what the Minister has said has come very near to everything that would have been achieved by the amendments we have been discussing on a declaration of custody being the last resort.

Alongside the statement I have repeated that this should be seen as a last option, the introduction of youth rehabilitation orders and the other programmes, it is clear that we need to do much more in terms of educational programmes and reintegrating into society young people who have been in custody. That is where our joint work with the Department for Children, Schools and Families is so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08020551000030"></a>I am afraid that custody, although a last resort, is a necessary option. We recognise that we have to do much more for those young people who are placed into custody.</p>

He suggested that Amendment No. 6 would rule out the ability to bypass the system on the sentencing of certain offences. Does he not accept that Sections 90 and 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, or &#147;dangerous offender&#148; sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, cover all the serious and potentially serious violent and sexual offences? Examples are murder, manslaughter, arson, rape, sexual assault, GBH/wounding with intent, firearms/prohibited weapons use/possession/distribution and robbery/assault with intent to rob, domestic burglary/aggravated general burglary and drugs class A to C production/supply/possession with intent to supply.

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08020551000048"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 7, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 8 to 11, 18, 21, 24 to 27, 42, 42A, 50 to 62, 63A, 64A, 179 and 180. These are miscellaneous, minor and technical amendments, but, out of courtesy to the Committee, I intend to speak briefly to them. They come in two batches: I will deal first with Amendments Nos. 24, 63A, 64A, 179 and 180, which make up the smaller batch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08020551000049"></a>Amendment No. 24 ensures that the provisions in Part 1 are properly aligned with Armed Forces legislation and vice versa, and that the provisions fully reflect the new probation arrangements in Part 1 of the Offender Management Act 2007, which are to come into force in phases from 1 April 2008. Amendments Nos. 63A and 64A to Clause 7 simply remove definitions which we have concluded are redundant in this context. Amendment No 24 to Schedule 1 ensures that the schedule reflects the special sentencing powers of service courts. Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 to Schedule 36 ensure that the Armed Forces Act 2006, which applies the Criminal Justice Act 2003 for certain purposes, reflects the amendments made by the Bill to that Act. The amendments ensure that the civil and military sentencing frameworks remain in balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08020551000050"></a>The remaining amendments in this group, starting with Amendment No. 7, are necessary to make reference to Part 1 of the Offender Management Act 2007. They ensure that the duties and responsibilities that the provisions on youth rehabilitation orders place on local probation boards are also placed on other providers of probation services. Noble Lords know that the Offender Management Act 2007 places the statutory duty for the provision of probation services on the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may make provision himself, or may contract with other organisations to provide those probation services. Any other organisation, whether public, private or third sector, that is so contracted will be referred to as a provider of probation services. The staff delivering these duties will be known as officers of a provider of probation services.</p>

When I discovered that it was not mandatory for children to be represented, I was completely horrified. That a civilised society could prosecute vulnerable, probably ignorant, deprived children, however brutish or unpleasant they might be in appearance, forcing them to appear before some court or other, without properly trained legal assistance, strikes me as abhorrent. I can put it no lower than that. It is almost certainly against Section 6 of the Human Rights Act, and it is against Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

If the numbers are low, there can be no cost implications at all. If the numbers are high, it is a screaming scandal and has to be put right. As noble Lords know, Cardinal Morton&#146;s fork worked out for Henry VII, as he said, that &#147;if you do not look rich you are hiding your money, so I am going to tax you. If you do look rich, you have a lot to spend, so I am going to tax you&#148;. On this issue, if there are none, it can be afforded, and if there are many, it must happen. I beg to move.</p>

It is sometimes forgotten that it is the duty of a legal representative to assist the court, not simply to advance the case of his or her client. It is very much in the interests of the court, and therefore justice, that a child or young person should be legally represented in all circumstances, save the most exceptional. I am warmly in support of this amendment.</p>

I apologise for missing the first 30 seconds of his contribution. I think he said that the Joint Committee on Human Rights was very surprised to find that there is no legal requirement for children to be represented in legal proceedings, as indeed we were.</p>

<a name="80205-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08020551000061"></a>The Bill expressly provides for representation when a fostering order is being considered, but not when a child might go into custody. In correspondence with the Government, the Minister told the committee that this was a reasonable provision because there are already a number of safeguards in place to ensure that a young person will be granted publicly funded representation where necessary, mainly in the form of the interests of justice test in the Access to Justice Act 1999; and that legal representation is available to anyone facing criminal proceedings where it is in the interests of justice that public funding should be granted. The Minister also told the committee that accompanying guidance states that the court should give consideration to whether the defendant is of a young age, and to the defendant&#146;s ability to understand the proceedings or to state his own case.</p>

<a name="80205-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08020551000062"></a>The Government also said, in probably the most significant part of their submission, that extending the scope of publicly funded representation for children,</p>
<ul><a name="08020551000133"></a>&#147;could impact significantly on legal aid funding&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020551000063"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights, needless to say, was not convinced by the Minister&#146;s arguments. The committee was surprised, given the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to general comment 10, issued by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2007. The general comment has a large section on the right of the child to be heard. Article 12(2) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that a child be,</p>
<ul><a name="08020551000134"></a>&#147;provided with the opportunity to be heard in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly or through a representative or an appropriate body in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80205-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08020551000064"></a>The committee also stresses the right to effective participation in the proceedings. Finally, the committee says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="08020551000130"></a>&#147;The child must be guaranteed legal or other appropriate assistance in the preparation and presentation of his/her defence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08020551000065"></a>The committee recommends that the state parties provide as much as possible for adequate, trained legal assistance. This is a rich country. The Committee on the Rights of the Child would clearly expect the United Kingdom to be able to afford trained legal assistance for children coming before the courts. It is my experience and, no doubt, that of those who are involved in this work that the children and families caught up in this system are

In our discussion of children and young persons with regard to the Bill, a very large amount of time has been devoted to advocacy and to making certain that advocates are available whenever disciplining young people is involved. Again, that links to the fact that this should undercut the whole administration of youth justice. The second subject of considerable concern was the suggestion that young juvenile asylum seekers and others should brief their own solicitors. Have you ever heard anything so silly when they do not have English as their first language and know nothing about the law, let alone about this country? This suggests that this whole business of the legal representation of the young needs to be looked at seriously right across the board and not only in the context of the amendment.</p>

In paragraph 19 in Part 2 of the schedule, a young person can be legally represented before a local authority residence or fostering requirement can be imposed under a YRO. However, no legal representation is required before any other version of the YRO can be imposed, including even the ISS. This astonishment was echoed by the JCHR, and so it should be by the rest of us when the outcome could be so serious, and with the long-standing implications of which we are all aware.</p>

<a name="80205-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08020551000069"></a>Furthermore, the best interests of the child are the primary consideration, as required by the CRC. As it happens, provision is made in the Bill for when a fostering requirement is being considered, and quite rightly, but why not for when all the other requirements, which have similar important implications, are being considered? What is the logic for excluding the other requirements for legal representation, in particular the ISSP, which may be imposed as a last resort before custody? What could be more serious for the future of a child than that? Indeed, a breach of the YRO may result in custody. It would be contrary to Article 6 of the ECHR, which says that legal representation is required for children to have a fair hearing. The court must be in a position to have all the circumstances of the child explained to it, particularly if the suitability and proportionality issues are to be properly addressed and if the child is to have all decisions properly explained to him or her.</p>

I also understand that the Government have concerns, as we have already heard, about the potential costs of such representation for children in criminal proceedings. That is simply not worthy of the Government on such an important issue; I want to rap them over the knuckles for that. I also know that, because of costs, there is a risk that the children may get poorer representation. Neither of these possibilities is acceptable; rather, they underline the importance of explicit, statutory representation for children, unless in the unlikely event there happens to be an &#147;informed waiver of representation&#148;. It is inappropriate to argue, as the Government do, that legal representation would be unavailable to a child who was refused it, who failed to apply for it, or who behaved badly, given the potentially life-changing outcomes of the proceedings. Clearly, it must be in the best interests of the child that there is a general right to legal representation, and we wholeheartedly urge the Government to support our amendments.</p>

The case proves itself over and over again. Legal aid is a dark cloud that hovers on the horizon of justice all too often. This has a lot to do with the fact that those funds comes from a small department that has a limited budget and with the fact that comparatively small increases year by year reflect themselves in substantial percentages. I have been aware of that for many decades, and it is one of the great impediments to the development of justice in our land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08020551000072"></a>I have no doubt that there is a massive moral obligation and, I believe, a convention obligation on the Government, with regard to the rights of the child. It is not sufficient to say that the child&#146;s situation must somehow or other contract itself into a situation that justice demands. It should be the other way round: in other words, the child has a right to representation unless the situation contracts itself out of the consideration of justice.</p>

<a name="80205-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08020551000073"></a>For those reasons, I urge the Government to reconsider the position. Not only is it a matter of justice, it is a matter of considerable assistance as far as the court itself is concerned. More time and money are lost by judges and magistrates going out of their way to satisfy themselves that they have covered every possible situation in relation to an unrepresented defendant than in the opposite case. That has been my experience.</p>

I really feel that this country is in the state of

It is also counterproductive&#151;to use that appalling word&#151;because, as the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has already said, children or other people who are not represented waste the time of the court. I know that from my own experience. It takes longer for cases to be heard; judges and magistrates fall over backwards to try to help the children, and cases that could be disposed of quickly, sensibly and to the best advantage of the administration of justice as well as the best advantage of the child drag on because the child is not represented.</p>

<a name="80205-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08020551000076"></a>There are good, practical cost implications. Of course, legal aid will be a concern, but, if legal aid is seen in the light of the cost of the administration of justice, an area at which, it seems to me, government almost never looks, we can see how much can be saved by spending legal aid.</p>

However, since 1 November 2007, all defendants under the age of 18 are passported through the means test.

That test plainly applies to circumstances in which someone is likely to be imprisoned, but more broadly it is better expressed as posing the question, &#147;Is this individual&#146;s liberty at risk?&#148;. It is that issue which is of crucial significance, particularly in relation to youth rehabilitation orders. There are certain combinations of a youth rehabilitation order which would amount to quite a serious deprivation of liberty and would fall squarely within the interests of justice test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08020556000003"></a>The ideas that animate these amendments are compelling, but we all recognise that there is great pressure on the legal aid budget. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has rightly pointed out that actually there is a lot of misplaced weight on that budget because money spent publicly to fund representation saves an enormous amount of court time and leads more often than not to higher quality judicial decisions. But that is a general argument about legal aid upon which the Minister may or may not wish to express an opinion. The issue to which the Minister must address himself is how the 1999 Act bears on youth sentencing.</p>

The amendments seek to ensure that all children and young persons are publicly funded where the court is considering opposing a youth rehabilitation order. The case has been argued with great force that there should be automatic funding, but I have to say that the Government would resist that. We believe that the existing arrangements for the provision of legal representation already provide sufficient safeguards for young defendants.</p>

<a name="80205-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08020556000005"></a>I want to reflect in part the words of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Under the Access to Justice Act 1999, all defendants must satisfy the interests of justice test in order to qualify for publicly funded representation. In deciding this, the court takes into account, among other factors, whether the defendant may suffer serious damage to his or her reputation or whether the charge is punishable with imprisonment. The court also gives consideration to whether the defendant is of a young age and to their ability to understand the proceedings or to state their own case. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, pointed out, since October 2006, defendants appearing before the magistrates&#146; court and youth court have also been required to pass a financial eligibility test to qualify for publicly funded representation, but from November 2007, all defendants under the age of 18 have been passported through the means test. That change has been widely welcomed by the professional judiciary and the Law Society.</p>

<a name="80205-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08020556000006"></a>In practical terms, it will be extremely rare for a young person not to pass the interests of justice test. Indeed, the figures from January to December 2007 show that 95,000 legal aid applications were made, of which 1,598&#151;1.7 per cent&#151;failed the test. It is a small figure. Given his argument, the noble Earl will damn me if I do and damn me if I do not. I accept that it can be argued either way, but at least I have given him the straight figures.</p>

A figure of 1 per cent when allied to what the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has said, means that I could probably take the Minister out to dinner on the difference to the amount of money it is actually going to cost the legal aid budget.

So good, in fact, that all noble Lords in this House assembled would also enjoy a very good dinner. I will come on to the question of resources because, as noble Lords know, I am responsible for legal aid at the Ministry of Justice. I want just to say that we cannot ignore the cost issue. The question for noble Lords is where the interests of justice test might not be met. The kind of example I have been given is one such as where a young person aged 17 in full-time education is charged with a relatively minor crime such as being drunk and disorderly in a public place. There may be an aggravating factor such as using offensive language to members of the public. Such a person might receive a youth rehabilitation order, depending on other sentences he may previously have received. The offender is familiar with the court process, having been before the youth court for relatively minor offences on previous occasions. Custody is not an option for such offence as he is not working for a living, so he will not lose his livelihood. Such a person might be held not to satisfy the interests of justice test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08020556000010"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the circumstances he suggested, I would have thought it rare for a young person who might receive a youth rehabilitation order not to meet the interests of justice test. Indeed, it is worth quoting from the Access to Justice Act 1999 the factors that the court has to consider,</p>
<ul><a name="08020556000041"></a>&#147;whether the individual would if any matter arising in the proceedings is decided against him be likely to lose his liberty or livelihood, or suffer serious damage to his reputation; ... whether the determination of any matter arising in the proceedings may involve consideration of a substantial question of law; ... whether the individual may be unable to understand the proceedings or state his own case; ... whether the proceedings may involve the tracing, interviewing or expert cross-examination of witnesses on behalf of the individual, and ... whether it is in the interests of another person that the individual be represented&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020556000038"></a>For the great majority of cases where the defendant is under 18 years of age, the interests of justice test will be held to be satisfied because the defendant would be considered to be unable to follow the proceedings. This is not being dealt with in isolation. The Legal Services Commission is about to start research into the consistency of decision-making under the interests of justice test. This will provide a much clearer analysis of the application of this test in relation to the under-18s and clearly it will inform any potential change of policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08020556000011"></a>Why do we give automatic legal aid representation for local authority residence or fostering requirements? The rationale for that is because both the LA residence and fostering requirements will require the young person to abide at somewhere other than their usual place of

That is different from the other YRO options which, although offering perhaps the most stringent community sentence in some cases, particularly with ISS, will not result in the young person physically being removed from their home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08020556000012"></a>I understand the comments that noble Lords and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, have made about legal aid and the interesting point that curtailing expenditure on legal aid may lead to additional costs in the administration of justice. That is a matter of which we are mindful. I am determined that the legal aid reforms should go with the grade of a more efficient system within the courts and that the incentives all work in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08020556000013"></a>On legal aid spending&#151;I know that noble Lords will quote back at me that you cannot take all the figures for international comparisons at face value&#151;we have the most generous system in the world. I am proud of that. We have to make sure that we spend the money wisely. There has been a huge increase in legal aid spending over the past 10 years&#151;it now stands at &#163;2 billion&#151;and we have to be careful that we spend it wisely. That is why I am persuaded that we have it about right and the access to justice test means that the right decisions are made.</p>

An estimated cost of agreeing to the noble Earl&#146;s amendment would be about &#163;800,000. He may say that &#163;800,000 is not a lot of money, but it is.

But when you take into account the time it takes the court to try to determine each of the issues&#151;on some of which it must be quite difficult to come to a conclusion&#151;taking the net figure, is it really not worth &#163;800,000 to avoid those costs?</p>

That is not being profligate with public money and it would add to the totality of justice in this situation.</p>

The Minister will know that there was a time when the legal aid authorities decided that everyone should have legal aid regardless of their means and so on because the cost of administering the scheme as it then was far exceeded the savings on the very small number of people who did not qualify.

We do not have plea bargaining in this country but we certainly have bargaining about charges&#151;to what charges will the defendant plead guilty; what charges will the prosecution drop? An enormous saving in time and administration is made by bargaining of that kind. Then if there are pleas of guilty properly advised by a lawyer, the lawyer is then concerned with marshalling all those matters which are necessary for the court to come to a proper conclusion as to which restrictions and requirements would be necessary, in this case in the youth rehabilitation order that is being considered.</p>

I thought I had answered the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew. It is sometimes difficult to aggregate figures, although we have the figures for legal aid, which I quoted. I am sorry, but &#163;800,000 is still a considerable amount of money. My understanding is that, in the cases we are talking about, the test is refused if the offence is very minor, there is no likelihood of a custodial sentence, the youth is at the top of the age range and he or she understands court proceedings. I have said that the Legal Services Commission is going to undertake some research on consistency of approach. I am not aware that this is proving to be a huge administrative task, and in any case the LSC&#146;s research may well pick up issues that we need to improve. Today, however, I am afraid I am going to disappoint your Lordships.</p>

Yet they cannot find &#163;800,000 to represent the most poor and vulnerable in court. I am convinced that it costs the courts more than &#163;800,000 not to have them represented. Perhaps the Minister owes me dinner on the extra money that is being spent by the courts in saving &#163;800,000. That is pathetic, and I have every intention of coming back to the issue on Report.

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08020564000003"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am raising two separate but related matters: how government papers, including ministerial papers, are kept after leaving their working departmental offices and the record of major events described in Crown copyright official histories. The responsibility lies with the Cabinet Office and then, I suppose, with the Prime Minister, which is appropriate, as Gordon Brown identifies himself as a historian.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08020564000004"></a>In passing, I pay tribute to Tessa Stirling, the head of the Histories, Openness and Records Unit at the Cabinet Office, who was awarded a CBE in the New Year Honours. She has been well known to many professional historians for her long, devoted service, and she was very patient when I, not being a professional historian, asked some pressing questions. </p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08020564000005"></a>This is an opportunity for me to welcome the new history and policy project launched in December. Inspired by Cambridge University and others, endorsed by the All-Party History Group and blessed by <I>Prospect</I> magazine, it is designed to improve public policy through the better understanding of history. I hope that it will be successful.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08020564000006"></a>My first concern this evening is about government papers&#151;lesser papers than Cabinet papers&#151;which are stored until they are disposed of. My interest arose when I was seeking papers on two issues that were important when I was Secretary of State for Transport in 1976. Early in 2005, I asked the Department for Transport for papers arising from two ministerial areas: the public inquiry into the controversial widening of the Archway road, the A1, and critical decisions made by the Government on whether to support the proposed Tyne and Wear metro railway. Despite toing and froing between me and the department for over six months, I finally abandoned any hope of finding anything except a single, incomplete file.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08020564000007"></a>The departmental records officer went to a great deal of trouble, but I was unhappy about the condition of the papers kept in a repository at Hastings. It was possible, I discovered, that my papers might or might not have been retained. The contents of the files, although kept, might or might not have been accurately and comprehensively identified, and the titles might or might not have been changed. I am certainly not an archivist, but there is no point in keeping archives unless they are professionally catalogued and carefully managed. On the face of it, the papers of the Department for Transport were in a mess.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08020564000008"></a>Eventually, on 24 January 2006, I wrote to the Secretary to the Cabinet, Sir Gus O&#146;Donnell. I said that I no longer wished to pursue the two matters that I had raised with the Department for Transport; my concern now was the broad question of Whitehall papers once they had left the working offices and before the National Archives had decided what to  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1014"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1014</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>retain. I shall not bother the House with all the details, but the Cabinet Secretary said that departmental record-keeping was of a much higher standard than it used to be, that there had been several inquiries and that an interdepartmental group had looked at the problems of storing and archiving of private office records. As a result, in 2001, the previous Cabinet Secretary had given guidance to the Permanent Secretaries, and that was revised in 2004.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08020564000009"></a>That is where the matter rested, as Sir Gus said that the guidance would be looked at again during 2006-07, when the Cabinet Office would monitor how the departments had acted on their recent guidance. I am asking the Minister for a report of the outcome and what has been achieved. In particular, is every Permanent Secretary at least maintaining a good records system, or, if not, is there any sanction to ensure that the job is properly done? Could experts from the marvellous National Archives at Kew be asked to set up a model records system for every department?</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08020564000010"></a>I turn to my second separate but related issue: official histories. Here, I declare an interest, wholly unremunerated, as a member of a group of three privy counsellors together with the noble Lord, Lord Healey, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, appointed by the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to approve the authors of official histories. Outside that responsibility or role, however, I have become interested in the planning and overall management of official histories.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08020564000011"></a>The first official history that I remember was <I>Problems of Social Policy</I> by R.M. Titmuss, published in 1950. Apart from being an account of wartime experience, it was a seminal text on poverty and deprivation and how to try to deal with it. Many years later, I was required to take a ministerial interest in a very different kind of official history, <I>The SOE in France</I> by M.R.D. Foot. There is a huge series of military histories of the Second World War and, since 1966, a series that is described as &#147;History of peacetime events&#148;. I am much impressed by the number of volumes and the quality of those that I have read. I have read two recent volumes on the Falklands War and dipped into two volumes of separate series on early aspects of Britain&#146;s membership of the European Union. There has been a history of Britain and the Channel Tunnel, and a biography, <I>Churchill&#146;s Man of Mystery: Desmond Morton and the World of Intelligence</I>, which I have much enjoyed.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08020564000012"></a>That book, <I>Churchill&#146;s Man of Mystery</I>, has focused my mind on some wider policy questions about the official history programme: the timetable and shape of the programme, the publisher, the contracts with authors, and the marketing of the books. I am strongly in favour of the endeavour, but is it being done in the best way? <I>Churchill's Man of Mystery</I> seems to be a one-off: admirable, but not in a biographical series. It has a well designed jacket and tells a fascinating story. However, when I wanted to buy a copy, I found that it was not in my local book shop. When I eventually found it, the cost was &#163;49, which is a ridiculous price and out of the range of many book buyers. It should have sold 5,000 to 6,000 copies or more at &#163;25 to &#163;30 and perhaps  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1015"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1015</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been serialised in a newspaper and considered for a television programme. Who made these decisions? How many copies have been sold? Were there book reviews in the major newspapers and magazines, as there should have been?</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08020564000013"></a>There is a useful, explanatory Cabinet Office leaflet about the official history programme, but I am little uneasy about the detailed arrangements. This is not a debate that lends itself to all the questions, but, to use a fashionable phrase, I ask whether it is not time for an audit. I do not mean an audit by the tireless Audit Commission, but a fresh look at these matters by a distinguished historian, perhaps accompanied by a major commercial publisher. For a historian, I think of Sir Michael Howard, emeritus professor of modern history at Oxford, Sir Keith Thomas, former president of Corpus Christi College at Oxford, or, of a younger generation, Professor David Cannadine, who is already working on the 30-year rule review. As for a publisher, there is the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, who was formerly chairman of Faber &amp; Faber for many years.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08020564000014"></a>This is a moment when almost every former Cabinet Minister is expected to write a personal memoir or publish a political diary; and many special advisers and spin doctors also are on the publishing bandwagon. For this reason, it is important to safeguard the basic government material of the past and, in due course, to publish independent accounts of aspects and events of the past. I do not ask the Minister to comment in detail on both the matters that I have raised, but I hope that the Cabinet Office will carefully consider all my points.</p>

<a name="08020564000015"></a><b><a name="80205-0011.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08020564000029"></a>Lord Bew:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, for giving the House the chance to discuss these important matters. I identify myself with his remarks about the history and policy project, which has already proved to be fruitful and interesting.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08020564000016"></a>The noble Lord offered two major themes for our consideration. The first relates to our current arrangements for the preservation of government archives. I think that many Members of your Lordships&#146; House will have been worried by the case from the noble Lord&#146;s own ministerial days that he laid out before us. Matters may have improved in recent years, as he has been reassured. The Freedom of Information Act may have had the knock-on effect of encouraging better record management. The Lord Chancellor&#146;s code of practice under Section 46 is said to have led to an improved level of government record retention, although the noble Lord&#146;s example this evening did not encourage me too much in that respect.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08020564000017"></a>The Freedom of Information Act has undoubtedly had another impact: it has inevitably increased the pressure on our hard-pressed archivists. I am conscious particularly of the situation in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland as Northern Ireland emerges from the Troubles. Under the Freedom of Information Act, it has become possible to make inquiries about difficult and contentious cases, which creates a labour for our archivists. They have done everything possible  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1016"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1016</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to maximise the release of material while using the device of redaction to preserve the health and safety of living persons. The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland does a remarkable job in preserving the collective memory of the Province, which is an essential part of the long-term healing process.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08020564000018"></a>At the heart of the debate is resource allocation. We must anticipate a lack of the sort of funding that would allow the absolutely satisfactory handling of government archives. At the moment, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said, the Government have a committee reviewing the working of the 30-year rule. It includes Paul Dacre, the editor of a very successful newspaper, and Professor David Cannadine, who is a very distinguished historian, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said. Given the special difficulties that relate to Northern Ireland, I am glad to say that it includes also Sir Joseph Pilling, a former Permanent Under-Secretary at the Northern Ireland Office. I should perhaps declare an interest to the extent that I served with Professor Cannadine on the committee of the Centre for Contemporary British History at the Institute of Historical Research in London.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08020564000019"></a>We live in an era of ever-increasing public demand for disclosure. These trends are irreversible. Recent court cases involving leaked documents are highly instructive in this respect. Even putting aside the issue of leaks, I say that we now put officially into the public domain material that a previous generation would have regarded as quite unthinkable. When I started graduate research in history at the University of Cambridge, it was impossible to obtain sensitive documents that related to security matters in Ireland in the 1870s and 1880s. At the time of the Bloody Sunday tribunal, we put into the public domain the most sensitive material relating to an incident in 1972&#151;not 1872. That shows the extent to which we have changed in our attitudes. The committee that I mentioned will have to decide whether adequate funding is in place to ensure that any change of the 30-year rule to 25 or 20 years is not counterproductive, perhaps even leading to the loss of important documentation. There is no doubt that the change from the 50- to the 30-year rule in 1977 led to a degree of administrative chaos, and it is important that that should not be repeated.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08020564000020"></a>Professor Rodney Lowe of Bristol University, who is a great expert in this field, has argued that the early release of documents would allow officials to speak more easily truth unto power and thereby contribute to better government. That may be true, but it will also certainly and inevitably lead to greater embarrassment. Even under the existing 30-year arrangement, we have had some very near misses. If we move to 25 or 20 years, it is certain that embarrassments will take place. Perhaps I may explain what I mean. At the turn of this year, British Foreign Office papers from 1977 were released in the normal way under the 30-year rule. They contained considerable salty, unflattering comment on the Irish political class. When the documents were released, they caused considerable irritation in the Dublin newspapers, and considerable aggrieved comment was made. Let us imagine what would happen if the young Foreign Office official who wrote those documents was at that time the British ambassador in Dublin. Such considerations have to be borne in mind.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1017"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1017</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80205-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08020564000021"></a>These embarrassments aside, the pressure over time to move a 20- or a 25-year rule&#151;it may not come from the committee, but it will happen over time&#151;is likely to be irreversible and irresistible. There are good reasons for it, of which I shall give the House an example. In 2001, in the United States, the biography of Congressman Tip O&#146;Neill was published by JA Farrell, the Washington correspondent of the <I>Boston Globe</I>. This is significant for our history, because it deals with the important matter of the decision of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, on the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985. Mr Farrell was able to access National Security Council archives, which showed the full Reagan/American side. Everyone accepts that that aspect was an important part of the noble Baroness&#146;s decision. We, however, will have to wait until 2016 before we know the other side. Such imbalances and ambiguities are in the end intolerable and will increase the pressure for a change to a 20-year or 25-year rule. Whether this committee acts is another matter, but, in time, the pressure will be hard to resist.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08020564000022"></a>However, one major and less controversial reform is open to the new committee. In 1958 the Public Record Office made an important and wise decision that the papers of Ministers&#146; private offices were public records. It is almost amazing that until that time they were not. The new review has the option, as Professor Lowe has pointed out, of establishing as public records such papers as those of special advisers&#151;increasingly important in recent years&#151;the Whips office, hived-off agencies, and private agencies financed by taxpayers&#146; money for delivering policy.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08020564000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, has also directed our attention to the subject of our official histories. The first UK official history programme was established in 1908, exactly 100 years ago as a reaction to the perceived failings of the Boer War. Military history has played a large part in the enterprise, as the noble Lord said, although he mentioned also the important work of Richard Titmuss at the LSE. We have recently been reminded that Professor Arthur Marder had an enormous struggle to secure the release of official documents for his acclaimed multi-volume history of the Royal Navy in the First World War, published between 1960 and 1974.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08020564000024"></a>Today, the atmosphere is much more relaxed. The vetting of material is much less strict, and we are entirely justified in looking forward with some enthusiasm to the works recently commissioned by the Cabinet Office. I am particularly looking forward to the history of an important part of our intelligence services being carried out by a colleague in my own university, Professor Keith Jeffery. If, as seems likely and desirable, we are to see an extension of the Cabinet Office&#146;s official history programme, we need, as the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, has urged, simultaneously a greater concern with the practicalities of publication. The taxpayer and the reading public deserve no less.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08020568000004"></a>I have had a lifelong love of history. I had the privilege of studying English social history at University College London under Professor Joel Hirschfield. I am still a subscriber to <I>History Today</I> and a devotee of the History Channel and the programmes of Professors Schama and Starkey on television. I am always suspicious of politicians who show no knowledge of or interest in history. As Winston Churchill once observed:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="08020568000178"></a>&#147;It is an error to believe that the world began when any particular party or statesman got into office. It has all been going on for quite a long time&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020568000005"></a>And so it has. But we are in danger, if we are not careful, of neglecting the raw material of history. If we do, we will rely too much on diaries and instant memoirs, as has already been mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08020568000006"></a>I have to declare that I have never kept a diary and that I have no intention of publishing a memoir. I am not a great fan of diaries as an historical source. It is like asking a football player to report a football match he is playing in. I know from my limited experience of writing a diary for <I>The House Magazine</I> that you become a kind of servant to the diary. The need to seem central and relevant to events makes the diarist an uncertain witness. On the other side of the fence, the idea that one or more colleagues may be scurrying home after a meeting to record their version of events cannot lend itself to free and frank discussion or great mutual confidence. As has been mentioned, we now also have the &#147;reductio and absurdum&#148; of the process with the publication of Mr Alastair Campbell&#146;s diaries, which, as we know, are the expurgated version because the details of the relationship between Mr Blair and Mr Brown are too lurid for contemporary eyes.</p>

<a name="80205-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08020568000007"></a>Of course official histories have their drawbacks, too. They always live in the shadow of being compared with Winston Smith plying his trade doctoring history in the Ministry of Truth. Even if we do not view them as part of a <I>1984</I> nightmare, we have to take on board the views of Barry Coward, president of the Historical Association, who said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08020568000179"></a>&#147;Official histories are a bad thing because they can be used for establishing government purposes and can be re-invented to support the official Establishment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020568000173"></a>He goes on to warn:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08020568000180"></a>&#147;History should not be used as a tool of Government&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80205-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08020568000008"></a>Such a warning should be taken on board. We do not want establishment history written by establishment historians. However, the official programme has set in train a programme of scholarship. It will not be the last word, but it will be invaluable to future historians. Jonathan Pepler, chair of the National Council on Archives, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="08020568000181"></a>&#147;NCA would ... want to put on record its appreciation of the quality of recent official histories. One of the best examples of these being last year&#146;s, &#147;The official history of Britain and the Channel Tunnel&#148;, by Dr Terry Gourvish&#148;.</p>

<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1019"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1019</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80205-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08020568000009"></a>In reality, what we are discussing tonight is another aspect of open government. It goes hand in hand with an effective Freedom of Information Act and the ending of the culture of secrecy in Whitehall. That is why it is important that policy on freedom of information and on archives and records should be a seamless garment. I have visited the National Archives at Kew and was very impressed with what I saw. But I am only an interested amateur. So let me put on record the view of Professor Peter Hennessey of Queen Mary college, London, who believes that it is the best national archive in the world. So the question is: how do we preserve this great national treasure? And I am referring not to Professor Hennessy but to the National Archives.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08020568000010"></a>First, I believe that the programme of official histories should be encouraged and maintained. And perhaps I may make a suggestion, as it has been mentioned already. I should like to see a study of the history and role of special and political advisers in Whitehall. I was once told that such implants go back at least as far as Lloyd George&#146;s time. A proper study would expose many of the myths and shibboleths about their role in governance.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08020568000011"></a>Secondly, there is a need to ensure that the work and efficiency of the National Archives at Kew is not weakened or undermined by the extra calls made by implementing the Freedom of Information Act. Can the Minister assure the House that there is no &#147;robbing Peter to pay Paul&#148; switch of resources and that Kew will not suffer such cuts to service freedom of information demands?</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08020568000012"></a>Thirdly, we all look forward to the review of the 30-year rule under the chairmanship of Paul Dacre. I must confess that when I first heard that Mr Dacre had been asked to undertake this study, I thought it was like asking Jack the Ripper to undertake a review of street lighting. Nevertheless we look forward to the review, and I note what the Prime Minister said when announcing it. He stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="08020568000182"></a>&#147;It is an irony that the information that can be made available on requests on current events and current decisions is still withheld as a matter of course for similar events and similar decisions that happened 20 or 25 years ago&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020568000174"></a>There was a good example of that last weekend when it was reported that an apparent tiff between Sir Anthony Eden and Churchill about the timing of Churchill&#146;s retirement had been kept secret for 50 years. It seems extraordinary that that should be so. A number of the embargos on the workings of government, the security services and royalty belong to a different age.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08020568000013"></a>Publication can create the danger of embarrassment, as the noble Lord, Lord Bew, said. The 30-year rule recently coughed up a memo that I sent to Jim Callaghan in 1977 advising him strongly not to see the troublesome Back-Bench Member for Hull, Mr John Prescott. By the time this all surfaced, Mr Prescott was Deputy Prime Minister. But I am absolutely sure that it did not change his view of me one jot to know that 30 years ago I had been doing that.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08020568000014"></a>We are all living longer, the Freedom of Information Act is becoming a reality of open government, and we will all have to come to terms with accepting the consequences of our actions when in government.  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1020"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1020</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, as the Hutton and Butler reports have shown, sofa government&#151;where major decisions are taken without a paper trail&#151;and the increasing use of new communication technologies mean that the archives may not always tell the whole story. It is 30 years since the then Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, asked his predecessor, Harold Wilson, for a review of record-keeping in Whitehall. In terms of how government is carried on and records kept, that was another age. I should therefore like to see, once we have the Dacre report and its recommendations, a more broad-based review to follow up the Wilson committee of 30 years ago. Such a committee could also look at the need and capability of preserving voice and visual records as well as e-mail traffic.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08020568000015"></a>As I said, history is important. It is important for all our citizens to know who we are and the events that have made us what we are. In my teens I was stimulated by the Granada programme hosted by Brian Inglis called &#147;All Our Yesterdays&#148;. I still think that it is a key part of citizenship that we understand where we are and what our history is. It is key that we encourage both record-keeping and openness of government. My noble friend Lord Rodgers has stimulated a very worthwhile debate. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Bew, that I would love to come to a full hour-long lecture by him on the subject. But I will leave that matter for the moment.</p>

<a name="08020568000016"></a><b><a name="80205-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08020568000209"></a>Lord Luke:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, for introducing this short but most useful debate. All of us ought to be interested in our forebears and history. I am therefore most disappointed in the small number of noble Lords present, particularly on my own Bench. As an amateur historian, I have always been fascinated by the parliamentary archive and in the preservation generally of documents, whether ancient or modern. The Parliamentary Archives, together with the National Archives, have custody of over 500 years of records, on parchment, paper, film, tape and photographic reproductions. House of Lords records are held largely in the Victoria Tower. It is some years since I last paid a visit but I was fascinated. I have been promised another visit and shall be doing that.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08020568000017"></a>Most early House of Commons records were destroyed in the devastating fire of 1834. Archives are kept as records of Parliament for various obvious reasons: as a legal and evidential record of Parliament&#146;s proceedings and work since the late 15th century, to help us to learn from history. But do we learn? Archives are kept to help the general public to learn about how their predecessors and ancestors lived and their achievements; to help historians, both professional and amateur, to prepare official histories, biographies and related activities and to carry out research.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08020568000018"></a>Parliamentary Archives is one of several offices that constitute the Clerk of the Parliaments&#146; department. The House of Lords Information Committee has oversight of the work of the archive. The archive, it goes without saying, provides an updated catalogue of all the other archives, and is still in the process of digitalising them and making sure that they are available online. It helps the public to inspect and copy records and to answer  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1021"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1021</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inquiries. It makes sure that the general public are aware of the existence of the archive and how they can use it for research and lifelong learning. It helps to provide that vital link between Parliament and people. It provides data for IT and encourages the use of that IT. It also helps the public and parliamentarians to use that resource. It has to ensure that records that are worthy of preservation&#151;who decides if they are worthy?&#151;are selected for the archive. It obtains and, if necessary, acquires other records deemed to contribute significantly to understanding the history and workings of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08020568000019"></a>Some archives have naturally deteriorated over the years and need conservation and then preservation from future damage. Clearly an efficient department carries out this work. I have read the archive&#146;s latest annual report, the publication date of which does not appear to be given. It is an interesting document, though I personally find the style and language in which it is written difficult to follow. It is clearly not written with the general public in mind. Perhaps something derived from such a document should be produced annually so that the general public can be informed about what is happening.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08020568000020"></a>During my researches I discovered that <I>Hansard</I> has been carefully preserved all through the years; that Acts of Parliament from the House of Lords are, by and large, in the Victoria Tower, as are many Acts originating in the House of Commons; that pamphlets and newspaper articles relevant to government and Parliament have been preserved; that the original warrant for the execution&#151;or, as I prefer to call it, murder&#151;of Charles I is kept, with other priceless important documents, in a specially air-conditioned room; and that there is regular and frequent communication between the House of Lords Library, the House of Commons Library and other libraries, the historical record office, the National Archives and many other depositories of historic documents.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08020568000021"></a>I have learnt a lot, and I hope absorbed a great deal, during the preparation for this debate. A great deal of dedicated work is carried out by the department. Here I must thank Dr Hallam Smith for her help and say how much I enjoyed her obvious enthusiasm. Archives are essential parts of our lives, not least because they bring a sense of immediacy to long-forgotten history&#151;lest we forget.</p>

It deals with an area that I cannot recall being voiced in the House before. This debate is therefore long overdue because we need to address issues relating to both archives and official histories. I hope that I shall be able to indicate that constructive work is being done. However, first, I want to put on record my gratitude for the helpful and interesting suggestions that have been made this evening, as they aid the Government&#146;s thinking in this area.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08020568000023"></a>I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, for his tribute to Tessa Stirling and the work that she has done in this area over many years. The honour that  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1022"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1022</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>she obtained was well deserved, and there is no doubt that the country owes her a great debt of gratitude for that work.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08020568000024"></a>A great deal of work is under way to ensure that the Government capture and maintain vital information that is generated. We recognise that government information is unique and an extremely valuable asset where robust information management is vital.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08020568000025"></a>It may help if I outline the arrangements that we have in place at the moment and indicate the areas where we need to think constructively about the future. As the official government archive for England, Wales and the United Kingdom, National Archives houses records from across central government that are mostly over 30 years old. There is no legal obligation on departments to transfer records to National Archives if they are under 30 years old. I want to reassure the noble Lord about his search of the Ministry of Transport records some time ago. Lessons have been learnt from that period and the care with which government departments maintain their records is at a higher standard than he may have witnessed when he examined the position some time ago.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08020568000026"></a>The House will be aware&#151;the noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred to this&#151;that the Prime Minister announced on 25 October last year that he had appointed an independent team led by Paul Dacre, the editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers Ltd and a member of the Press Complaints Commission, to review when government records are made available to the public. The review is focusing on whether, in the light of the Freedom of Information Act and other considerations, there should be any changes to the 30-year rule&#151;the time-span under which most public records are transferred to National Archives and made available to the public. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, identified areas where the 30-year rule needs to be looked at afresh. First, if one part of a story is released elsewhere somewhat earlier than the present 30 years, obvious questions are raised about impartial information being in the public domain.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08020568000027"></a>Secondly, with careers lasting longer and people living longer, the 30-year limit raises significant issues about individuals&#146; sensitivity when information is released for which they are either directly responsible or identified in a particular role. Therefore, these matters need to be looked at afresh and I assure the House that that is what the review is intended to do. Although the noble Lord, Lord McNally, ended by giving an encomium to Paul Dacre, I think he recognises that, with his background in the newspaper industry, he has at least a real concern for the immediacy and relevance of information, and that makes him an excellent appointment to the role.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08020568000028"></a>Within each department, a departmental record officer is responsible for the care of all the records, which in recent years has inevitably included an increasing number of electronic records. Each departmental record officer&#146;s work on public records is carried out under the guidance and supervision of expert staff at National Archives. The National Archives team takes a strategic role and supports the department in its operational work. At a strategic level, National Archives agrees with each department which records need to be kept  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1023"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1023</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for long-term preservation and access via a published document&#151;the operational selection policy. At an operational level, it advises and helps the departmental record officers in selecting records for permanent preservation at National Archives in line with this policy, in creating search aids to the records, and in ensuring that the records are prepared and transferred to the correct archival standard. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will appreciate the extent to which intensive rigour is applied to the processing of departmental records and the role which National Archives plays in supervising that work.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08020568000029"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Bew, indicated, the Freedom of Information Act has made the Government more accountable than ever for the proper management of information. Section 46 of the Act requires the Lord Chancellor to issue a code of practice on the management of records. This was published in November 2002 and came into effect on 1 January 2005. It is in two parts. Part 1 covers record management and part 2 covers the review and transfer of public records. The code applies to all central government departments and public record bodies. That is an important derivative from the Freedom of Information Act which conditions, in a way vastly different from in past decades, the ways in which departments now and in the future will need to address themselves to the question of records. Last year, National Archives launched information management assessments designed to raise the capability and awareness of the Government&#146;s management of their information and records. A department&#146;s compliance with the code is assessed within the overall departmental information management standards. The initial assessments completed last year have resulted in strong recommendations and actions for improving and supporting how departments manage their records and information. They have also enhanced the awareness of the importance of managing information and records across these departments.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08020568000030"></a>National Archives is also supporting the Government to help capture and maintain vital information for the development of guidance on the tools for proper information management. With the increasing number of electronic records, for example, National Archives is taking forward a pan-government shared services project, the digital continuity project, which aims to deliver a shared service across government to ensure the survival and accessibility of digital information. I hope that, in this section, I have been able to demonstrate to the noble Lord, with his well founded anxieties, that the arrangements are in place for capturing and maintaining government archives&#151;and perhaps more importantly, that the initiatives being introduced will ensure that we guarantee the survival of today&#146;s information for tomorrow.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08020568000031"></a>I turn to the noble Lord&#146;s second consideration, the Government&#146;s official history programme. I confess that I have a great deal in common with the noble Lord, Lord McNally. I too studied history at University College under Professor Joel Hurstfield. I too played in the parliamentary football team. The only difference between us is that I have continued to vote Labour and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has gone a different route. But, in every other respect, he knows only too well that I understand and follow his  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1024"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1024</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>great interest in these matters. I am very appreciative of the fact that he has addressed the question of the official histories this evening, as did the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08020568000032"></a>We recognise that the present arrangements with the Whitehall History Publishing group&#151;which have been in place since 1999 and the contract runs till 2010&#151;are with the Routledge arm of Taylor &amp; Francis. In the past it has proved both efficient and cost effective to have all the histories published this way. The contract requires no expenditure by the partners of the Whitehall histories group and they receive a proportion of the royalties from sales to help offset the costs. However, I bear in mind what the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, said and I think he was buttressed by the noble Lord, Lord McNally&#151;I am not so sure that the noble Lord, Lord Bew, did not also cast a glance in this direction&#151;that the official histories perhaps need to be marketed more successfully.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08020568000033"></a>I cannot give much help as far as my noble friend Lord Evans of Temple Guiting is concerned. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, might have just forgotten that he has moved out of publishing and into banking. We all know what has happened to banking since the noble Lord, Lord Evans, has appeared in that quarter. Suffice it to say, we should certainly look at marketing. There is no doubt that we want the official histories to be written to the very highest standards and they will be inevitably costly. History books are costly, as all Members of the House will know. It is also the case that if we are to see a wider public enjoy a set of books, we must be careful to avoid prohibitive prices. The marketing aspect of the official histories may need to be looked at with some constructive care.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08020568000034"></a>I would like to clarify the difference between the official history programme, which is run from within the Cabinet Office, and the internal histories, which are the work of other departments, notably the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence. The Cabinet Office is responsible for managing all the official histories and the official history programme, but both the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as noble Lords will know, publish histories which relate to work of their departments.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08020568000035"></a>I am all too well aware that my responses to this debate are bound to be inadequate against the background of the highly specialised expertise which has been brought to the debate, but I want to answer certain questions before I conclude. I was very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Luke, for introducing into the debate something I had not anticipated, and ought to have done knowing his interest in this area. It was very useful indeed to have a relationship to the archives of Parliament and the work that is done here. They are also quite unique and it is important that they are valued too. He was emphatic about the good work that is being done in this area, but of course no one should rest on their laurels on these issues.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08020568000036"></a>I say in passing that about the only feature of my education in history at University College that paid direct and immediate dividends related to the fact that, when I became secretary of the Parliamentary  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1025"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1025</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Labour Party in 1979, I discovered that every single record of the history of the PLP, going right through the resignation of Oswald Mosley, the election of Clynes in 1922 and the General Strike, was handwritten on foolscap paper pushed into loose-leaf folders. I managed to get that put into some permanent position on microfiche; the records are now in the Museum of Labour History in Manchester. That just shows that, even with the most redundant of students, Professor Hurstfield could strike a chord at least in one respect to the benefit of historians.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08020568000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, indicated that he thought that the official histories were at times a somewhat odd mixture. As they were drawn up from suggestions across Whitehall, there will be a certain idiosyncrasy to them. The whole question of which topics should be covered is a thorny one. Suffice it to say that steps are being taken to tap into external advice as well. After all, the histories are written by outside historians&#151;by definition, academic historians&#151;so it is only right that we should take greater steps to take their advice on the compilation of the histories.</p>

<a name="80205-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08020568000038"></a>I have come to the end of my time before answering every question in the detail that I would have wished. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, that I will write to him where I have failed to answer his specific questions. On the more general issues that have been raised this evening, all noble Lords have made it clear that we need to address ourselves with considerable care both to the archives and to the official histories. I assure the House that constructive concepts are in place. There is an openness to learn from others on how we can improve on past performance. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, for giving us the opportunity to air these issues this evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08020568000045"></a>As an indication of the extent of the problem: in 2005-06, 5,280 children under the age of 16 were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related reasons; in 2006-07 that figure had risen to 6,707. We agree that the intoxicating substance treatment retirement, which can be imposed in connection with a youth rehabilitation order, is a necessary addition to Schedule 1. But we are concerned about whether the facilities to deliver this treatment will be available; whether they will be professionally validated and whether the courts will have the expertise to make decisions on detox and rehabilitation, which may well require different facilities.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08020568000046"></a>The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse has published a review of the effectiveness of treatment for alcohol problems, and the noble Baroness, Lady Richardson, in her introduction, says that there is compelling evidence for investment in alcohol treatment, but that it is essential that it should be directed towards interventions of proven effectiveness. Last October the NTA told the <I>Observer</I> that the number of young people in contact with alcohol treatment agencies rose from 5,200 in 2005-06 to 6,707 the following year, so there is undoubtedly a growing demand. Yet there seems to be no strategy to provide the facilities that are needed; indeed, establishments are being closed. I was told that Phoenix Futures, for instance, is just about to close one of its residential establishments&#151;or has just about done so. Nor does there seem to be any authority to validate the treatment to be provided under the orders. The Commission for Social Care Inspection, which registers residential establishments, has no expertise on the quality of the treatment offered.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08020568000047"></a>Presumably, the treatment specified in the order will sometimes, if not generally, be residential, but those facilities are few and far between. In the light of the debate on the previous amendment, which the Minister resisted because it applied only in cases where a young person would be compelled to leave their home, I would be grateful if, when replying to this amendment, the Minister would say something about whether these alcohol treatments would invariably be non-residential. If not, the same arguments apply as they did to the previous amendment.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08020568000048"></a>I beg leave to doubt whether, in every case, the treatment of severe alcohol problems can be done on a non-residential basis. In the provision of those facilities, there is inadequate co-ordination between PCTs and local authorities. In the new NHS operational plan for 2008-09 to 2010-11, there is nothing specific about alcohol treatment. If the orders are to work, they need to be embedded in a proper strategic framework with adequate funding and with professional validation of the facilities to be developed. I beg to move.</p>

I base that on my experience visiting young offenders. One was horrified at how many of them had alcohol problems recorded as being part of the problem and yet alcohol treatment was not part of the treatment that they were getting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08020568000050"></a>It has always struck me as unfortunate that there seems to be a difference in the content between what is done during community sentences and what is done in custody. There are many things that could be the same. There is no reason why education, work training or drug treatment should not be part of a community sentence. There is certainly no reason why alcohol treatment should not be part of such a sentence. Therefore, I hope that the provisions that are so ably set out by the noble Lord are included in requirements both in custody and in this part of the Bill, which relates to what should be done in community for them, because it is a scourge that badly needs more attention.</p>

That is a very long and old English tradition. The Venerable Bede complained his monks getting too drunk. It is a very serious problem and it ought to be looked at against the drinking culture that the young of this country have had historically for thousands of years.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, has drawn attention to the dangers of women drinking in the early stages of their pregnancy. Having an alcoholic as a parent, or two alcoholics as parents, raises child protection concerns and often when the NSPCC looks into child abuse or maltreatment issues there are one or two alcoholic parents involved. If we can get in effectively early on, it would make so much difference to the lives of some of our most vulnerable children. Therefore, I welcome what is behind the amendment and look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="08020568000053"></a><b><a name="80205-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08020568000216"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> The British Crime Survey states that alcohol is a factor in no less than 47 per cent of violent crime. That breaks down to 45 per cent of incidents of domestic violence, 58 per cent of incidents of stranger violence and 51 per cent of incidents of acquaintance violence. It is central to violent offending.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08020568000054"></a>All that the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, are seeking to do is to put the treatment of alcohol-driven offences by young offenders on the same basis as alcohol-driven offences by adults.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08020568000055"></a>A recent survey suggests that alcohol treatment funding made up only 6 per cent of the funding that drug treatment services receive. If that is an accurate statistic, it is an astonishing one. We know that drugs play an important role, particularly in theft and burglary. Nevertheless, it is violent crime that is most disturbing the general public&#151;and, indeed, the Government&#151;and it is plain that alcohol is a major cause.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08020568000056"></a>The amendments will involve resources, but I think they will be resources exceedingly well spent to try and contain that problem. I will be most interested to hear the Government&#146;s response.</p>

What the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said about getting in early is obviously right as well.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08020568000058"></a>As to whether these treatments take place in residential or non-residential settings, I do not think it will surprise the noble Lord to hear that in the great majority of cases, alcohol treatment requirements are discharged in a non-residential setting. Treatment is mostly provided on a voluntary basis. As to whether substance misuse treatment is currently available for young offenders, the answer is yes. Since 2004-05, all youth offending teams have been screening young offenders for substance misuse, ensuring that those with identified need receive assessment and the appropriate intervention. Interventions can be different&#151;they include prevention or early intervention, which comes under what is described as tier 2, or specialist treatment under tiers 3 and 4. The majority of young offenders receiving treatment for substance misuse&#151;that phrase includes alcohol misuse, because the Bill makes it clear that the two are treated under the heading of substance misuse&#151;access services on a voluntary basis via provision commissioned locally, and I shall say something about resources before I sit down. However, although drug treatment and testing is available as a court order, the court does not currently have power to order treatment for alcohol or other substance misuse such as glue, aerosols and petrol. The new requirement will plug this gap.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08020568000059"></a>Let me help the Committee by giving some figures. In 2004-05, 12,885 young offenders received an assessment, 7,672 received the early intervention under tier 2, and 2,973 received specialist treatment under tiers 3 and 4. By 2006-07, 13,373 young offenders were receiving assessment, an increase of about 500; 7,915 were receiving intervention, an increase of 250; and 4,823 were receiving the more specialist treatment. Those figures are of interest to the Committee, and there are others as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08020568000062"></a>Amendment No. 19 would significantly narrow who could direct this treatment by making them effectively subject to approval by the Royal College of Physicians. Amendment No. 20 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, would place a duty on the Secretary of State to maintain a central list of facilities offering this treatment to make such a list available to the courts. We do not believe that either of the amendments are appropriate, and I shall explain why.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1029"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1029</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80205-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08020568000063"></a>We believe that restricting those who can direct intoxicating substance treatment only to those persons who have been approved by the Royal College of Physicians is, frankly, not practical. Such a restriction does not reflect entirely the context in which such treatment is delivered. In drafting the requirement in the Bill, we have worked closely with both the Department of Health and the National Treatment Agency. Their advice is that dependency on intoxicating substances can be resolved in a treatment intervention, as it is called, where the main worker does not have to be a medical practitioner.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08020568000064"></a>Such a narrowly defined treatment provider would not allow the sort of flexibility required in the provision of this treatment. In some cases, frankly, the people providing the treatment will not have formal qualifications. For example, there may be instances where the treatment could be delivered by a person who has the necessary experience through their own previous experience of addiction. Everyone knows that those who have previous experience of wrongdoing or addiction are sometimes the very best at winning others away from addiction. For young people, such personal experience can provide&#151;and this is my point&#151;some of the most powerful testimony on the dangers of addiction to substances. They are not, I am afraid, liable to approval by the Royal College of Physicians.</p>

<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="08020568000065"></a><b><a name="80205-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08020568000220"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I listened to that explanation with great interest and I absolutely agree. The same is true for drug workers, but is it not better when they are under the supervision of somebody who is qualified to see that what they are doing is part of a structured regime?</p>

<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="08020568000066"></a><b><a name="80205-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08020568000221"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am not sure that I agree that they are necessarily better under someone who, for example, was approved by the Royal College of Physicians, but there clearly has to be a supervisory structure. It is very important that all people in that structure are of high quality, but we do not want to limit those people to any particular qualification.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08020568000067"></a>The current wording of the requirement emphasises that the treatment worker must have necessary qualifications or experience to direct treatment. This offers sufficient safeguards to ensure that treatment is directed by someone suitable for the role. However, I go back to the flexibility that is vital to ensure that a young person receives the sort of treatment that is tailored to their individual needs and circumstances. In case there are any doubting voices still around, this wording is consistent with the drug treatment requirement in paragraph 22 of Schedule 1 to the Bill, and the adult drug rehabilitation requirement in Section 209 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. It is also endorsed by both the Department of Health and the National Treatment Agency.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08020568000068"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 20. The proposed requirement on the Secretary of State to maintain a central list of facilities does not reflect the fundamentally decentralised arrangements for the delivery and funding of this treatment. Youth offending teams are referring  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1030"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column 1030</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>young people to these services already. Indeed, the majority of young offenders who receive treatment for substance misuse access those services voluntarily. We anticipate that very few young people who have failed to engage with such treatment voluntarily will require a court order. Both funding and provision are devolved locally. Young people&#146;s specialist substance misuse treatment services are currently funded via the National Treatment Agency. Provision is commissioned locally and youth offending teams are the largest commissioner of these services. It is the role of the local youth offending team to identify local facilities and providers, and to establish whether the services provided are appropriate for the young person subject to the order.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08020568000069"></a>Information about suitable treatment services and facilities for a young person will be provided to the court as part of the pre-sentence report process, on which sentencing decisions will be made. The court will, therefore, receive the necessary information about the facilities being recommended through this process. A centrally held list of facilities will not add much value&#151;perhaps a little, but not much. Indeed, a list would be unworkable and difficult to maintain to an appropriate level of accuracy. Because the treatment services are delivered locally, the maintenance of a central list would be overly bureaucratic and liable to be out of date quickly as treatment providers change over time. We believe that we have provided an appropriate framework in the Bill to ensure the effective delivery of the intoxicating substance treatment requirement and we accept absolutely the unanimous view of the committee that this is an important area.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08020568000070"></a>I said that I would say a little more about resources. Alcohol treatment and general programmes to counter the misuse by young offenders that we are talking about in these amendments are included in general youth offending team work on substance misuse. Funding is received through the young people&#146;s substance misuse grant and through local drug action teams&#146; and children&#146;s services. Youth offending teams will normally engage young people voluntarily in substance misuse treatment without the need to resort to a specific court order. Our view is that very few young people will ever need alcohol or other substance misuse treatment as a requirement within a youth rehabilitation order.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08020568000071"></a>I hope that that answers the various issues that have been raised. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has indicated his concern as to whether what we are proposing will require further funding. Not all YOTs are funded to provide substance misuse workers to support screening, early intervention and referral to specialist services. As I have said, young people&#146;s specialist substance misuse treatment services are currently funded via the National Treatment Agency&#146;s pooled treatment budget which is included in the young people&#146;s substance misuse partnership grant. Local children&#146;s and young people&#146;s partnerships are expected to play their part in ensuring that children and young people can access the full range of treatment modalities as outlined in the National Treatment Agency guidance. In practice, young people subject to this requirement will also be accessing services provided by this funding arrangement.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08020568000072"></a>I invite the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Surely if someone is getting into trouble because they are slightly inebriated, and that is part of the cause of the violence or robbery, is it not something which must be addressed? Have I misunderstood the noble Lord, or has he said that this would not be part of a youth rehabilitation order? If so, it seems to be upside down.</p>

The vast majority will continue to be voluntary on the basis that young people are picked up before they have committed the type of offence which requires a youth rehabilitation order and so will be dealt with voluntarily. When this provision becomes part of the Act in due course, there will be cases when it is appropriate that a youth rehabilitation order should have such a direction in it, but our belief is that that will not arise very often.</p>

If a young person is drunk when they commit an offence, it would be crazy not to make it compulsory for someone to try to get it into that person&#146;s pea-sized brain that getting sloshed causes trouble. It is something that that person should be educated about . This is what I find so odd. The idea that these young people are going to volunteer to be taught about alcohol seems slightly crazy.</p>

Listening to the Minister, I have the impression that there is no framework at all. Who can set up these facilities? It would appear that any ex-alcoholic or even current alcoholic can do so. How is the court to know what places are available? Will the youth offending team go around trying to find a place with someone offering these services and include it in the pre-sentence report? How is it to be funded? We are not sure. It certainly is not a part of the youth offending team&#146;s budget apparently and will come from somewhere else. The Minister is suggesting a ramshackle structure for the carrying out of these orders, not the tightly controlled suggestion made by my noble friend.</p>

<a name="80205-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08020568000077"></a>Furthermore, it is a little excessive if the criticism is that my noble friend is calling for a centralised list. As I understand the amendment, he is calling for the Secretary of State to make sure that there is a list, but it will not have to be centralised in London and made available nationally. It can be devolved via the Secretary of State to the local area so that it is available to the magistrates&#146; court faced with a sentencing problem. I would have thought the Government would have tried to get this into a better framework than that which has been suggested so far.</p>

It was not one that I talked about so I am very surprised at someone as experienced as he putting those words into my mouth. I wonder why he did it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08020568000083"></a>Let me try again. It is worth considering the treatment requirements attached to the YRO within this context: they will be subject to the same considerations on availability and suitability as are applicable outside of the criminal justice system. However&#151;and this is the important point&#151;in practice, most young offenders with identified drug substance misuse or mental health treatment needs will receive treatment on a voluntary basis, supported by appropriate workers in youth offending teams. We expect that that treatment of these needs would be included as a part of a court order only when a young person had previously failed to engage with treatment services and when drug substance misuse or mental health had been identified as a factor in offending behaviour&#151;for instance, committing crime in order to support drug substance use or while under the influence of drugs or intoxicating substances. Consequently the expectation is that there will only ever be a small number of young people who will require a court order to undertake treatment. We are confident that the availability of treatment should be sufficient to cater for those young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08020568000084"></a>Youth offending teams will know of providers in local areas and supervise any treatment. I have said more than once that the funding is provided by the National Treatment Agency. If alcohol addiction is the cause of the offence for which the YRO is given, the court can give that requirement. The fact is that YOTs are giving alcohol treatment without recourse to a court order as part of their general work on substance misuse. All YOTs are funded to provide substance misuse workers and we believe, as does the Youth Justice Board, that only very few require court orders for substance treatment. If they require orders they will be given them, but just because an offence is committed by someone in drink, it does not follow

There is a whole sequence of other orders that may be more suitable. For the noble Earl, who knows better than this, to suggest that everyone who is drunk and is brought before the court, even if they have committed an offence of violence, should necessarily get one of these orders attached to a YRO is frankly absurd.</p>

The figure of 13,000 which I gave earlier was for those who had done so. Many of them do it voluntarily; many, it is to be hoped, are cured by doing it. The Bill will make provision for part of an order to contain a treatment direction as well, but it is not right to laugh out of court the voluntary nature of some of the work that is being done on the people to whom we are referring. There are other directions that can be imposed under the order. It may be expected of people that they will go along voluntarily to have their alcoholism, or whatever their condition is, cured. There may therefore have been a misunderstanding.</p>

The first is that the Government seem to be being inconsistent. They say that the voluntary nature of the scheme works, yet in many other parts of the Bill, and in the clauses on prostitution in which I shall take particular interest, there is no question of the requirements being voluntary&#151;indeed, prostitutes face detention if they do not comply with their orders. But for one of the biggest social ills facing the country, that of alcoholism in young people and the consumption of alcohol, voluntary treatment is OK. The second reason is that the Minister gave an insufficient assurance in his reply that either good guidance or a framework will be provided.

I therefore concede that the noble Lord is halfway down the track. Still, I ask what many young people would rather do: would they rather go and be lectured by a reformed alcoholic, employed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, or go down the pub to drink illegally? The answer in the case of a lot of people is probably the latter. Even though voluntarism is better, it is to those people that one has to apply some pressure.</p>

So voluntarism is essential to the first stage in looking at people who come into the criminal justice system or the health system as a result of the consumption of alcohol.

The Minister has explained that, while we have always had drug treatment orders, this brings alcohol into line for the first time. I applaud that principle; but then we have to look at the way in which alcohol and drugs treatment are each funded and ask whether that is commensurate with the damage caused by alcohol and drugs within

The noble Lord did not comment on my reference to the <I>Review of the Effectiveness of Treatment of Alcohol Problems</I> just published by the National Treatment Agency. Clearly it knows a lot about how this works. If that review has taken the trouble to look at the problem and to comment on the effectiveness of treatment, surely that should be fed into the system and we should not have PCTs or local authorities going off and doing their own thing in a manner that is not consistent with an overall strategy.</p>

Unless the Crown Court originally imposed the order and the magistrates&#146; court then considered that the breach warranted revocation of the order and resentencing of the young person, the youth or magistrates&#146; court should deal with the breach. The current arrangements are that proceedings for breach of community orders made against children and young people commence in the youth court if they are under 18 or the adult magistrates&#146; court if they are over 18. However, if the order was originally imposed in the Crown Court, the powers of the lower court are limited. Where the breach is such that the youth or magistrates&#146; court considers that the order should be revoked and the young person resentenced, then of course the case must be referred to the Crown Court. But national standards require that court proceedings are initiated for a third unacceptable failure to attend an appointment within a 12-month period. Frequently, breach action does not imply that the young person is making no effort to comply with the order. For instance, a young person on a standard six-month supervision order might keep more than 90 per cent of his or her appointments and still qualify for breach action. In many cases, the most appropriate course for the court is to allow the order to continue, perhaps with some additional punishment. At present, no cases of this sort would be heard in the Crown Court, even if the original order had been made there. However, the Bill provides that where a youth rehabilitation order is imposed in the Crown Court, subsequent breach proceedings should automatically commence in that court, unless the judge at the sentencing hearing specifically ordered that any further proceedings should be in a youth or other magistrates&#146; court. This provision would inevitably lead to a substantial rise in the number of young people processed for breach in the Crown Court, including a significant number whose compliance is such that revocation of the order is not required.</p>

<a name="80205-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08020568000113"></a>My concerns about the current proposals are as follows. It would be a disproportionately inefficient use of resources to increase the number of breach cases that are automatically dealt with by the Crown Court. The Bill as drafted would inevitably increase the workload of the Crown Court and lead to delays, when relatively minor breaches could better be dealt with in the youth court. Crown Court proceedings are confusing and intimidating, and unjustified for children when no resentencing is required. Finally, the trial of children in an adult court it is in contravention of Article 30 of CRC, which states that the system for dealing with children should be distinct from that for adults. The UK has been criticised consistently for our provisions and the current proposals still would not comply with our obligations. </p>

<a name="80205-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08020568000114"></a>These amendments would ensure that proceedings for breach of a YRO would always start in the youth or adult magistrates&#146; court, as they do now for breach of a community sentence. They would not, however, affect the authority of the Crown Court in serious instances of non-compliance, where revocation is appropriate and the young person is to be resentenced. It would be more suitable in every way if all lesser cases were dealt with in the youth or magistrates&#146; court. I beg to move.</p>

However, I do not know very much about the normal processes here; I am simply giving a couple of examples that may be helpful. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

As we understand them, the amendments aim to take away from the Crown Court the power to deal with a breach initially and ensure that all proceedings for a breach where the offender is under 18 are commenced in the youth court. These are very important issues and we need to get them right so that the youth rehabilitation order establishes itself as a robust community sentence which enjoys public confidence.</p>

<a name="80205-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08020568000118"></a>We note the general desire to restrict the role of the Crown Court in the breach process. However, we believe that we need the flexibility provided in the Bill to allow cases to be transferred to the appropriate court for the breach to be dealt with proportionately. Where a Crown Court has sentenced a young offender to a youth rehabilitation order, I believe it is appropriate and sensible for the Crown Court to have the power to refer any breach or other proceedings back to the youth court.</p>

<a name="80205-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08020568000119"></a>The most serious cases involving young people are heard before the Crown Court. Examples of offences where a juvenile can be dealt with by the Crown Court are homicide or very serious offences where an adult would be liable to a maximum sentence of 14 years&#146; imprisonment or more, where a young offender is assessed as dangerous and has been convicted of a sexual or violent offence listed in Schedule 15 to the 2003 Act, or where a young person is jointly charged with an adult.</p>

<a name="80205-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08020568000120"></a>If the offence warranted being tried in the Crown Court because of its seriousness and the youth rehabilitation order had been breached on several occasions&#151;the noble Baroness will know better than I do about the warnings set out in the Bill, which we will debate shortly&#151;or there had been one serious breach, it would be right for this to be brought back

I rely for that argument on the excellent speech in Committee of the honourable Member in another place, Mr Burrowes, who is on the opposition Front Bench. He said about cases of young persons coming before a Crown Court:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="08020568000191"></a>&#147;Naturally any such case is serious and should only exceptionally be dealt with using a youth rehabilitation order, so we are talking about the exceptional cases that can be dealt with in the community, rather than about someone who has been convicted of a serious offence and dealt with by imprisonment&#148;. </p>
</ul>
<a name="80205-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08020568000121"></a>No doubt speaking for his party he says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="08020568000192"></a>&#147;We are concerned that in such cases the sentencer should have full control of the order and be involved in its enforcement. We therefore welcome Paragraph 35 which gives the Crown court direct discretion and allows it to be involved in the order&#146;s enforcement&#148;.</p>

A young offender may have been dealt with by the Crown Court as a co-defendant of an adult, or another juvenile being dealt with for a more serious offence. Where the Crown Court has made a Youth Rehabilitation Order for the young person, then it might, depending on the circumstances, be entirely proportionate and reasonable for the Crown Court to direct that any further breach proceedings should be dealt with in the youth court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08020568000124"></a>It is clearly preferable, in these circumstances, that the Crown Court should have the power to direct that the youth court deal with any proceedings that may arise as a result of breach. Also, the youth court retains the right to refer cases back to the Crown Court, where they deem that the case warrants the more onerous sentencing powers of the higher courts. We have given the Crown Courts this power because we think it would be disproportionate in every instance to retain the case in the Crown Court and impose an unnecessary burden on that higher court. We accept that youth courts have the expertise in dealing with young people. Where the Crown Court wishes to refer the matter to the youth court to deal with, it is right that it should have the power to do so. We also believe it right that the Crown Court retains the power to have breach proceedings brought back before it where it may have taken a risk in making a Youth Rehabilitation Order for a very serious offence. Amendment No. 33 would remove the power to amend the Youth Rehabilitation Order on breach and restrict the youth court to either imposing a fine or resentencing</p>

It is a matter of dealing with breaches where the matter is not so serious, retaining it within the ambit of the youth or magistrates&#146; court&#151;where it could be more appropriately dealt with&#151;as well as relieving the Crown Court of what is otherwise a matter which should not necessarily detain it.</p>

<ul>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08020568000133"></a>The noble Lord said: National standards for breach proceedings require the responsible officers to issue warnings for unreasonable instances of non-compliance and to initiate breach proceedings where there are three unreasonable failures within a 12-month period. Currently, there is discretion to depart from this in exceptional cases and with the authorisation of the youth offending team manager. The Bill removes that discretion.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08020568000134"></a>What evidence is there that this change is necessary? Statistics suggest that youth offending teams already take non-compliance very seriously. Between 2000 and 2004, for instance, the proportion of supervision orders returned to court for breach action rose from 7 per cent to 21 per cent. It is not accordingly clear that there is any need to legislate to make enforcement of orders a statutory duty.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08020568000135"></a>I suggest to the Minister that these provisions are damaging in a number of respects. First, they potentially harm the relationship between the YOT staff and the offender. Effective work with young people in trouble is dependent on the establishment of a good relationship between the staff and the young people for whom they have supervisory responsibility. Secondly, the change will lead to a significant increase in court workload, with no evidence of any corresponding advantage. Thirdly, it will lead to court appearances in many circumstances where an offender is genuinely trying to comply but is failing. Fourthly, it will inevitably lead to an increase in the number of children in custody. Fifthly, it will reduce or expunge entirely a number of innovative practices that have grown on the flexibility of the current rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08020568000136"></a>Moreover, the Bill will lead to the anomaly of YROs being subject to statutory breach but reparation orders and post-custody supervision for detention and training orders continuing to be governed by national

I am not sure whether I understood the Minister&#146;s gesture, but I would be grateful for a response. The concerns that I expressed hold here, too, and I would like reassurance that there will be sufficient flexibility. For instance, if a child has a bereavement or his parents separate, there should be flexibility to enable a discussion in which people can say, &#147;Your behaviour has deteriorated. Why? What&#146;s going on here? Is it necessary for us to come down very hard?&#148;.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08020568000139"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for putting his important points so succinctly. This is an issue on which we disagree, as I think was shown in the debate in another place. I shall try to explain why. We think that placing national standards for breaches on the face of the Bill is important to ensure that everyone&#151;courts, young people, sentencers and the general public&#151;is aware of the standards that apply to community orders and the consequences of inappropriate behaviour. If there were no flexibility in these standards, the noble Lord would have a strong point, but I argue that the degree of flexibility answers his concerns.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08020568000140"></a>Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="08020568000196"></a>&#147;If the responsible officer is of the opinion that the offender has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with the youth rehabilitation order, the responsible officer must give the offender warning&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020568000175"></a>It follows that if there is a reasonable excuse, he does not have to give the offender a warning.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08020568000141"></a>The Bill sets a limit of two formal warnings that may be issued to a young offender in a 12-month period following which, on a third breach in that period, proceedings must be instituted. I repeat that a warning cannot be given unless there is an unreasonable breach. It also allows for immediate court action to be taken by the responsible officer when the breach is so serious that it warrants immediate court action. I do not think that anyone would disagree with that.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08020568000142"></a>The provisions reflect the current national standards of the Youth Justice Board for breaches. They are in the Bill as clear evidence&#151;this is important to the public&#151;that breaches will be pursued vigorously and a consistent standard applied nationally. It was only a few weeks ago when a colleague of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in another place, the honourable Edward Leigh, in his capacity as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee said something that was quoted in the newspapers. The <I>Times</I> states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="08020568000197"></a>&#147;Too often offenders who have been given a community order are escaping elements of their punishment and rehabilitation. This is because the Probation Service, which manages offenders

In fact, the service does not know how many orders have not been completed, nor how many offenders break the terms of their orders&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08020568000143"></a>We do not have to agree with Mr Leigh, but that is what he in his important position said, and it may be, unless we are careful, what the general public begin to feel.

Mr Edward Leigh was obviously pointing to a failure of the system, but the Minister seems to be attributing the flexibility in the system as the reason, which we all want to keep, when it is the system that does not work. I imagine that it is the Government&#146;s responsibility to make the system work, and not necessarily to use a sledgehammer to change the law to make it work. The law is there and we believe that it works. If it is not working because certain parts of the executive agencies are not working, that problem must be resolved. It is counterintuitive.</p>

The muddle goes away by getting people to get their act together. The noble Lord was admitting that acts were not got together. The noble Baroness was saying exactly what I am saying, although she did so in possibly rather more delicate and refined terms&#151;that if something is not working, the Government should not immediately rush to the statute book to change it. One of their faults is that they have been doing that for 10 years. They should get the system to work before changing the law.</p>

That is what we do by writing it into the Bill, so that everyone knows where they stand. We are determined to ensure that the youth rehabilitation order and, indeed, all community penalties, are rigorously enforced, as we are determined to ensure that they are widely used by the courts. We want them to be widely used by the courts and accepted as robust by the public, as do the noble Earl and the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08020568000150"></a>It is often a challenge for some young people to comply with some of the most basic elements of a community order&#151;the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, made that point clearly&#151;such as being somewhere at a set time. That is recognised in the flexibility allowed for in the breach process, as the responsible officer makes the decision about what is a reasonable excuse. That allows that officer to take account of the young person&#146;s age and maturity. It also allows the officer to take into consideration the fact that the young person may be dependent on a third party&#151;for example, a parent&#151;to get them to an appointment. I assure the Committee that our expectations are that current practice, as governed by national standards, will and should remain unchanged.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08020568000151"></a>Youth Justice Board national standards provide more detailed guidance to responsible officers to help them assess what is a reasonable excuse. We all know that there has to be a balance between enforcement and local management discretion, especially where young people are concerned, but action must be taken where the breaches can no longer be considered as minor infringements&#151;where there is no reasonable cause for them.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08020568000152"></a>This is not about alarm clocks failing to be set at the right time for an early appointment; this is not about a young person missing an appointment because he or she is in hospital; this is not about punishing young people because their parent or guardian could not or would not drive them to an appointment. This is about those occasions where a young person refuses to engage with the terms of their order. That is why local discretion is built into the procedure. Local youth offending team workers will remain responsible for the orders. It is they who know how best to manage compliance based on a number of factors which need to be taken into account, and they will have the knowledge of the young person for whom they are responsible.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08020568000153"></a>Our case is that we must ensure that there is a common procedure which is clear and transparent to all. We are satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to avoid young offenders being returned to court for minor infringements, and we believe it right and appropriate that a clear standard be set out in the Bill on when breach action must be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08020568000154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said that he believed that that would inevitably result in more court appearances and more young people remanded in custody. All that the breach arrangements do is codify existing national standards. We do not expect there to be any change to existing practice. As I have repeated several times, the arrangements allow for reasonable excuse, which can be taken into account. Therefore, we do not expect the result of including

<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08020568000159"></a>I am very much in debt to the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, for two reasons. First, she felicitously explained that the community order system does not work at present for reasons that have nothing whatever to do with the flexibility of the way these breaches are approached. I cannot for the life of me see how the change that the Government are proposing in that context can change that underlying and melancholy fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08020568000160"></a>I am also in her debt for bringing out a point that was made earlier during our debate on the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, to which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, rightly reflected, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, had assented&#151;that the Government are committed to using custody as a last resort. In the course of that debate, I remember saying to the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, that her amendment has to have bite; otherwise she will find that, however one can talk generally about the desirability of minimising custody, if one looks at the detail one will see that that principle is undermined at every turn. Here is a very good example of that principle being undermined, and the Government, despite their general concurrence with what the noble Baroness said, are the guilty party.</p>

However, I am concerned about the point that the noble Baroness made about informed consent and having been able to consult someone. That was one of my major worries during my time in tribunals. People set themselves up as &#147;employment consultants&#148;&#151;I suppose that I could describe them as cowboys. They found their clients the moment that the case was filed, because it is on public record. It used to be that if they went to Bury St Edmunds they could see the total case&#151;every word of it; now that it is all on line they can probably only get the name, address and contact. Even so, they then tout for business, and very often the person approached by those consultants has no idea that they are not an authority on anything and have no real experience or understanding of the case. We saw case after case in which self-appointed so-called experts did very badly for their clients. They were not legally qualified, but the person employing them had no idea whether they were or not. The legal qualification may not be so necessary&#151;and now these people are regulated. If you receive a fee, you are meant to be regulated. But there is still no way in which to confirm

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08020568000169"></a>That really concerns me. It is very important, with a proposal such as this one, in situations where people are relying on independent advice, that there should be a clear way in which to establish that the independent advice is at least soundly based.</p>

<a name="80205-0015.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08020568000171"></a>I shall make two points, first on Amendment No. 13 and then on Amendment No. 12. Amendment No. 13 should probably be couched in terms that an employee&#146;s consent is valid only when he or she has taken independent advice of someone with suitable qualifications. That appears elsewhere in employment law, but the thing has got so complicated these days that I could not find it in the Butterworth guide. Somewhere we have a definition of qualified advice for similar purposes, I am sure, and no doubt the Minister can tell me where it is. At any rate, Amendment No. 13 is much too modest and timid. An employee&#146;s consent should not be valid when he or she has just been leant on or advised by someone who is not at all competent to give the advice. Consent should be backed up by qualified independent advice&#151;and I am sure that we will look at that very carefully before Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08020568000172"></a>Amendment No. 12 is much more suitable to Committee. I just do not understand why lines 17 and 18 are in the Bill; the amendment suggests that they should be omitted. I refer to new subsection (3AA)(b), which tells us that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020568000198"></a>&#147;employment tribunal procedure regulations... may only authorise the determination of proceedings without any hearing... where&#151;</ul><ul><a name="08020568000199"></a>(a) all the parties to the proceedings consent&#148;&#151;</ul>

<p><a name="08020568000177"></a>I do not understand what that adds. When a party consents to the determination without a hearing, if properly couched, the paragraph would take effect; or each party has the right to request a hearing. It is always useful to turn it into a negative: when would the party not have the right to request a hearing? That is a very simple question, and there must be a simple answer which, in my present rather tired state, I have been unable to see. If there is no answer, the paragraph should be omitted because it does not add anything.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000010"></a>The noble Lord said: I am happy to open a new day in a new week in Committee by moving Amendment No. 67 which is tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Addington. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 73 to 75 and 85. This clutch of amendments makes any regulations relating to the new commission set up by the Bill subject to a formal reference to the child support advisory committee. The model is clear. Members of the Committee will be familiar with the work of the Social Security Advisory Committee, which has been an integral part of benefit law and policy making for many years. It provides a service by consulting on draft regulations that the department is bringing forward or which are in gestation within the department. It gives advice on those regulations, consults with stakeholders and produces conclusions that lead to a published report that is available to both Houses of Parliament when the regulations are debated. When I started to cut my teeth on social security legislation in an earlier incarnation in the House of Commons, it gave me considerable confidence that I had not completely missed the point when dealing with abstruse 90-minute debates on detailed technical regulations. For people who were coming to the subject for the first time, or who had some knowledge of a particular area but did not know the wider context of social security law, it was an invaluable aid that gave them&#151;not just me&#151;confidence that these were important matters of public policy.</p>

People get frightened by the technicalities of these important subjects. I point to the contributions that have been made during the passage of the Bill through both Houses. The number of people taking part in the debates is getting smaller, and the speakers who are not on the Public Bill Committee or party spokesmen could be numbered on the fingers of one hand. Therefore, there is value in having an independent interlocutor, without any axes to grind but with a great deal of expertise and knowledge in the field and access to a sophisticated network of stakeholders. That interlocutor can bring to bear corporate knowledge and experience built up over many years that shine light on and elucidate the finer points of some of the technical policy in the relegations. That will be the case when the commission is set up. It will set regulations. Indeed, the Minister has been hiding behind the commission with aplomb&#151;probably rightly in many cases because it will be left to the commission to be successful in its own way of doing things. But I think that the commission will need to bring forward regulations and the department will need to sponsor the regulations. I for one would have an awful lot more confidence to look at the regulations as they come through, affirmative or negative as they may be, if they came with the seal of approval of an equivalent to the Social Security Advisory Committee&#151;the child support advisory committee that would be set up in these amendments under consideration this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000014"></a>The other thing that a child support advisory committee would be able to do is to make occasional special reports, as of course the SSAC can and often does, to great effect. Those reports would be on subjects that the committee believed, having regard to its experience of oversight of policy, should be investigated. The SSAC did a very good report not that long ago about call centres and the problems for clients who accessed the benefits system via that route.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000015"></a>There are lots of advantages to a committee that has a closer and more confident relationship with the department than the rest of the outside world&#151;certainly opposition spokesmen&#151;may have. It can anticipate problems and call attention to them and service an extensive network of stakeholders. So the proposition in front of the Committee is clear: we are asking for further help from people who would make it their business to study the development of the policy and the implementation and operation of the new work of CMEC as a commission, and help Parliament to digest its requests for secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000016"></a>The idea is not new. It was mooted first by the then Social Security Select Committee in 1999 to 2000, in another place. There was an instructive recommendation in the 10th report, which came to the conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020561000380"></a>&#147;We recommend that the Government should consider either extending the terms of reference of the Social Security Advisory Committee, or creating a Child Support Advisory Committee on similar lines, to scrutinise secondary legislation on child support, as part of the process of building public confidence in the new child support system&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020561000367"></a>The Government of the day set their face against that. The main reason, in so far as I could understand any reason at all, was that it would delay things, get in the  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC497"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>way and take extra time&#151;and there was a general nuisance value to any such committee. They decided that it would just make things harder and that the department had enough trouble without that. It may well slow down deliberation and may from time to time make life a little difficult for policy makers in the department, but my submission is that the value added by any such committee would far outweigh any drawbacks of that kind.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000017"></a>Another thing that I could adduce in evidence in support of the case is that we are just beginning to understand how the Child Support Agency legislation is being interpreted by the courts. There are some cases that have gone all the way through the legal process. One was the Smith case, which went all the way through the courts, because of the ambiguities that existed in the primary and secondary legislation about whether capital allowance should be considered as assessable income. I am absolutely certain. Knowing what I do about the work done by the SSAC, I am absolutely certain that it would have picked up such an ambiguity before the case went anywhere near the Court of Appeal. The case cost a lot of time, money and agony for those involved in it. It is my submission that a committee set up to do that work would have signalled that potential fault and that it could have been addressed long before the difficulties that it caused.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000018"></a>I turn briefly to the content of the amendments. It is a professional cut-and-paste job. I have just lifted the Social Security Advisory Committee provisions but those provisions have two things to which I should point. First, the Secretary of State can always override them, as he can under the SSAC rules, in an emergency or with the agreement of the committee if something goes wrong that needs to be fixed quickly. You can worry about the detail of the argument later. That is an important safety provision. That is enshrined in these amendments.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000019"></a>If the new commission has any sense, it will encourage a network of stakeholders. There are plenty out there who I am sure are willing to help. It should seize the initiative and try to encourage them to come in. They could all play a part in the newly constituted committee that I recommend in this group of amendments. All the necessary groups are there and, I say in passing, particularly non-resident parents. I have been studying this area of public policy for as long as anyone and I know that there are organisations such as Fathers 4 Justice and so on which work very hard, but they have a much harder job making representations on behalf of that important client group. Any such committee set up under these amendments would play a prominent role, as far as I am concerned, in the makeup of the committee that did the work.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000020"></a>In conclusion, for the additional level of assurance and the future operation and delivery of the new commission, this is a small price to pay in terms of extra administration and such extra bureaucracy that might be involved. I think it would give assurance to the client group which studies this policy area and it would give reassurance to parliamentarians that, when considering the regulations, they would be able

On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000021"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08020561000449"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I do not know about other Members of the Committee, but ever since this Bill hit your Lordships' House for First Reading, I have been inundated with advice from all over the place. I think the Minister has held two, if not three, meetings on the Bill in my presence. Outside organisations are consistently giving me advice. Needless to say, I agree with some of the advice and not with the other, but that is beside the point&#151;the advice is there.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, wants to set up a new committee, a child support advisory committee, to give yet more specialist advice on the orders that will flow from time to time from this Bill. He made reference to the SSAC&#151;the Social Security Advisory Committee&#151;which already exists. I also noted the 10th report of the Select Committee in another place. My reaction is that it is one thing to extend the remit of the SSAC but quite another to set up a new and specialised committee. In this case, it is so specialised that half the time it will not be needed. There will be erratic need for advice to be given, as and when orders are proposed.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000023"></a>Another small, niggling point is that there is a provision in the rules governing the SSAC that, in normal circumstances, any order that flows from a Bill within six months of Royal Assent does not have to be referred to it unless the Secretary of State feels that there is a particular and peculiar need. I do not see that provision in this set of amendments, but I could have missed it.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000024"></a>The other thing is that of course I recognise that there may be occasions when it is necessary to override the SSAC and for the Secretary of State to do things so fast that there is not time to refer things to the committee, whether that is the committee that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, wants, or the SSAC. I recognise that he has incorporated that into the formulation for his new committee; but to have nine to 11 people sitting around waiting for something to happen&#151;I am afraid not.</p>

The SSAC does an extremely valuable job. The noble Lord is right that it normally comments on regulations after six months. The assumption is that within six months they come within the halo effect of parliamentary discussion. It is not dealing with an agency, so I would not think it appropriate to see the SSAC extending its remit to cover child support issues; they are a different sort of beast.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000026"></a>While it is highly desirable that the new Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission and the new chair seek to extend their remit, particularly if the new board is going to be very tightly drawn, as I understand it probably will be, is there a reason why they cannot do it as is? In other words, does this need

My hunch would be that this is the sort of thing on which the CMEC, being made up of good, sensible and competent people, will quickly determine whether it needs a wider circle of advice. My expectation is that it would want and need a wider circle of advice. Currently, the old Child Support Agency has the same wider circle of advice, involving groups such as Families Need Fathers. Is there any reason why it cannot be set up under the existing powers? I would be pretty unhappy about seeing such a prescriptive amendment being accepted. If my noble friend could give me the assurance that if the CMEC thinks that this is a wise move&#151;as I would expect it to seek to do&#151;it could do it, not just to deal with formal regulations, but to tap a wider body of opinion and views on child support as the context within which the new organisation operates and emerges.</p>

Perhaps I can start with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and my noble friend Lady Hollis. The noble Lord talked about the ethos of the DWP in consultation and engagement, and he expressed his view about the wide range of stakeholders around this issue with which he has had the opportunity to engage. I absolutely agree with that. Specifically in relation to the point raised by my noble friend Lady Hollis, I would have thought it would be entirely in the interests of the commission to want to have a wider stakeholder group with which to engage, perhaps on an ad hoc rather than a formalised basis, as suggested here. The DWP as the sponsoring department would similarly have its consultation with stakeholders. That is a particular reason why we do not want to accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, raises a fundamental point about the importance of effective scrutiny of legislation and having the appropriate body, whatever that may be, to assist in that. We honestly do not believe that the additional tier of scrutiny that the Child Support Advisory Committee would represent is necessary in this case. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, talked about the scale of issues in relation to the SSAC. Looking at its last report, the SSAC scrutinised on average 36 sets of proposed regulations. We set down in the dossier that we shared with Members who expressed an interest in this legislation the proposals for the earlier regulations that are coming through that have not yet been drafted, some of which will depend on the commission&#146;s input. Once we are in steady state, the advice is that the commission is likely to be looking to initiate something like two sets of miscellaneous regulations per year, and for two sets of such regulations we do not want the sort of infrastructure that is proposed here, with the number of people, staff and all the costs that go with that.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000029"></a>The vast majority of regulations in the Bill are certainly likely to be operational&#151;concerned with matters such as how cases will transfer to the new scheme, the formal content of notices, and deadlines for information to be provided to the commission.  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC500"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The people with the expertise to scrutinise them effectively are those with detailed knowledge of the operations of the commission, including, for example, the capability of IT systems and the interaction of overall plans and strategies. It is right that the Commission, as an arm&#146;s-length body solely focused on child maintenance issues, provides expert advice to Ministers on the policy behind the required regulations and the development of the regulations themselves.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000030"></a>That work will of course be subject to the overall direction and approval of the commission&#146;s board, including the non-executive directors. The non-executive directors are in place to provide impartial, expert and professional advice that reflects a diverse range of fields. In this way, they will have a key role in shaping the regulations. The chair of the commission, with approval of the Secretary of State, will appoint those non-executive directors with the appropriate knowledge and expertise. These will be people who are particularly able to take these regulation issues forward.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000031"></a>As we debated last week, it is clear that the board has the opportunity to set up committees and sub-committees so that it can draw in particular expertise for particular areas if it needs to. Nor should we forget the scrutiny of regulations already in place; not only the process by which there is an obligation to consult when regulations are being drafted, but also the role of the Merits Committee of your Lordships&#146; House. For that variety of reasons, this is an unnecessary proposal. It will not add sufficient value, and could be quite costly and cumbersome. There are better ways to continue to engage with stakeholders to ensure that the CMEC is engaged in a real success.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000032"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08020561000452"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I am not surprised by any of that, but I am disappointed. Two things strike me about what the Minister said. If he really believes&#151;and I do not&#151;that, in steady state, two regulations will be promoted by the commission a year, then there is an argument for adding it to the existing Social Security Advisory Committee. Its reason for not accepting the responsibility is that it would be too much work. Both these positions cannot be right. It may be that the committee is just ducking it because it is hard pressed, and it is. But if we are to have a steady state of two extra sets of regulations, it seems obvious to invite the committee to take this branch of semi-benefit law under its umbrella. It currently cannot because of how it is constituted and the provisions of its set-up. I will go away and contemplate, and perhaps talk to the Social Security Advisory Committee again. If its members could be persuaded that it would only be two sets of regulations a year, we might have a deal. I shall pursue that as a result of what the Minister has said.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000033"></a>The point that the Minister is missing, which the Committee must not miss, is that the value of what the Social Security Advisory Committee currently does is that it consults and publishes in the public domain. On websites, people can see what it says in detail. Any amount of stakeholder consultation that the commission does&#151;which I encourage it to do,

If this piece of public policy is going to take root and win public support, it should be much more broadly and widely promoted. The Social Security Advisory Committee, or some child support advisory committee, would be, in my view, an important part of that. On the basis that I will go away and think carefully about what the Minister has said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Section 46 is entitled &#147;Failure to comply with obligations imposed

<a name="80205-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000043"></a>Clause 12(2)(b) appears to reserve functions under Section 46 to the Secretary of State. Clearly, it is up to him to deem it right for people to be sanctioned by having their benefit withdrawn or reduced. I remember a discussion about this on the Welfare Reform Bill&#151;no doubt the Minister does too&#151;with which we had a happy time last year. This initial decision is taken under the powers of Section 6, not Section 46. Why is Section 6 not covered by Clause 12(2)(b). It may be that I have caused a slight fluttering in the doocot behind the Minister, but there must, I am sure, be a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000044"></a>The Minister might be tempted to point me to Clause 15 to show that my amendment is not necessary because Sections 46 and 6 are to be repealed by the Bill. But this is not going to happen straight away. In fact, as I understand the position, it may not happen for some considerable time. The Minister may be able to expand on the timescale if he has any more detail. It certainly will not happen on Royal Assent, but there will be an interim in which the situation prescribed in Clause 12 stands on the statute book. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000045"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08020561000455"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for giving me the opportunity to explain why Clause 12 is drafted as it is. The amendment would alter the transfer of functions under Clause 12, so that the commission becomes responsible for Section 46 of the Child Support Act 1991, and that functions under Section 6 would remain with the Secretary of State. I shall seek to explain how this is the wrong way round.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000046"></a>Section 46 of the 1991 Act provides that, if a parent with care in receipt of a prescribed benefit chooses to opt out of the statutory scheme without good cause, the Secretary of State may apply a reduced benefit decision, reducing the amount of benefit that the parent with care receives. Given that this relates entirely to decisions on the amount of benefit a person is to receive, and not to child support, it is right that the function should remain solely with the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000047"></a>Section 6, however, does relate to child support. It provides that a parent with care receiving prescribed benefits is automatically treated as having made an application for a maintenance calculation. As it falls to the Child Support Agency to handle such an application, this is a function which should be transferred to the commission. The transfer is achieved through Clause 12(1), and Schedule 3 makes the relevant modifications to the wording of the 1991 Act.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, identified why functions under Sections 6 and 46 need be considered at all, when they are to be repealed under Clause 15. In fact, the repeal of Sections 6 and 46 may not be effected until shortly after the launch of the commission and there would be a short intervening period during which it is important that responsibility for these functions falls to the appropriate body. As it stands, therefore, Clause 12 simply ensures that responsibility

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000049"></a>On our estimate on timing, assuming Royal Assent is as we would all want, it is currently anticipated that we are looking at July for dealing with the Section 6 compulsion for the flow on to the case load, but October for the start. The earlier date would be for the on-flow, as there is no point in insisting that people come in if within a few weeks they have the choice to stay out of the system. I hope that that has dealt clearly with the noble Lord&#146;s inquiry and he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This clause provides for TUPE transfer of CSA employees to the new commission. We have said all along that the people employed in the CSA are its biggest asset and would be critical in developing the modern service that needs to be put in place. I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that those people are moved across to provide the commission with a strong base on which it can build and to guarantee that there will be enough people to do the job from day one. However, as we discussed, following the amendment to give the commission Crown status, there is no longer a need for a TUPE transfer. Accordingly, I oppose the Question that Clause 13 shall stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000064"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 76 takes us on to another important aspect of the work of the commission. It relates to the information requirements; that is to say, the obligations to be imposed on the commission and on parents to supply information. My noble friend Lord Addington and I have tabled five of the amendments in this group and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has tabled two important amendments on the same kind of territory.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000065"></a>I shall start by making the case and asking a few probing questions about the quarterly financial statements that the amendment suggests be provided to parents. All of us who have experience of case work relating to the Child Support Agency understand perfectly well that one of the biggest bugbears and causes of contention between two parents is often an irreconcilable dispute about the figures on what has been paid in, what has been paid out and what is owing. It drives a wedge between parents; it is the biggest cause of aggravation, and leads to bad temper, anger, confusion and a great deal of very bad faith on both sides. At a stroke, if it could be magicked&#151;although I am not suggesting for a moment that it is as easy as that&#151;if there was some definitive accepted statement of the real situation, on an accurate, real-time ongoing basis, that would deal with a lot of the confusion and anger that arises in these circumstances and avoid a lot of disputes. The quintessentially simple idea is that once a quarter, both parents would get a statement through the letterbox, as I do from the Bank of Scotland, saying how much I owe. Then they would be capable of accepting the information in front of them and make their dispositions accordingly. If we could get into that situation, the resolution of these disputes would be easier.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000066"></a>The Minister was trying to help us last week by explaining that the new computer release, PR1, will sort some of the glitches in the current system and give enhanced facility and specification. One thing that I would like to know is whether PR1, if or when it is introduced in the course of the financial year, will provide that functionality and, if it can, how quickly it would be possible&#151;if the Government decided to move in that direction&#151;to produce that level of service. In particular, when the new statutory scheme starts in 2010, I would be very disappointed if we could not get, if not this precise proposal, something  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC505"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC505</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>like it that serves the same purpose. If there were to be a regular flow of statements setting out the current position for both sets of parents, it would be strongly my advice that the user groups dealing with these groups of parents should be embraced in setting up the information and setting it out in a user-friendly way so that the best value could be obtained from any such initiative. So it is an important suggestion. It would help if it could be done; if it cannot be done, I should like to know why. If a technicality is getting in the way, I should like to know if there are other ways around it.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000067"></a>Amendment No. 81 and Amendments Nos. 83 and 201 proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, move into the territory of information being made available to the parent with care. Again, some of the same preliminary arguments obtain. Resentment and bitterness results when uncertainty about financial circumstances is evident. It can also prevent unnecessary appeals. From my experience of dealing with casework, the odds are stacked against the parent with care in trying to work out whether she has a case for variation or appeal. It is a high test to get a variation and an even higher one to get an appeal, but only then does she get access as of right to the level and quality of financial information that would enable her&#151;and it is invariably a her&#151;to decide whether she has a case or not. It is very cumbersome, stressful and expensive set of circumstances to contemplate.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000068"></a>At the moment, to put it crudely, the system seems simply to accept what the non-resident parent says. It is almost taken at face value. Experience since 1993 is that that is not a safe position to be in. Perhaps the casework that reaches those who are trying to help people consists of the aberrant cases, which involve the small percentage of people who are trying to swing the lead. But it seems wrong that the dice are loaded so self-evidently against the parent with care. That is the experience that has built up since the old and new schemes of the CSA were put into place. This legislation gives us a chance to try to redress that balance&#151;and if we do not take it, that would be a great shame. The amendments deal with some of those important issues.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000069"></a>Amendment No. 77 specifically asks for a duty to be put on the commission to ask for that information. At the moment, the requirements are so soft that unless the NRP&#151;usually the absent father&#151;refuses, delays or deliberately and fraudulently makes a statement, nothing much more is done about it. The request to furnish information is made so that the Secretary of State can make his assessment of potential liability. It certainly is true that the NRP commits an offence if he makes a false declaration or fails to provide it; but he has got to be asked. In Amendment No. 77, I am saying that we should always ask all of them, ab initio, right at the start, so that if the answer comes back wrong, deliberately or otherwise, the situation can be dealt with at that time.

If we are interested in trying to generate the best outcomes for children, simply adding another step that asks every NRP to supply basic details of all his income sources gives you a very much stronger position to start from.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000070"></a>Looking at the figures for the year to March 2007, I notice 481 prosecutions for failing or misrepresenting circumstances. That is a tiny proportion of people who are doing this. Okay, prosecutions are hard to get, and the agency has been in a bunker trying to get through the legacy issues, but that is not adequate. The Bill gives us a chance to address it, and I will be very disappointed if we cannot get some improvement on the current situation.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000071"></a>Two amendments that are slightly off beam of the others are Amendments Nos. 202 and 206. Amendment No. 202 looks at risk assessment being required by the Office of Government Commerce or whoever&#151;I am indifferent as to who does it, but the OGC is probably best qualified to do it&#151;to make sure that there is rigorous, adequate protection and thought given to data sharing. We have noticed laptops going astray and CDs being committed to the post and lost. We need to lock this down in policy at a very early stage. I do not even know how long records are kept for or what the policy is for access to records, but in terms of loss of data, error, system failure and transmission of case data around the system, we need to have rigorous protection in hand. If I can get an assurance about that I will be happier. Amendment No. 206 is an invitation to make clear the fact that the courts with jurisdiction and hearing cases in these matters are not going to be stymied by people saying that they cannot have data either from HMRC or elsewhere. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000074"></a>The commission&#146;s primary concerns of supporting maintenance arrangements and ensuring that parents comply with their obligations should be its priority. We had long discussions on Clauses 1 and 2 on Tuesday last week. We do not want to risk overburdening the commission with too many obligations that might distract from those priorities, as laudable&#151;I say that with due deference to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood&#151;as these obligations might be. Of course, dissemination of this sort of information might prove useful at some stage. I wonder whether the Minister feels that one of the

If he feels that, it seems to me perfectly obvious that we need to do something or we need to amend the Bill in some way to try to solve that problem.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000075"></a>On my Amendment No. 83, I sought advice on the drafting from Resolution&#151;the Solicitors Family Law Association. This amendment considers the issue of disclosure of information to the parent with care. As the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said, under the current provisions and under the proposed system the parent with care is powerless to advise the committee whether she believes the maintenance calculation has been carried out correctly because she simply does not know. That is due to the fact that only very limited income detail is provided to the parent  with care&#151;the information used in the assessment process.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000076"></a>First, I would like to consider the issues that lie behind the need for this amendment. It goes almost without saying that child maintenance is paid to the parent with care to support the child. The detailed information used in the process, in particular the income of the non-resident parent, is not provided to the parent with care, so that person has to rely on the commission to obtain all necessary information from all relevant sources. When the calculation has been carried out, the parent with care is deprived of the opportunity to check that the information given is correct or complete and, therefore, cannot evaluate whether the commission has made an appropriate decision by reference to the information provided.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000077"></a>I anticipate the Minister telling me that the information of the parent with care on the financial circumstances of her former partner&#151;or his former partner&#151;is likely to be out of date after a period. Yes, I am sure it is, but none the less, here I am interested in the original calculation and the very recently separated parent with care will have a very good idea of the financial circumstances in the case of her former partner.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000078"></a>It is my opinion that the provision of information to the parent with care would assist in the purpose of bringing about effective maintenance arrangements for children. The current and proposed systems provide an opportunity for the non-resident parent to seek to misrepresent their circumstances to reduce maintenance liabilities. Obvious examples include where the non-resident parent has failed to disclose the true extent of income or of any second income that he may receive. Later we shall discuss what income means, but for the moment I shall leave it there. No safeguards are provided to the parent with care as that person is completely excluded from the information-gathering exercise. Detailed information is, however, provided to the parent with care if an appeal is lodged, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, says, which means that the parent with care has no alternative but to lodge such an application if the level of the maintenance calculation is in their mind in question. That unnecessarily increases the workload of the appeal tribunal. I would like the  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC508"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister to give me an explanation why such detail can be provided at the appeal stage, but not at the time of the initial calculation. It seems more than illogical to me.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000079"></a>As an analogy to the child support system, in the court process where financial matters fall to be considered, there has to be full and frank disclosure between the parties supported by documentary evidence. That continues to apply if, for example, the parties have to return to court years later for spousal maintenance to be reconsidered. The spouse seeking financial support from the ex-partner is entitled to be provided with full financial information about that person's income. Child maintenance is a similar form of financial support and I query why spousal maintenance should be treated any differently from child maintenance.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000080"></a>My Amendment No. 201 follows up the amendment that I have just discussed at, I am afraid, some length, in a bid to end any secrecy or misinformation surrounding child maintenance negotiations. Does the Minister not agree that it seems unjust that civil servants working within the commission are allowed access to information that a parent with care chasing maintenance for the benefit of their child or children is not?</p>

<p><a name="08020561000081"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08020561000462"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am grateful for these amendments being tabled because they give us an opportunity to talk about information-sharing arrangements between the commission and its clients. This group variously makes provisions to require the commission to gather and share the financial details of parents prior to and after the determination of an application to the commission, to safeguard the information held by the commission, and for the commission to produce details of payments. I agree with noble Lords that ensuring that information held by the commission is secure must be important and should be a key feature of the future scheme, and that in all cases appropriate information should be made available to parents. I expect the commission to treat these issues as a serious priority.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000082"></a>Amendment No. 76 would compel the commission to provide parents with a statement of maintenance payments at three-monthly intervals following the determination of an application. That would include details of the maintenance liability, payments made and any arrears that had accrued during the period. The proposed new clause would require the commission to provide detailed information at prescribed intervals. That would place a burden on the new organisation before it had started, by effectively obliging the commission to set up a costly administrative process.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked whether the provision of routine statements would be provided for within the functionality of the current system. The functionality to produce quarterly statements is not included in PR1, although the agency is currently designing the requirement for enhanced client statements, which is planned to be included in a release later this year. We should also recognise that, for the longer term, the commission may want to explore other ways of providing parents with  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC509"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information about maintenance payments. One such option would be to provide parents with access to information via the internet, for example, just as you can sometimes get via your bank. I agree that that is too prescriptive for the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, but it is best practice to develop these arrangements so that information can be properly communicated to parents with care and non-resident parents.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000084"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08020561000463"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The Minister talks about parents. Does he mean both parents?</p>

<p><a name="08020561000085"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08020561000464"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> If statements are being produced, I see no reason why they should not encompass the obligations of the non-resident parent as well as the parent with care. There is obviously a particular issue for the parent with care, because that parent is the one receiving the cash. It is very important that they can keep up-to-date with the sums due to them under the calculations and the extent to which those sums have been received. That is probably rightly the primary, but not the exclusive, focus.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000086"></a>Amendment No. 77 would appear to require the commission to gather the financial details of non-resident parents prior to the determination of an application for maintenance. Those who fail to provide such details would be subject to criminal sanctions. I remind the Committee&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, acknowledged this&#151;that it is already a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of up to &#163;1,000, for a non-resident parent not to provide information required to make a maintenance assessment, and that will continue to be the case.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000087"></a>However, we already know that a system based on financial information provided by non-resident parents leads to substantial delays in the assessment process, and may be subject to numerous changes at the request of either parent. That is why we propose to base the assessment on historical income data provided by HMRC and not on information provided by the non-resident parent. This amendment would call that process into question. Further, this amendment would result in a significant duplication of effort, since in many cases the commission would be investigating income information that had already been looked at and provided by HMRC. No purpose would be served by repeating those investigations or requiring non-resident parents to provide the same information twice.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000088"></a>Over the past few months as the policy on information and support has been developed, one issue that has most exercised me is what income should be taken into account and how that can best be accessed. We know from experience that what has created problems in the past is the desire to have fully complete information about the expenses and income of both parents and to have to rely on a variety of sources for that information to be compiled. That was what caused the CSA, in significant measure, to fail. We must avoid that: I cannot stress that too strongly to the Committee. It is a matter that I have thought long and hard about over recent months. There is  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC510"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>something worrying about not being able to gather together all the information for an assessment to which noble Lords have referred. If that happens, we know that assessments will not be made on a timely basis and, in a large number of cases, we will not get more cash flowing to more children.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000089"></a>Amendment No. 81 would require the commission to gather information about both parents and share that information with both parties. I understand how that could be seen as beneficial to parents in understanding each other&#146;s financial circumstances, but gathering such additional information would be unnecessary to the function of the commission. I am sure that the Committee will remember the difficulties that we faced, and continue to face, in administering the first child support system. That system requires the agency to gather the financial details of both parents, and takes into account the full financial circumstances of both parents including housing costs, unearned income and loans. Further, this amendment would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the Data Protection Act 1998, as it would mean disclosing the financial circumstances of the non-resident parent to the parent with care, even in circumstances where that information is not relevant to the maintenance calculation in the current or future schemes. Under current arrangements, the parent with care can request a copy of all information relevant to their case from the Child Support Agency, and that arrangement will continue under the new commission.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000090"></a>The information that would routinely be provided and available to the parent with care would be the income of the non-resident parent on which the maintenance calculation is based. Factors affecting the maintenance liability could be any variation, the existence of a relevant other child or any personal information held regarding the parent with care themselves, but that does not necessarily amount to the full flow of information that might arise under these amendments.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000091"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that in circumstances where the relationship had just broken down, the parent with care would be likely to know quite a lot about the financial circumstances of the non-resident parent. However, that would depend on the relationship that has broken down. Clearly, if there has been a marriage or a long-standing relationship, that is more likely to be true. However, it would not be true in many of the cases with which we are dealing: the relationship might have been quite casual and brief.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000092"></a>Amendments Nos. 83 and 201 are very similar in effect so I will address them together. They would give the commission the power to share any information regarding the non-resident parent in relation to functions of child support with the parent or person with care. If we were to implement the changes suggested, we would give the commission the power to disclose such information as the address and telephone number of the non-resident parent, or the names and other personal details of other children of the non-resident parent, to the parent with care. Such inappropriate use of information held by the

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000093"></a>In practice, there are very few instances when the commission would need to provide personal and financial information relating to the non-resident parent to the parent with care in order to exercise its functions, and currently the parent with care automatically receives all details that we believe are necessary.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000094"></a>These arrangements will continue under the commission. We are sure that this provides sufficient access to information for the parent with care, while protecting the privacy of the non-resident parent.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000095"></a>Amendment No. 202 concerns the security of information and would require the information held by the commission to be subject to a risk assessment. Protecting personal information is a top priority for every government department and will be expected to be a priority for the commission also. The department is currently reviewing its IT and data-sharing arrangements to ensure that the processing and sharing of information is carried out fairly, lawfully and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000096"></a>The department plans to ensure that the commission follows through any recommendations from the review and will, if necessary, ensure this by using its powers to issue guidance and direction to the commission. Therefore, I do not believe that it is necessary for the Office of Government Commerce to perform a risk assessment on the data as held by the commission.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000097"></a>Amendment No. 206, the final amendment from this group, would give the courts access to much of the information held by the commission. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 to the Bill puts into place powers for the commission to transfer information between agents acting on behalf of the commission. It also enables the commission&#146;s agents to give information acquired while acting on behalf of the commission back to the commission. Further, the agency is currently able, and the commission will be able in the future, to disclose information to the courts and tribunals where such disclosure is made for the purposes of any proceedings relating to the Child Support Act 1991 or where a court has exercised any power to make, vary or revive a maintenance order or maintenance agreement. This enables the agency and the commission to disclose information when applying for or defending an action which has been brought in respect of a particular issue on a case. We believe that it would be inappropriate for the commission to disclose information to the courts in matters beyond its primary concerns, which could include property disputes, custody hearings, or criminal trials. I hope that with those assurances and arguments, I have convinced the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>

I wanted to make it clear that no one is expecting the commission routinely to disclose revenue information regarding NRPs to the parent with care in every case. I will study carefully what the Minister said, but I think that he is founding far too much on the ability of HMRC to be able to identify anything other than a single income stream, whether earned or otherwise. If that is the basis of everything that flows&#151;I understand the need to get it done quickly and to get the assessment made and in place&#151;there is a real risk that the parent with care, who is invariably the mother, will be left short-changed. We will come on to that later.</p>

We will come on to discuss the broader issues around investment income, but certainly the starting point is that that information will not be used in the calculation of maintenance. It is not routinely included in the current system, but we will come on to that later.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000101"></a>We want to be clear that we believe that the information flow from HMRC will deliver what we need to make the assessment, given the constraints of that assessment process.</p>

There is a real risk that she will be short-changed.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000103"></a>I have picked up on something else, but I do not want to stray into the next debate. Using data protection too early in all this worries me because the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 has some right and proper protections for people&#146;s records. Section 18 states that data can be provided where it is in the public interest to disclose under Section 20 of that Act. I hope that we are not going to start hiding behind confidentiality to deny parents with care the ability to make proper judgment about whether they have title to mount a variation.</p>

I was told this morning&#151;I think that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, received the same message&#151;that bone fide pressure groups and specialist organisations such as Barnardo&#146;s, the Child Poverty Action Group, Citizens Advice, National Children&#146;s Bureau, the National Council for One Parent Families, Gingerbread and Resolution are all deeply interested in this group of amendments.

<p><a name="08020561000111"></a>Before I say anything else about the merits of the amendment, I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity for an update as to when and exactly how Sections 6 and 46 may be abolished. I know that the intention is that it will be by the end of 2008, but that is now looming. If we are to have a staged abolition of Section 6&#151;and I am not sure about that&#151;it is important to notify at least those organisations I have mentioned. They deal, importantly, with clients, trying to advise them and help them through the process of change. If Section 6 is rolled out just for new benefit applicants, what will happen to existing benefit claimants who want to opt out? That may still be being worked on, but we must be careful about how we do it. If it is done the wrong way, and if those clients say that they no longer want child support via the CSA, they could face a reduced benefit direction. I am sure that the Minister is alive to that, but it is the kind of pit that we could easily fall into if we do not plan this properly.</p>

However, if anything can be said about the transition towards the end of 2008 to move out of Sections 6 and 46, it would be of assistance to the Committee&#146;s proceedings today.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000113"></a>Amendment No. 78 makes the abolition of Section 6 conditional on the introduction of a full maintenance disregard for income support or jobseeker&#146;s allowance means-tested. Obviously, it is a probing amendment. Parliament did rather well in getting the maintenance disregards that it did. The announcements that came in the Pre-Budget Statement were very welcome. I think that 41,000 on benefit under the old scheme will receive the &#163;10 disregard from the end of 2008. It has been increased to &#163;20 thereafter, and &#163;40 from 2010-11 will make a difference. It will drill into some of the more intractable parts of the campaign to eradicate child poverty. There are estimates in the Henshaw report of how many children that could take out of poverty.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000114"></a>The case for a full maintenance disregard gets stronger as we go on. We had some important debates earlier in the Committee&#146;s proceedings about how important child poverty is to the public debate, going forward to 2010 and the Government&#146;s eventual  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC514"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>abolition target of 2020. Here we have the prospect of a real, tangible, early way of maximising the number of children lifted out of poverty through the child maintenance system that is costed and targeted. Henshaw&#146;s modelling suggested 80,000 or 90,000 children; that is 30,000 or 40,000 on top of the 50,000 in the pre-Budget announcement. That prize is really worth driving for. Even if there is no other reason for adopting a full maintenance disregard, that would be sufficient in itself to make the case.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000115"></a>Briefly, I want to mention three or four other things that are pretty obvious but worth restating. It would be a significant incentive to the non-resident parent to pay child maintenance. However, there is a danger that if we get to &#163;40 in 2010-11, it could become the going rate for payment to parents with care and benefit. That, as Professor Parkinson pointed out when he was over a couple of weeks ago, could have the perverse effect of leaving wealthier non-resident parents to benefit if they are making payments to parents with care on benefit, and sticking to the &#163;40 rate when they could be paying more. An incentive effect can be realised from this policy if we seize the opportunity in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000116"></a>It is cost-effective. Some of the department&#146;s modelling suggests that an extra &#163;90 million, on top of the &#163;140 million already committed, is a significant sum of money. I am not daft; I know this. Comparing the cost per child of lifting people out of poverty against the cost per child of doing the same thing using the tax credits system, my evidence is that child maintenance could lift a child out of poverty for &#163;3,000; it would cost &#163;4,300 with the tax credit system of which the Prime Minister is so enamoured. Full disregard is a cost-effective way as against child tax credits, which seem to be the Government&#146;s favoured mechanism for making future improvements in child poverty. If the Government are thinking of doing that, this is the cost-effective way of getting the same end result.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000117"></a>Administrative savings are not insignificant. The current notification and re-notification process within Jobcentre Plus and the Child Support Agency have obviously come across great difficulties in co-ordinating the payments and keeping them up to date as parents with care fall out of work, into benefit and back again. I cannot quantify that, but I know that there will be serious and significant administrative savings in a number of different respects, costs which Jobcentre Plus and the Child Support Agency are stuck with under the current system, complicated as it is.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000118"></a>It is not right to use as a defence against a full maintenance disregard that it is a potential work disincentive. A learned article by Professor Alan Marsh, only a quarter of which I understand, may have been put in the Minister&#146;s red box. If it has not, I hope that it will be this weekend; it does not make for happy reading, I can tell you. It is a learned piece of work that certainly persuaded me, as a layman, that work incentives remain strong even when maintenance is fully disregarded. That cannot be fully ignored. That is especially true in looking at the new requirements for parents with care with children aged 7 and over, where they will be expected to look for work as a condition of receiving benefit come 2010.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000119"></a>There is a whole host of good reasons for making this case. I would not be surprised if the department was quietly making it to the Treasury itself. This would be a big hit, a real gain, and would launch this new commission with a flourish. It would give everyone a whole lot more enthusiasm in getting it to win over public hearts and minds, and would make a real difference. The Government need every lever available to them to realise the target of halving child poverty by 2010. I do not think that there is any realistic chance of that. I do not believe they can abolish child poverty by 2020, unless they use levers like full maintenance disregards. The case is very compelling. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000120"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08020561000471"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The amendments in this group, so ably moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, again suggest some caution in regard to the abolition of Sections 6 and 46 of the Child Support Act 1991. They make that requirement to co-operate stated in the 1991 Act conditional on the introduction of a full maintenance disregard for child maintenance payments with income support and jobseeker&#146;s allowance. If I had any in this room, my noble friends would be rather surprised that I added my name to these amendments, because they are not yet my party&#146;s policy. I put my name to them to point out an anomaly, as I see it and to which I have referred in earlier debates, in the benefits system.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000121"></a>Child maintenance payments are wholly disregarded for tax credit purposes. These amendments would allow the same complete disregard for poorer parents with care; that is, those on the benefits I have just stated. Does the Minister have any idea how much this would cost? The proposed maximum disregard of &#163;20 from 2008, rising to &#163;40 in 2010, would make it unlikely, where the parent with care is on benefit, that the non-resident parent would choose to pay any more than this amount even if he could afford it. Here, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. Private maintenance arrangements would not result in any more than the disregard. There will therefore inevitably be wide money differences between the statutory and the non-statutory schemes. I recognise that a full maintenance disregard would provide the largest incentive to parents with care to seek maintenance and non-resident parents to pay what they can afford, and would increase the numbers of children taken out of poverty. That is, if it is affordable, and it may or may not be a big &#147;if&#148;. I shall await the Minister&#146;s answer on that with eagerness.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000122"></a>I would also think that the Government would find these amendments appealing, given that the application of this disregard would mean significant administrative benefits to CMEC and to Jobcentre Plus. I support the thrust to get a debate going on this, although I did not support the detail.</p>

As Members of the Committee will be aware, our aim is to encourage parents to make their own  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC516"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>arrangements for maintenance while maintaining a statutory maintenance service for those who cannot or do not wish to. This is why we propose to repeal Sections 6 and 46. This removal of compulsion is the first step in moving to the new system of child maintenance.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000124"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked me specifically about timing on the removal of this. These are working assumptions, which I referred to in a previous debate. They are not locked in precisely. It may depend in part on how quickly we make progress on this Bill and get Royal Assent. The noble Lord can assist us in that. The proposal is that in July 2008 the reduced benefit directions will be removed for everyone and the Section 6 compulsion will be removed for the flow of people onto the maintenance arrangements. For the reason I outlined earlier, there is no point in forcing people who do not want to be in the system to be in it and, as soon as they are in it, giving them the choice of staying in it or not. In a sense, it will be a two-stage process, with October being the date when we currently hope that the Section 6 compulsion will be removed across the piece. At that point, the higher disregards, the &#163;20 disregard, and the current scheme cases extended to voluntary scheme cases will be introduced, and in 2010 there will be the higher disregard of &#163;40.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000125"></a>We will continue to encourage parents to arrange child maintenance alongside the repeal of Sections 6 and 46. The commission will provide an information and support service supporting parents, particularly those on low incomes, enabling them to make maintenance arrangements which suit them best. I stress that when the removal of Section 6 happens it will be vital that the information and support service is up and running in a robust fashion. In the child maintenance White Paper, we made the commitment that from 2010-11 parents with care on benefit would be able to keep significantly more of the maintenance paid before their benefit is affected.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000126"></a>The announcement made in the 2007 Pre-Budget Report exceeded that commitment; the disregard will be increased to &#163;20 a week by the end of 2008 and extended to parents on the pre-2003 child maintenance scheme who are currently not eligible for it. There will also be a full disregard in housing benefit and council tax benefit from this point. We will then double the disregard to &#163;40 a week from April 2010. This marks a clear contrast with arrangements prior to 2003, where each &#163;1 of maintenance paid reduced benefit entitlement by the same amount. The changes will benefit some 350,000 children and will lift around 50,000 children out of poverty.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000127"></a>We want to start encouraging parents to make maintenance arrangements as soon as possible, so we should not make the timing conditional on increasing the benefit disregard, whether to &#163;20, &#163;40 or to a full disregard. It is important that we do not put that stricture in place, and I do not think that was the intention of the noble Lord. There is enough in the new system from the outset&#151;the extended and increased disregard and the new information and

We will be building on that by doubling the disregard in 2010.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000128"></a>A number of points were raised about cost. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked what it would cost. There was an old figure of &#163;230 million, but that has subsequently been adjusted and updated to &#163;180 million. That is a tentative figure, but it gives the scale of the possible cost involved. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, said that it is important to use all the levers that we can in tackling child poverty. That is right, and a lot of levers are being used, particularly with the focus on work, getting lone parents into work and supporting them in that, and the use of the tax credits system. Child maintenance has an important role to play, and the disregards that we are proposing to enter into the system will make a significant contribution. We should not hold up the introduction of these important changes until a full disregard may be available.</p>

That is the crux of the matter.</p>

It is a much higher ceiling than we have at the moment with the &#163;10 disregard, so it is a substantial move. There is some risk that that will be seen as a target figure in some cases, but not necessarily in all cases.</p>

At the moment, without that &#163;40 limit, the arrangements are overwhelmingly below &#163;40. Seventy-five per cent of the case load has a maintenance liability of less than &#163;20.</p>

It is true that the cost came down: it was over &#163;200 million and fell to &#163;180 million. I am not sure whether that is gross or net. It is important to know what the best modelling advice is because the figure for the totality of the cost and the savings is much more sellable to the Treasury than we would imagine. I would like to ensure that we can get the best handle on what figure is at stake, and that would be in the department&#146;s interest as well. It is undoubtedly a big sum, but there would be a lot of benefit if it could be found.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000140"></a>The noble Lord said: The three amendments in this group tabled by my noble friend and me try to tackle the thorny issue of shared care and attempt to take a realistic view of it. Amendment No. 82 calls for a review of the shared care rules within 12 months of the Act coming into force. Amendment No. 89 is more of a probing amendment than many amendments and is about the process of the shared care decisions. Amendment No. 90 is effectively an attempt to define realistic shared care.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000141"></a>I know that there is a great danger that when a Minister sees a call for a review his eyes start to glaze over, but the aim of Amendment No. 82 is to try to value the shared care; that is, the support of the parent who does not have day-to-day care. What is that parent&#146;s role and what should be given to encourage him or her to take a greater role in support? The unfortunate background to this is that people may use shared care simply as a way of making fewer payments; it is, generally speaking, fathers saying that because he takes the child for x amount of time, x number of days or x number of afternoons there should be a reduction. This is not a call for that. It is a call for a review about what should be required to encourage and support people in the sharing process. We have heard so many arguments stating that two parents are better than one. If those parents decide that they cannot or will not live together in the same household unit, having the two parents making input separately is surely better than having only one doing so. All the arguments in another part of the department about respite care surely reinforce that. There needs to be a real review about government intervention&#151;for instance, providing support to enable the person who is not the main carer to have interaction.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000142"></a>Amendment No. 89 again is a probing amendment to seek clarification and answers to some unanswered questions. Will the interim shared-care provision apply to all parents who approach CMEC or just those who

For instance, will there be any grounds for an appeal where the non-resident parent does not have the children overnight during the six-month period and, therefore, the parent with care will lose out on some much-needed financial support for the children? How do those things work? That is what we are trying to get at.</p>
<h5><a name="08020561000434"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000143"></a>Amendment No. 90 probably is the most substantial amendment. The amendment would allow for a deduction in child maintenance and liability in respect of shared care only if the child in question stays overnight with a non-resident parent for at least three nights a week on average or at least 156 days in a 12-month period. Effectively, in a seven-day week, three nights a week probably is about as close as you can get for shared care. It is half the time and is a long-term commitment. How can we bring that in? When you take on the fact that this is split as close to down the middle as you can get in a seven-day week, what is the situation? Can we have more clarification? If a person takes on that degree of the upbringing of the child, there might be some concern about whether they are also providing things like half the clothing and school-runs, et cetera. There might need to be a declaration that a person is doing half the care or something very close to it. Should that be taken into account? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000144"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08020561000479"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Addington, for moving this amendment and for the manner in which he did it. This group variously makes provisions to increase the threshold at which shared care is taken into account in the maintenance calculation; removes the new rules proposed by the Government to aid in the administration of shared care; and requires the Secretary of State to publish a report, within 12 months of this Bill coming into force, reviewing the current shared-care rules.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000145"></a>I am aware of the noble Lord&#146;s concerns regarding the shared-care rules as they operate under the current schemes, and on the issue of the new shared-care provisions that this Bill will allow for. Therefore, I welcome this opportunity for debate, and recognise that the shared-care regime as it stands does not perfectly satisfy either parents with care or non-resident parents. However, I believe that the rules strike a reasonable balance between parents.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000146"></a>Amendment No. 82 requires the Secretary of State to publish a report reviewing shared-care rules with a view to their abolition. Shared care is an issue with no unanimous view about the right way forward. The consultation on the child maintenance White Paper revealed little common ground among stakeholders as to what the rules should be. As such, existing rules will be carried forward largely unchanged, and there are no plans to depart from the basic rule that any reduction should be based on the number of nights a non-resident parent has their child with them.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000147"></a>Obviously, as we have developed these and previous child maintenance proposals, we have fundamentally looked to uncouple issues of contact between parents and their children, recognising all the  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC520"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>research and important information on engagement of non-resident parents with their children, as well as engagement with parents with care, with issues of child maintenance, notwithstanding the need to recognise that costs are involved if non-resident parents look after their children from time to time on one basis or another. We try to de-link those two issues of contact and maintenance.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000148"></a>The rules that determine which parent should pay in a case of shared care are currently in regulations and will continue to be in the future scheme. If we decide to make any changes to the rules on shared care at the same time as we are introducing the first regulations for the new calculation rules, they will be made through the affirmative resolution procedure and therefore undergo scrutiny by Parliament. Such a report as suggested would therefore seem unnecessary. So there will be an opportunity to debate them.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000149"></a>We have introduced a number of minor changes to the shared-care regime to help parents reach an ongoing agreement, which Amendment No. 89 seeks to remove&#151;I understand that it is a probing amendment. These changes allow regulations to be made which would allow the commission to proceed with a maintenance calculation for a certain period on the basis of an assumption about the level of shared care if parents have not yet agreed what the level should be.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000150"></a>In a range of discussions we had with stakeholders, it was represented to us that one problem in getting maintenance arrangements under way quickly was arguments about shared care. We looked administratively to see how we could cut through that problem. The proposal is that for the first six months of the case an interim decision will be made to give the parents the chance to reach a decision in their own time. At the end of the six-month period, if agreement has been reached, then that can be used as the basis for the adjustment of the maintenance calculation. If no agreement has been reached by that stage, then the reality of the existing shared-care arrangement can be used to determine the effect on liability. The aim is to help a pattern of shared care to be established that will provide a more accurate basis for the maintenance calculation. Removing those powers, as suggested by the amendment, would result in that not being possible.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000153"></a>Amendment No. 90 would mean that a reduction in maintenance liabilities for shared care would not occur unless care was shared for at least 150 nights per year. The noble Lord may wish to distinguish equal care from shared care. There are arguments about whether any maintenance should be paid in equal-care arrangements. That is not where the Government are on that; we are currently planning to carry forward the current arrangements. We are committed to recognising ongoing shared-care arrangements where they exist

If these amendments were accepted, the commission would be unable to recognise the vast majority of shared-care arrangements.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000154"></a>Where shared care does occur, in most cases it is for fewer than two nights a week. Only about 2 per cent of the agency&#146;s caseload has overnight care of children for 156 nights or more per year. The reduction in maintenance recognises that shared care invariably involves non-resident parents in extra expense and that that can be substantial. The rules offer a simple and transparent incentive for non-resident parents to share care, both financially and in terms of legal recognition of the ongoing relationship. If the threshold for shared care to be taken into account is increased to 156 nights per year, more non-resident parents would be unable to meet the costs of their children staying overnight and shared-care arrangements would suffer as a result. I hope that on the basis of that explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment. If he feels I have not covered all the points he raised, and if he lets me know, I shall try again.</p>

On Amendment No. 82, his answer was, &#147;Don&#146;t worry. We&#146;ll get back to it, probably in this Room, going through regulations at considerable length&#148;. On reflection, I think that Amendment No. 90 might be too high a threshold. One of the reasons why it was designed as it is was to show that there should be an expectation that some contact&#151;the odd overnight stay&#151;should be regarded as perfectly normal. Is it part of the Government&#146;s thinking that it should be quite normal to have some contact&#151;for instance, the odd stay-over? Would that be regarded as normal, as nothing exceptional?</p>

<p><a name="08020561000156"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="08020561000483"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Of course, we would encourage that sort of contact when it was appropriate&#151;and there may be cases when it is not. At the moment the threshold at which adjustment to maintenance obligations kicks in with shared care is when it reaches 52 nights a year. Below that, if there are overnight stays, there would be no adjustment. So we already have a threshold. When overnight contact is between 52 or 103 nights, or further up the scale, and when it is appropriate, the Government would want to encourage it. It is for the parents and children involved to settle these matters. We do not want to have arrangements that would discourage that.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000157"></a>The problem with this issue, and the one that we face through a number of engagements with stakeholders, is that some say there should be no adjustment for shared care, while others say that there should be far greater adjustment. That is why we felt that there was no compelling reason to move away from the current scale, other than to seek administratively to ensure that the arrangements do not get in the way of allowing assessments to be made, not only in respect of the opening period and how you can identify what the starting point should be for shared-care adjustments but also to lock the arrangements in as part of the fixed-term awards. Another bugbear of the current system is that there are endless requests for changes of

Administratively that can be very complex, so trying to get that sorted up front and to lock into fixed-term arrangements, as we seek to do on incomes as well, will certainly help to make maintenance arrangements effective and move cash more quickly for the benefit of children.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000167"></a>I shall provide a bit of background on the 12-month rule so that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet&#151;or page of legislation. The rule applies where parents have a consent order or, in Scotland, minutes of agreement, made on or after 3 March 2003, dealing with the payment of child maintenance. The rule prevents parents from applying to the CSA for a maintenance calculation for the first 12 months that the order is in place. After that period, either parent may apply to the CSA, effectively terminating the original order.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000168"></a>The Solicitors Family Law Association&#151;Resolution&#151;provided me with a real case to explain the point. Resolution was acting for the parent with care in a divorce case, attempting to negotiate a financial agreement. The division of capital was actually agreed, but they failed to reach a settlement. The case had to go to a final two-day hearing, solely because of the issue of maintenance. While the non-resident parent offered a figure for child maintenance, they wanted it to be called a &#147;school fees order&#148; to ensure that after 12 months the parent with care could not refer the matter to the CSA with a result that the payment was reduced. The non-resident parent refused on that basis.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000169"></a>I have tried to anticipate the Minister&#146;s retort. Perhaps he is about to say that if the 12-month rule was abolished, parents would be locked into agreements that were no longer working. However, that is not the case. An order for child maintenance invariably has an indexation clause providing for yearly increases. Applications back to court are therefore extremely unusual because, unless there has been a substantial change of circumstances&#151;for example, one party has had a significant windfall&#151;there is simply no need to return to court. The 12-month rule does not promote this &#147;set and forget&#148; concept, as it promotes future applications between the parties even if there has been no change.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000170"></a>The question then arises whether the 12-month rule becomes so crucial for all parents, because of the problems in the past, when parents transferred capital assets between them instead of future child maintenance. Again, that is a question that needs to be asked, as I have done, and answered&#151;which has not yet happened. Surely the issue here is whether parents should have a choice as to how they deal with their own finances if they can reach agreement. Parents understand what they require and what is best for their children, and the 12-month rule undermines their ability to reach a voluntary agreement, as no parent will reach an agreement&#151;especially when an element of capital is involved&#151;if it can simply be undermined 12 months later. On what basis can the Government interfere in what parents believe between them to be fair?</p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000171"></a>The Government have said that they will consider this matter if a case could be made that it would result in,</p>

<p><a name="08020561000369"></a>To me, such a comment only demonstrates that the refusal to abolish the 12-month rule has little to do with a concern about proper arrangements being made by parents for their children. I beg to move.</p>

As a probing amendment it is to be welcomed, because it will be interesting to see how the provisions have worked. But may I take him back a stage and explain about the 12-month rule? When we were looking at the CSA provisions for the 2000 Act, representations were made about the difficulty of having a sensible relationship between the CSA and the court system, and the degree of possible churning. Lawyers were sometimes altering the financial support between the parent with care and the children to minimise those obligations and, as the noble Lord rightly said, playing around with issues about capital and income. </p>

<a name="80205-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000173"></a>After meeting with senior judges, including someone who is now a Law Lord, it was felt that, if we could produce a formula, lawyers on both sides would come to an agreement about the appropriate level of child support within the court. The phrase that we used was &#147;in the shadow of the CSA&#148;. In other words, they would know that there was a presumption in favour of what was then, in terms of net, 15 per cent for the first child and so forth. Obviously, with consent that could be varied, and would be for issues such as school fees&#151;always one of the biggies&#151;or adjustments in the arrangements of who stayed with whom.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80205-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000174"></a>We were asked to include the 12-month ruling because it would provide steadiness. For 12 months after the court settlement, things could bed down and there would be no immediate return to the court under ever-changing arguments. After that 12 months, provided that you gave the other party two months&#146; notice, you could return to the court to vary the arrangements. The two months&#146; notice was to make sure that solicitors and lawyers on both sides could see whether they could resolve the disputed issue&#151;whether appropriate payments for school fees or whatever&#151;between themselves without formally going back to the court to ask for a new ordnance on the level of child support.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000175"></a>That scheme was carefully contrived with the support of lawyers because people pass between the benefit and the non-benefit systems. Clearly, the parent with care might want to benefit from the CSA and then may want to come off CSA and move to voluntary payments. We wanted consistency with consent for the lawyers to use. I was assured by lawyers and solicitors at the time that they thought that it was a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000176"></a>The noble Lord may have evidence which I have not so far seen in the public domain that this has produced some hard cases. In that case, it is obviously right to look at it again. However, the purpose was to try to get voluntary agreements within the framework of the CSA, with a time limit of 12 months to get some stability and two months to give notice to give those parents with care who might cycle between the voluntary and involuntary systems some degree of  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC525"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC525</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consistency. It could be argued that, if we are now going to adopt a voluntary system across the board, consistency may be less important. I would argue that it is actually more important, but that is the background.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000177"></a>I welcome this as a probing amendment, but I hope that it does not trigger a change in policy unless there is evidence for one. For every hard case we may see, the provision has allowed some stability and a structured response to the needs of children whose position would otherwise be much more precarious.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000178"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08020561000489"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Amendment No. 84 would prevent parents who have a maintenance order made by consent, or minutes of agreement registered in the Books of Council and Session or the sheriff court books, from making an application to the commission for a maintenance calculation. At present, they may apply once the order or minute has been in force for 12 months. Although the preamble to the amendment has changed a little, we understand the intent.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000179"></a>I start by thanking my noble friend Lady Hollis for reminding us in her powerful intervention about the history of this provision and why it was introduced in the first place. It is our understanding from responses to our consultation that solicitors support the use of the child maintenance formula for agreeing the level of child maintenance when that is done through the court. This negotiating &#147;in the shadow of the CSA&#148; has proved to be powerful. They said that it is a useful guide and that even without the 12-month rule they would advise their clients to agree maintenance at a similar level to the formula. In terms of removing Section 6 compulsion, we are extending choice that is available to parents.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000180"></a>The existing 12-month rule applies where parents have a maintenance order or registered minute of agreement made on or after 3 March 2003. It has two main purposes. When agreement between parents breaks down, it provides a swift and readily available route into the commission so that children are not left for considerable periods with either no maintenance or inadequate arrangements. It also encourages agreements that contain levels of child maintenance broadly consistent with the amount calculated under the statutory scheme and discourages agreements that divide up property and assets between adults and leave children without regular, ongoing payments of child maintenance.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000181"></a>We do not wish to restrict any effective and agreed maintenance arrangements, in whatever form, to 12 months, 48 months or any other period of time. In fact, the repeal of Section 6 will break the link with the benefit system so that any existing maintenance arrangements will not be overturned simply because the parent with care claims benefit. Only the action of one or both parents can do that. We want to encourage dialogue and agreement between parents which leads to effective maintenance arrangements providing ongoing support for children. As long as parents are happy that their arrangements are providing adequate maintenance for their children they can continue.</p>




<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC526"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000182"></a>Our hope is that parents will not need to turn to the commission for a calculation under the statutory scheme. The agreements will continue and benefit the children for as long as both parents want them to. However, if things do go wrong, or a parent decides that another type of arrangement would be more suitable for their children, they need a readily available route into the commission. Children must not be left for considerable periods with either no maintenance or inadequate arrangements&#151;neither should we lock parents into agreements that are no longer working.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000183"></a>Amendments Nos. 194 and 195 apply only to registered minutes of agreement. They extend the 12-month rule to 48 months and would prevent those with a registered minute of agreement made on or after 3 March 2003, which has been in place for less than 48 months, from making an application to the commission for a maintenance calculation. Registered minutes of agreement have many advantages, but if circumstances change and the original agreement needs adjustment, difficulties may arise. If parents cannot agree, there are limited circumstances in which they may apply to the court to vary the financial arrangements and, in the case of parents who were never married or in a civil partnership, the opportunity for variation is often severely restricted. We believe that a 12-month period strikes the balance between giving registered minutes of agreement a chance to bed in and work and providing a means to resolve difficulties quickly and keep payments flowing.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000184"></a>Those are all very good reasons for the 12-month rule to stay as it is and why a period of 12 months is preferable to an extended period of 48 months. The 12-month rule gives time for agreements to bed in and work but allows swift intervention by the commission to keep maintenance flowing to children. Therefore, it puts parents with court orders and registered minutes of agreement on the same footing as any other separated parents. On the basis of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will not press the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000185"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08020561000490"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am certainly not going to press the amendment, but I wonder if the Minister has considered an event which must be quite common. There are two parents with care, who, having taken their children to school, are sitting in a local cafe having a cup of coffee or tea and a bun together. One parent with care has been married and has a settlement through the courts where a capital sum has been taken into account and the maintenance on an ongoing basis is only slightly reduced from the statutory CMEC rate as a result&#151;although I understand that it could be quite a lot reduced in some circumstances.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000186"></a>The other parent with care has gone through the CMEC system and is getting &#163;x a week, which is considerably more than the weekly income of child maintenance of the first parent with care. Immediately, jealousy will raise its ugly head. As a result of that, the first parent with care will turn to CMEC. There is absolutely no doubt about that at all, even though I understand exactly what the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said about the reasons for introducing the 12-month rule.</p>

My point is that, if there is agreement between the lawyers about a capital split, that is of no interest to CMEC, is it? CMEC is interested only in weekly income&#151;I am putting it badly. It is interested only in a sum that flows regularly to the parent with care, whereas the courts look at things rather differently for very obvious reasons. I shall have to consider this very carefully and take further advice on this amendment because I am not satisfied with the Minister&#146;s answer, although it has been backed up by the undoubted experience of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000189"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08020561000493"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> In the example outlined by the noble Lord, would he accept that, inevitably, in relation to a settlement through the court, advice would have been available to the parent with care, the non-resident parent and the court and that that advice would have been given in the shadow of the statutory system and the amount of maintenance available under that system? Generally, one would expect that to be factored into the overall arrangement. It seems to me that that does not preclude capital being part of the settlement. We are talking about child maintenance and not espousal maintenance arising from a divorce or separation.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000190"></a>In a sense, I do not see the problem. If there is an awareness of the statutory system being available and an awareness of what that system would produce&#151;indeed the awareness of what the statutory system would produce should be much easier to calculate on the new basis because there will be a ready-reckoner via the information and support service&#151;the information that will be taken into account in that calculation will be clearly and swiftly obtainable, particularly if we recognise sharing information between the commission and the court. I do not see why the noble Lord has a problem with that. It may well be that parents will end up in different situations, but the key is doing that in the shadow of what the statutory system would produce, which seems to me to be the right way to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000199"></a>The noble Lord said: I am lost in admiration for how the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, can make up amendments before introducing them. That is a wonderful precedent, which I might adopt in the future. It took a lot of style, but he got away with it beautifully.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000200"></a>We now turn to the calculation of maintenance. These are probing amendments. They are all in my name and that of my noble friend. They seek to do no more than to look at questions that arise from the calculation of maintenance. I want to spend some time on Amendment No. 91, but briefly I shall refer to Amendments Nos. 86 and 87.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000201"></a>The provenance of Amendment No. 86 is the tolerance limits that are required for public prosecution and court proceedings. The chief executive of the Child Support Agency has a really difficult task if the courts ask him to be penny perfect in every assessment before he takes on a prosecution or enforcement. I am not trying to introduce any slovenly, casual attempts at getting assessments right, but getting things right to the nearest penny, and having cases sent back because they are a few pence or pounds short, one way or the other, has been an enormous cause of delay in the past and I do not think that is fair.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000202"></a>This amendment is far from competent or technically correct, but it is an attempt to say to colleagues that maybe we should take a deliberate decision to achieve the benefits of expediency and getting things done in a sensible way. Is there not a tolerance limit that we would be prepared to accept? This amendment is designed, as much as anything, to help the organisation to get things more or less right.  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC529"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC529</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I am reminded of the old highland &#147;ATHINE&#148; principle&#151;&#147;Ach to hell, it&#146;s near enough&#148;. As far as I, as a lowlander, can make out, that is the way in which much highland life is lived.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000203"></a>I am not trying to put inaccuracy into the system, but there comes a point when parents with care and non-resident parents would be prepared to accept an amount to within 1 per cent or 2 per cent, or anything up to 5 per cent. It would make sense to consider at least the potential for giving the prosecution and enforcement arm of this new organisation some wiggle room when it comes to clearing cases in magistrates&#146; courts. The sheriff in the Jedburgh sheriff court hated taking cases for local authorities and other public bodies, as I had to do from time to time. One always had a very hard time because when the sheriff had any discretion available to him, naturally enough, he would always take the side of the defender and not the pursuer, so I got the rough end a number of times. My career was short lived, but not just for that reason&#151;I was elected.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000204"></a>Perhaps some consideration should be given to leaving a little more room for manoeuvre for the enforcement mechanisms. Perhaps I can attach to Amendment No. 86 a further question, which arises from page 35 of the annual report of the CSA. The 2006-07 report talks about the standards committee&#146;s work in the previous year and about the committee being relaunched. We are still talking about the accuracy standards of assessments. The annual report says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020561000411"></a>&#147;This committee was re-launched mid-year under a new Non-Executive Chair and met twice in the latter half of the year&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020561000370"></a>It goes on to talk about acknowledging and endorsing,</p>
<ul><a name="08020561000427"></a>&#147;the new approach to accuracy checking and quality assurance, which is expected to result in measurable performance [improvement] during 2007/08&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020561000371"></a>That is very welcome. However, the reports of the old standards committee used to be put on the website and published in summary in the annual report. I have noticed that that seems to have slipped. Perhaps I could have some reassurance about that.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000205"></a>Amendment No. 87 is a probing amendment. There is an argument which says that if we are moving away from the quintessential simplicity of 10, 15 or 20 per cent in the net system that is used currently to 12, 16, 19 per cent gross and we have the change if the income is between &#163;800 and &#163;3,000 a year&#151;of course, there are reductions in the hands of non-resident parents for relevant children&#151;perhaps we cannot be as confident as the proposals in front of us that these will be equivalent amounts. It is a difficult judgment. You are trying to mirror the net system that we have now in the new system and do it accurately. That looks a little rough and ready to me. I do not know how we should do it. I make no complaint about that.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000206"></a>All that Amendment No. 87 seeks to do is to say, in case we get that wrong and in case it needs to be fixed quickly, we should look at putting the percentages into secondary and not primary legislation, so that  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC530"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC530</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they can be amended at the pleasure of both Houses of Parliament. There are other reasons as well besides just getting the equivalent net/gross figures. We could find that some of them are too high and that there were interferences with tax credit regimes and so on. There is a case for putting the basic rate percentages into secondary legislation so that they can be more flexible.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000207"></a>I need to get a series of questions clear in my head. I am not complaining about anything or advocating anything, but I am trying to ensure that I understand the future role that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will have in calculating child maintenance. They are important questions so I hope that the Committee will bear with me. It is true to say that there is much to be gained in using HMRC data in terms of spitting out the calculation and looking at ways of dealing with non-co-operation by non-resident parents. That is all understood.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000208"></a>I want to get it clear in my head that we are talking about a system in the new regime which will arrive at a total gross income. The phrase &#147;total gross income&#148; is important. If the new commission is to take the first income figure that is available and that comes through the pipeline&#151;the data gateway from HMRC&#151;and is to use it to get on quickly and do an efficient calculation, that is one thing. It is not what I understand should happen, but it may be what is in mind to happen. The first question is: to what extent are we able and willing to alter and upgrade the systems that HMRC and CMEC will have to get the information that CMEC needs to make a proper assessment of total gross income? We need to know more about the systems. We also need to know what information CMEC understands is held by HMRC and what systems it is held on. There are different sets of systems. I do not know much about HMRC, but I know that there are different work streams to deal with PAYE, self-assessment, repayment of taxes, national insurance contributions and others. There are a lot of sophisticated systems which, for HMRC&#146;s purposes, are in silos. We are asking them, in this important set of cross-examinations we will conduct on CMEC&#146;s behalf, to cost-cut bits of information that will need to be taken from each of these silos. It is important that we understand exactly what processes will be able to do that. There will inevitably be people with combinations of earnings in different silos at different times. A total picture of a non-resident parent&#146;s income from all of these sources must be extracted as a matter of routine if the new system is to work successfully.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000209"></a>Some of the basic questions revolve around the concept of a consolidated return. I understand that it is possible, on cause shown, for the HMRC to do this, but it is a special procedure which it does not do unless it is required and has a purpose. I think we are asking it to do a whole set of consolidated returns. Maybe we are not, but I would like to know whether we are or not, or are using some other techniques to drill in to the information there. We must ensure that we get it all out. For example, I am not an expert on employment-related benefits, but I know that the  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC531"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC531</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Treasury has workflows, streams and systems that collect information from employers on employment-related benefits. We must get access to that silo as well. The key question is whether CMEC staff in the new regime will be able freely to access all of that kind of data to find out whether the non-resident parent possesses any of these kinds of income. It is important that we understand that.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000210"></a>On processes and systems, what systems will we use to transfer data? The regulatory impact assessment statement with the Bill said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020561000412"></a>&#147;There would be some initial set-up costs met by the Department for Work and Pensions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020561000372"></a>There is also a commensurate, equal and opposite, reference to the Revenue&#146;s provisions, where it says that relatively minor start-up and ongoing monitoring costs for HMRC will also be put in hand. Can we find out more about the costs of the set-up? Are they minor? Are they ongoing? How much will they cost? What significant investment is being made so that the CMEC staff can have proper access via electronic gateways to all of the data held by HMRC? Could we get the latest progress on all this? We got some information from Mr Plaskitt in the Public Bill Committee, when he talked about discussions evolving and being well advanced. It looks as if everything is in hand and we are on top of it all. I would like some reassurance that that is true.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000211"></a>Finally, I shall ask a question about when a determination has been made that a non-resident parent has significantly underreported his income. During the Public Bill Committee, Mr Plaskitt gave the impression that that will be picked up in the next year&#146;s fixed-term maintenance agreement. I understand that that is the current position, but I do not think that it is right. If you tried to persuade the Inland Revenue that you would start sorting out your tax arrears next year when you do the sums again, it might tap you on the shoulder and say that the tax arrears are due and you are liable. There should be an in-year reassessment of the non-resident parent if he has been found to have significantly underreported his income. A reconciliation should be made there and then.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000212"></a>Then there is the question of arrears. Will there be such a thing as arrears when underreporting is subsequently discovered? Will it be possible to take an historic view of the years of underreporting that have just been discovered? That could amount to a big sum of money. Are we simply going to say that that will be sorted out when the reassessment comes up next year and then everything will be all right again? I do not think that the parent with care would take kindly to that treatment, if that is what is in hand.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000213"></a>I am sorry to labour the Committee on this, but it is essential that we all clearly understand the processes of exchange by the time the Bill gets Royal Assent. My experience is that HMRC and the DWP are very unhappy&#151;that is not the right word. The DWP has had a subsidiary role to the Treasury in anything that I have been involved in in the past 10 or so years in Parliament. The Treasury usually charges for access to its time-and-line system. Its position in the Whitehall hierarchy is pretty high and mighty&#151;we all know that from a political point of view&#151;but there may be  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC532"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC532</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>difficulty in the department getting access and proper positive reactions in future communications with the Treasury. If this fails, and we cannot get the income assessments that we hope we will achieve under the new system, a big part of this change in policy will be unavailable, which would be a great shame.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000214"></a>I am asking all these questions and I do not know the answers to them&#151;it is always dangerous to ask questions when you do not know the answers. They are important questions, so I hope the Minister will forgive me for asking them in such a long-winded way. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000215"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08020561000498"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, because, particularly on the last amendment, some of his questions on the underreporting of tax income had not occurred to me. I will be interested to hear how the Minister suggests the system will respond. In the past, it would have been regarded as part of the arrears to be paid, but I am unclear about what will happen now.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000216"></a>I shall make a couple of brief comments on the other two amendments. Amendment No. 86 introduces a 2 per cent tolerance. The noble Lord has a point of substance. As I recall, it was the case that to the nearest penny it might be 78 per cent accurate, which was a remarkable figure, but to the nearest pound, it is was up to 95 per cent accurate. The problem was that if you went for the nearest penny you spent so much time doing the assessment that you did not spend enough time doing the enforcement. That was the concern: not to get sloppy accounting, but to get effort put where it mattered. It may be that my noble friend will be able to tell us that by going from net to gross income on one hand, and to tax data on the other, and from viewing the preceding year&#146;s data, there will be almost no difference in staff input in assessing to the nearest penny and the nearest pound. I think that is quite possibly the case, in which case this problem should now go away. However, it has been a problem in the past and it is therefore worth exploring the issue.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000217"></a>I have some sympathy with the second amendment about putting the requirement into regulations; not for the reasons which the noble Lord adduced, that we may want to change the percentages&#151;as far as I can see the move from net to gross percentage is perfectly sane&#151;but because one is never sure whether a case will go through the courts and possibly eventually to Europe. That may involve some unspecified form of income&#151;it could be dividends or whatever&#151;that has not come into the formula and may come back. We in Parliament are required to take this into account. In practical terms only, it may be much simpler to take account of any subsequent legal judgment, which will certainly follow any new system as the less content try to challenge it, through regulations than through primary legislation. Again, however, I am sure that my noble friend can reassure us to that effect.</p>

The amendments together relate to the statutory maintenance calculation in the future scheme, and raise a number of important questions on the accuracy of information, how maintenance will be calculated and how information about income might be obtained.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000220"></a>The changes we made in 2003 to maintenance calculations are working reasonably well, and we do not intend in the Bill to make any substantial changes to the principles behind them. The changes proposed in the Bill will further simplify the calculation process, resulting in more transparent calculations which can be made more quickly. Many of the changes&#151;for example, the new basic rate percentages and the definition of weekly income to be gross rather than net&#151;are the result of our decision to make calculations by using income information provided by HMRC. I shall come on to some of the more detailed points around that in a moment.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000221"></a>Amendment No. 86 would provide in regulations a performance target for the commission in relation to the accuracy of income information used to make a statutory maintenance calculation. Such information would have to be accurate to within 2 per cent. Since the implementation of the operational improvement plan in 2006, the Child Support Agency has increasingly focused on improving accuracy. For example, in the year ending this March, the agency expects to check fully about 6,000 decisions for accuracy, a four-fold increase on last year. The agency&#146;s latest published QSS shows an accuracy rate for the year to date of 87 per cent for maintenance calculations; the figure for the whole of 2005-06, before the OIP started to have an impact, was 81 per cent. So although there is more to do, the agency is already making improvements and will continue to do so.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000222"></a>However, it is not appropriate for this kind of target to be placed in the Bill. The commission&#146;s performance targets will be agreed between the commission and the department, and will be published in the commission&#146;s business plan. The point that the noble Lord really pressed was that, unless you have an accuracy figure, as my noble friend Lady Hollis said, you can waste a lot of time trying to fine tune the calculation when, in practice, you do not need to.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000223"></a>Amendment No. 87 would provide in regulations for an alternative method for calculating the basic rate of maintenance. We want the calculations to be based on the non-resident parent&#146;s gross income, subject to certain limits: the number of qualifying children, the shared care attributed to those children and the number of relevant children in the non-resident parent&#146;s new family. While this amendment retains the same principles, it is possible that noble Lords want a pre-set amount of liability based on non-resident parents&#146; gross income but not adjusted for income above &#163;800 per week. In fact, I do not think that that was the noble Lord&#146;s point. However, just for the record, the &#163;800 broadly corresponds to the amount of weekly income at which the 40 per cent income tax rate starts to apply. There is therefore a  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC534"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>greater difference between gross and net income at these levels. The lower percentages are designed greatly to reduce the impact on liabilities of this difference. It would not be right for either parent if, in existing cases, there was to be a substantial change in liability built in to the design of the scheme on moving to the new statutory maintenance liability. We want there to be as much stability as possible at that point.</p>
<h5><a name="08020561000438"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000224"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, challenged us a bit, asking how we know that the new percentages are right. Effectively, it has been based on a process of arithmetic. Work has been done to look at what the liabilities would be under a range of incomes for someone entering the system now on a net basis and what the equivalents would be that were set out in the RIA and other documents. The idea was to try to get it as close as possible so that it was aligned as closely as possible. The noble Lord and my noble friend Lady Hollis said that we might need to adjust those, and we need them to be in regulations. It is already the case that percentages for the maintenance calculation can be adjusted by regulations, in paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act. There is the scope to do that. That is particularly important because we have also suggested that we would probably wish to review that &#163;800 limit once during each Parliament as the threshold for higher rate tax potentially changes. There is already that scope.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000225"></a>Amendment No. 91 would preclude the possibility that regulations could allow income from a past period to be considered. We want maintenance calculations to be based on the historical income data as provided by HMRC. The commission will also be assisted by having calculation rules, which means that the HMRC information can be used with minimal adjustment. In cases where the latter differs from HMRC data by 25 per cent or more, a parent will be able to ask for a calculation to be made using that current income figure. Reliance on HMRC historical gross income data at the time of assessment and annual reviews will make maintenance calculations quicker and transparent for parents.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000226"></a>The noble Lord asked what data we are talking about here. Effectively, we are talking about employment income data and self-employment data. There is already a process by which employers have to report to HMRC gross employment incomes net of occupational pension deductions. That information should be provided within a month of the end of the year.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000227"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08020561000501"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> That is very helpful and it is a first step; we are getting there. Supposing someone has two part-time jobs and the Treasury will take the bigger one in terms of the earned income flow. Are we sure that the statement that has just been made will cover both jobs if there are two PAYE streams for the non-resident parent?</p>

The noble Lord is right. To be clear, we are not talking about any aggregation of investment income or other types of income. Again, we will probably discuss that later on. We are referring to employment income and self-employment income here.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000229"></a>On accuracy, the agency introduced a new approach to accuracy checking that significantly increased the number of cases checked&#151;I think I dealt with that&#151;and it introduced new teams to support staff in dealing with issues arising from the checking regime and ensuring ongoing remedial work to improve the accuracy of assessments. The agency has recently introduced a new accuracy measure, not as a result of switching from net to gross but as part of the quality assurance framework. The agency has introduced a cash value accuracy measure, which looks at the total of incorrect calculations against the total of correct amounts. We changed the way in which we measure and report on accuracy to focus on providing feedback to managers and teams and improving future performance.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000230"></a>The noble Lord also asked where we are on the process of transferring data from HMRC. That work and those discussions are ongoing. The information that I have before me is probably not sufficiently clear to be able to give a more specific update, so rather than do it piecemeal I shall write to the noble Lord to give him the latest information that we have on that.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000231"></a>I think that has dealt with all the noble Lord&#146;s questions about income and the transfer of data. The noble Lord talked about year-end reconciliations. The principle that we are adopting here is to not routinely have a year-end reconciliation. Clearly, if there are circumstances where the non-resident parent has inaccurately reported income, which might arise if there was a variation that was being looked at, or where other assets had to be taken into account in the calculation and there was deliberate under-reporting of income, that would be adjusted, and there would be penalties exigible for deliberate under-reporting.</p>

We are talking about circumstances in which the HMRC/DWP/CMEC nexus would identify that there was something untoward with the accuracy and the level of reporting by the non-resident parent. At what stage does a parent with care get to know about that so that she can take action? So far so good; I just hope that the Minister will make me completely happy by saying that in those circumstances someone in the system would trigger an action that would try to resolve that anomaly.</p>

That would be a circumstance in which there was an inquiry by the commission to the NRP, which should prompt a response.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000234"></a>There might be other circumstances where, although we expect the HMRC returns to capture most of the data that we want&#151;for example, if someone was self-employed and had been late with a self-assessment return, that information would not necessarily be available on as timely a basis as it might be for others&#151;the commission would have the power to make inquiries of a range of people to seek to assess what income was appropriate. Those are the sort of circumstances in which requests might be made of the NRP and others and under which the NRP would be under an obligation to respond. If that response was inaccurate, deliberately or otherwise, and the commission&#146;s inquiries identified that, that would be adjusted. The basic starting point here would routinely be HMRC data.</p>

The Minister&#146;s offer of a letter about data gateways and so on would be really helpful. It gets very detailed, and you need to think about it carefully. The new assessment procedures for the standards committee will, I hope, get published. I am not a conspiracy theorist; I do not think that this is an attempt to bury any important new standard method of calculating accuracy or squirrel it away out of the public domain. I assume that it will have the same exposure to the public gaze as the previous system, and if it has been refined and improved, I am in favour of that. I hope that we can get an assurance that it will be made public.</p>

There used to be a stripped down report in the annual report about how the standards committee had done its work and what the results were, with the methodology as well as the figures. I understand the corporate figures well enough. If that could go on the website so that it is available to those who study these things, that would be welcome. Obviously we are all agreed that the generality of the new system is clear. It deals with the exceptions. With non-resident parents we have exceptional circumstances in how they are dealt with and where the onus lies in taking the remedial action that may or may not be necessary. I do not always think that the parent with care will have the information to be able to do that.</p>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020561000414"></a>&#147;(1A) Provide for a calculation of income to include any interest, dividend or other income derived from capital.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000242"></a>The noble Lord said: It has been a somewhat rare occurrence during the almost three days in Committee that the minds of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and myself have actually chimed together. However, in this group of amendments that is the case. His Amendment No. 92 is almost identical to my Amendment No. 88. We both point out that there is a problem in the proposals, as they insist that any calculation must have factored into it interest dividend or any other income derived from capital. As we all know, income is treated differently under what are known as the old scheme cases in the Child Support Act 1991 and the new scheme cases, which happened on or after 3 March 2003.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000243"></a>Under the original Act, dividend income was taken into account by means of the Child Support (Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases) Regulations, SI 1992/1815, in paragraph 13 of Schedule 1. In particular, in the part on other income, it included:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020561000415"></a>&#147;Any interest, dividend or other income derived from capital&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020561000373"></a>As such, dividend income was caught. There was a failure when the new scheme was introduced under the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 to include a wider income clause. I do not remember being involved in discussion on that Bill, but I may have been. My noble friend Lord Higgins was in charge in those days, and I may have been asleep&#151;it is always possible.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000374"></a>The scheme defines net income specifically as earnings from employment, income from self-employment tax credit and other income. Other income is simply restricted to any periodic payment of pension or other benefit under an occupational or personal pension scheme or a retirement annuity contract, and so on. But there is no reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="08020561000428"></a>&#147;interest, dividend or other income derived from capital&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020561000375"></a>as provided for in the original scheme. Thus, such income is not automatically taken into account.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000244"></a>This loophole has some unpleasant implications for child maintenance. Parents can use it to avoid paying what is due from them. Dividend income can be a considerable source of income for a self-employed, non-resident parent and it has often been used to avoid child maintenance responsibilities. To incorporate dividend income under the 2003 and proposed scheme would require an application from the parent with care for a variation based on diversion of income, under the Child Support (Variations) Regulations, SI 2001/156. As we all know, a number of technical hurdles have to be leapt, which means that an application for variation cannot by any means be guaranteed&#151;or rather, the success of the application cannot be guaranteed. Additionally, the onus to apply is on the parent with care, who may be unaware of any dividend income received by the non-resident parent. Indeed, the Minister appears adamant that the parent with care should not be so aware, from remarks that he made earlier this  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC538"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC538</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>afternoon. Furthermore, the parent with care is likely to be unaware that such income is not automatically taken into account. If that parent with care becomes aware of the position only at a later date and at that time makes an application for a variation, it is from the date of application for the variation only that such dividend income can be taken into account. I hope that I have got that right. As I understand it, the award variation cannot be backdated to before the application was sent in.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000245"></a>Variation applications are typically referred to an appeals tribunal, which takes time and resources that would be reduced if the definition of income was expanded in accordance with the original Act. Therefore, I look forward to hearing how the Minister can reasonably assure me that the exclusion of such variables can still mean that calculations for the amount of child maintenance owed is true or fair. I doubt that he will achieve that objective.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000246"></a>Having spoken for longer than I intended, especially with the presence here of the Chief Whip, I shall not comment on the Liberal Democrat amendments. They are quite capable of doing that for themselves. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000247"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08020561000509"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I hope that I can rise to that challenge. This is an important group of amendments. I agree with the noble Lord that we are at one in spirit on this.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000248"></a>The amendments in my name and that of my noble friend are all probing, but they all deal with how we calculate some of these assessments and how we deal with evasion and inaccurate assessments. Amendment No. 92 was run in the Public Bill Committee in the House of Commons. It allows the commission in the case of self-employed non-resident parents who own a limited company or a share in one or are company directors to immediately presume a basic level of income. Based on my experience in a previous incarnation of doing casework, it was almost the biggest problem facing parents with care that they were unable when the non-resident parents were self-employed to get any real appreciation of the realistic income available to non-resident parents. Therefore, the amendments try to deal with that in a more expeditious and grown-up way.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000249"></a>The old scheme certainly gave an enormous amount of wriggle-room to non-resident parents, especially if they were self-employed or had income of other sorts, such as rental income. The level of ingenuity possible to those people under the first scheme, set up and introduced in 1993, was limitless. It never ceased to amaze me, the ingenuity that could be brought to bear by self-employed people who could lose or conceal their real income and wealth and the assets available to them. They went to any number of lengths&#151;quite extraordinary lengths&#151;because of the heat generation between the two sets of parents, who were often very angry and distressed. People were just playing games with one another in a way that made it impossible for the professionals in the agency to deal with the situation rationally. In the new situation, we must look at self-employed non-resident parents in a different light altogether.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000250"></a>Amendment No. 190 proposes a general catch-all anti-evasion clause. If I had only one pick from the amendments in this group I would go for that one. In the early days, there used to be a catch-all provision to deal with evasion, which got lost in the 1995 and 2000 legislation changes. I do not care how the provision is cast; the wording may be wrong and it may be technically incompetent, but it must be possible to have such a provision. It is right that we consider some kind of residual, catch-all, back-up, anti-evasion provision that people can take advantage of where, in their heart of hearts, they believe that they are being given the run-around by a self-employed non-resident parent who has all the power and potential of concealing income in every which way.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000251"></a>In my experience, there were websites that shared information about how best to do so; it was a joke. Those members of the non-resident parent client group were not representative, but a lot of them were being driven to distraction by the way in which the system bore down on them. There was no excuse for the way in which they were behaving. Some of them were deliberately flaunting the authority of the agency and doing so on websites in a way that was not only inimical to the parent with care but to the long-term interests of the child involved.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000252"></a>Some consideration of putting something in the Bill that strengthens the new CMEC commission establishment to deal with anti-evasion in a way that is more robust is sensible. Amendment No. 93, which goes as far as deeming an income, might seem extreme, and the amendment may be technically incompetent, but that is a way that can be found to set in legislation an ability to take the initiative, get the assessment done and then face down a non-resident parent and say that if the deemed income is not right they have the ability to get it right by putting the facts of the case fully, squarely and openly in front of the commission and the parent with care.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000253"></a>Amendment No. 95 concerns avoidance, which we have dealt with. Taken together with Amendment No. 190, it creates a general power to deal with evasion. There is a well-established rule in Scots law, and there was an earlier presumption against the alienation of assets in the social security and benefit Acts that dealt in the old supplementary benefit schemes with people gratuitously alienating assets and that being taken into account, and the system having some remedy against that where it is clearly being done in bad faith to try to elide responsibilities and duties.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000254"></a>This is an important group of amendments. I concur with what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said. If this is not technically the right way of doing this, the Minister would be well advised to think carefully about whether there is some other way of achieving the ends that are set out in this group.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000255"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08020561000510"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I agree that this is a very important group of amendments. Taken together, they relate to the statutory maintenance calculation in the future scheme and they raise a number of important questions about how it will be calculated, what income will be taken into account, how information about that income might be obtained and  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC540"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what to do about more exceptional cases. The changes that we made in 2003 to maintenance calculations are working reasonably well. As I said a moment ago, we do not intend for this Bill to make any substantial changes to the principles behind those calculations. The overall liability structure, based either on the weekly income of the non-resident parent, or on their benefit, or other specific circumstances, is broadly supported. This will continue to be complemented by a variations scheme that can apply in specified exceptional circumstances. The changes proposed in the Bill are the result of identifying opportunities to further simplify the calculation process, resulting in more transparent calculations that can be made more quickly.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000256"></a>Many of the changes&#151;for example, the new basic rate percentages and the definition of weekly income to be gross rather than net&#151;are the result of our decision to make calculations by using income information provided by HMRC. It is our intention that the detailed definition of what will count as income will be given, as now, in regulations. These will be introduced for parliamentary scrutiny and debate after the Bill has been given Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000257"></a>Amendment No. 88 would require, in addition to earned income, calculations to take account of income from capital, such as dividends and interest. Amendment No. 92 would make the same requirement, with the exception that its scope is restricted to information provided by HMRC. Amendment No. 93 would give the commission the power to presume a level of income where the non-resident parent is self-employed or a company director. Amendment No. 95 would give the power to take account of income where the non-resident parent had unreasonably deprived themselves of a resource. Finally, Amendment No. 190 simply attempts to address deprivation of resources, but limits its effect to cases where the estimated difference in income is  25 per cent or more.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000258"></a>This group of amendments broadly reflects a single significant concern of noble Lords which has exercised our mind greatly in recent months: that some non-resident parents are better able to control their resources by diverting them out of earned income into a form beyond the scope of the maintenance calculation in order to reduce the amount of child maintenance they are required to pay. This is unfair, both to children and to non-resident parents who act reasonably. I agree that any attempt by non-resident parents to manipulate their personal financial circumstances for the purpose of reducing their child maintenance payments must be firmly opposed. It is important that we take all reasonable steps to discourage such actions and to ensure parents with care receive the maintenance that truly reflects the non-resident parent&#146;s financial circumstances.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000259"></a>However, the simpler approach to calculations, with its focus on income related to earnings, is the right one. It is imperative that we do not repeat past mistakes by returning to the complexity of the first child support scheme. In that scheme&#151;as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale&#151;most forms of income are taken into account, including interest and dividends payments. Finding out about these adds to delay and, in many cases, makes little or no difference to liabilities.  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC541"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC541</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We also understand that not all taxpayers with investment income are required to complete a self assessment return and, as such, HMRC data coverage of these types of investment will, generally speaking, be less comprehensive than for earnings. Indeed, I think the approach is that you would routinely file a self assessment return if you were a director or self-employed with earnings above a certain level, or with investment income above a certain level. You might be required to report to HMRC if you had investment income which should be taxed at a higher rate, but there are no universal obligations to report, partly because a lot of investment income is taxed at source. There is therefore no need, if one is only a basic-rate taxpayer, to report that. Of course, some income is not reportable at all because it is a tax privilege, such as ISA income and tax-free capital gains up to a certain level.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000260"></a>The preferred initial approach, which we intend to carry forward, is for the variations scheme to cater for cases of significant unearned income&#151;I stress the &#147;initial&#148;. That scheme will also continue to deal with cases where a non-resident parent can control the amount of income they receive from their job, or unreasonably divert income. I should say that, although our initial approach is for the focus in mainstream maintenance calculations to be on earned income, we will work with the commission to look at the feasibility of including certain types of income such as investment and shares income. We will do this when the operational realities of using HMRC data become clearer.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000261"></a>We are also retaining the power to estimate income where available information is unreliable, insufficient or atypical. We shall be working with the commission to decide how to make best use of that power. This should help to address the issue raised in Amendment No. 93, where noble Lords wish to have scope to presume income levels for non-resident parents who are directors or self-employed.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000262"></a>Our experience of the first child support scheme is that investigating cases of possible deprivation of resources is often not straightforward. The amendment tabled on this matter would require the commission to investigate every change in income which could otherwise result in a reduction in maintenance liability. That would place a significant burden on the commission and does not fit with our intention to operate a simple, effective and value-for-money scheme. It is also unlikely to be cost-effective in terms of outcomes, as only a small minority of non-resident parents seek to manipulate their income in this way.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000263"></a>The amendment would entail the commission deciding whether any observed reduction in income was intentional or reasonable. In complex cases in which this power might be necessary, it would be difficult for commission staff to make that kind of decision.</p>

The concerns raised by noble Lords will be given careful consideration when we come to draw up those regulations.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000265"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to the variations and said that there was often not a high chance of success&#151;that it was a high hurdle to overcome. That is right, which is why we are determined to try to lower the bar so that variations are generally more accessible. Obviously, the more that we can make that happen, the greater reliance we can place on that route rather than on some of the more detailed amendments suggested here. We will come to that matter shortly, but that is our clear intent.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000266"></a>It would be helpful to put these matters in context. The family resources survey in 2005-06 found that over half the single males aged between 20 and 50&#151;which we used as the best proxy for NRP, although we know it is not perfect&#151;do not have any investment income at all and most of those who do have only small amounts. Only 5 per cent have more than &#163;10 of investment income per week and only 1 per cent have more than &#163;50 a week. That is not to say that we should not seek to access that information where it applies, but it is a small percentage of the current case load and the likely case load of the commission going forward.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000267"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, spoke about problems relating to the self-employed. Again, I believe that it is right to have our starting point for the self-employed in the returns that they make to HMRC, because we and HMRC have common cause in wanting to make sure that those returns are robust in accordance with the law and are properly constructed. However, there are provisions in the Bill, and I have touched on some of them. In the event that such information is not available, other routes will be taken to assess income. Part of the issue with the self-employed is not only making the assessment, but also having effective enforcement powers. That is another route by which we can improve the situation for self-employed people. If you look at the data at the moment, compliance for the self-employed is significantly below compliance for employed people and we need to tackle that seriously.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000268"></a>I hope that that will enable the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment. The key argument that we are seeking to advance is that, if we go back to the complexity that we had and demand as an integral and automatic part of the calculation income details that we cannot readily get from HMRC&#151;that we certainly cannot get on a fair basis across all the case load&#151;and we have to resort routinely to getting that from non-resident parents and others, we will return to the problem of having real administrative difficulties, particularly with those people who are not intent on paying the child maintenance that they should. That is why we have gone down the path that we have. The key to it is to make sure that those variations are more accessible, and we will have the chance to discuss that shortly.</p>

There are perfectly understood restrictions on what needs to be reported. I am not saying that anyone is doing anything illegal, but with clever accountants, self-employed people make it their business&#151;and it would be stupid if they did not&#151;to do everything within the law to constrain their visible income for taxation purposes. Therefore, I doubt that it is sufficient to take that figure&#151;whatever it may be&#151;as an accurate reflection of something with which we can make a calculation.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000270"></a>I may be missing something, but it is all very well to say that the generality of the working age population does not have income, investment or anything else, but that 7 per cent of the case load is what nearly drove the agency into self-destruction. That may be an exaggeration, but an enormous amount of time, energy and professional time was devoted to trying to pin down what was actually going on with a small proportion of the case load involving self-employment. I counsel caution.</p>

If the self-employed person has, with the help of accountants, declared an income that HMRC has accepted and within the law has clearly abated his returnable income by depreciation for this, that and other legitimate reasons, why does the noble Lord think that CSA staff, without the facilities, resources or information that the tax inspectors have, would be able to do a better job? Given that there is not full payment of maintenance&#151;given the &#163;40 figure&#151;the loss of the additional money is not likely to be borne by the person with care, but by the taxpayer. This is a double question. First, I do not think that you could realistically get at that information. At least&#151;Glory be!&#151;with the tax system we have a better chance. Secondly, it may not matter as much as the noble Lord thinks because it may fall into the headspace between the 40 quid a week disregard in benefit cases and the amount that might have to be paid.</p>

But it is cauld kale&#151;to use an expression my Granny used to use&#151;to the parent with care who is still left festering with the notion, rightly or wrongly, that the full income is not reflected in the assessment.

<p><a name="08020561000274"></a>Curiously, in some respects, spouses or former spouses may be in a slightly better position in relation to some self-employed people to understand the arithmetic of the calculation, because often&#151;I need to be careful about straying on to the employment of spouses in this context&#151;they are possessed of an understanding that is broader than might otherwise be the case. If we move away from HMRC as a starting point, we will be in great difficulty. Somehow suggesting that our calculation is different from that which the Revenue would accept cannot be right.</p>

I still need to be reassured that the HMRC figure covers all the silos of which I spoke. I am still not sure that the figure arrived at looks at all the bits and pieces of potential sources of income. We are talking about the potential for a variation or appeal application rather than the initial assessment. Maybe I am confusing myself and the Committee and we are getting nowhere fast, but it is very important that we do not simply say that the figure for self-employed people available to the HMRC, which I believe was delivered for a different purpose, is automatically a reflection of the assessment figure to ensure that the child gets all the maintenance to which it is entitled.</p>

It would not, just as employment income would not. There are issues around lifestyle and diversion of income and we believe the variation route is the right approach to address them, but simply picking self-employment income is not of itself going to pick up those issues, just as employment income would not. We need other mechanisms to do that.</p>

We want to be assured that everything taxable reported to HMRC is used as a basis for calculation by CMEC. It is as easy as that. I think that I got the answer at some point in the Minister&#146;s initial response.</p>

I referred to investment income. That is one case in which you could not just go to HMRC to have that broader calculation; in some cases it would have details of investment income and in others it would not. To base a system of child maintenance on whether that information was returnable to HMRC would not be right. We are saying that for employment and self-employment income&#151;broadly, earned income under old-style terminology&#151;yes, it would be possible to do that. But to take account of other income or lifestyle using the variations route, we would start with the current arrangements and look at capital of &#163;65,000 and impute an income to that&#151;which is what happens under the current scheme&#151;rather than access individual details of individual investment income, capital gains or rental income. In due course it may be possible to take account routinely and automatically of these broader issues, but that is not where we are starting. In that regard, that mirrors the current system. We are not saying on day one that the treatment of investment income is going to be any different from that which applies currently, with the exception that the route into possibly taking account of that through variations might be more accessible.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord and the Minister on the subject of intentionally devaluing your income. Over Christmas, there was a case in the magistrates&#146; court in Taunton where a young man who was a non-resident parent intentionally made himself unemployed in order to avoid his responsibilities. His defence was that he had sought to become self-employed, but in the mean time, there would have been no money flowing through the system. I do not know the result, but I am sure that the Minister or I can check. It does not particularly matter; the point is that I regard that as a despicable thing to do. I think the Minister does too; we probably all do.</p>

The timeframe would generally be that employers have a month to report to HMRC, so that is the end of April, and I think something like 61 per cent of the data reported by employers on a timely basis would come through to DWP by the end of May. Assessment will be based upon the latest information that the commission has for an individual on a preceding-year basis. If data for 2006-07 comes through to the commission in May 2007 and a case comes in to the commission on 1 June, the assessment will be based on data from 2006-07. If that person came into the commission in April or May 2008, the assessment would still be based on that 2006-07 data until the next year&#146;s data kicks in. I hope that explains.</p>

From what he said earlier, I guess that the Minister&#146;s case will be that this will become a lot less contentious and more straightforward. We all hope and pray that that is right. However, when I was a solicitor in south-east Scotland, professional disputes of many kinds where you could not get two parties to agree were resolved by being taken to arbitration. There were different systems for doing that in different parts of professional and agricultural life. A person of skill came in who knew what they were doing, who had a bit of experience and a track record in the area, and in whose judgment people could have confidence, and simply cut the Gordian knot by making a recommendation. That finding was accepted by both sides and the world went on its weary way with the dispute resolved. This may again be perceived by the department as an extra complication, but in circumstances where there still may be confusion and disagreement between the assessments made, it is worth looking at in a probing amendment. It would be good to hear what the department feels is there by way of merit that might be used in deploying it.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000295"></a>Amendment No. 191, also in my name and that of my noble friend, looks at placing a statutory duty on CMEC to investigate a non-resident parent where there are grounds for suspecting that the information held regarding his income does not give the full picture. We have discussed that before. Indeed, Amendment No. 191 was run in the Public Bill Committee in the other place with a slightly different wording. The departmental response was that there would be a danger that the commission might be swamped with references for investigation, and that the future reliance on HMRC data would solve many problems. This amendment has been refined to make it clear that CMEC would be expected to investigate only where there really were grounds for suspicion, so that there is no prospect of any fishing expeditions without them. I hope that that new wording might be more acceptable to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000296"></a>Looking at why we need Amendment No. 191, there is no doubt that the agency and CMEC going forward will have a considerable array of methods and powers to investigate financial circumstances. As I understand it, the staff guidance at the moment says that decision-makers are not required at any time to undertake independent investigations. In practice, that leaves parents with care to prove the NRP&#146;s financial circumstances by themselves. As I argued earlier, I do not think that is fair. The balance is against the parent with care. I believe that the new system we are setting up should try to create a more level playing field, otherwise it will still be too easy for non-resident parents to evade their responsibilities. I beg to move.</p>

When calculating them there will inevitably be parties who feel an injustice has been done. It is virtually impossible to negotiate a perfect solution; but, as in life, I am afraid so it is in child maintenance payments. A decision has to be made at one point and reviewing and re-reviewing such decisions wastes precious resources to no great objective. It also sends out a message to non-resident parents that decisions made by the commission can be taken lightly and overturned. That would be a disaster because we would be back in the old ball game of the CSA for totally different reasons.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000298"></a>Of course, the commission must develop a human face&#151;we all agree with that&#151;and make accessible to parents a whole support network, but it must be seen to have conviction on its decisions. Of course, the decisions can be appealed and later we will have discussion on what level of appeal is appropriate in particular cases. Although they can be appealed, the commission must have conviction over what it does. That is absolutely essential.</p>

It is important that the new rules are seen to apply fairly. However, I do not think that these amendments offer the best way to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000300"></a>Amendment No. 94 provides for an independent assessment of self-employed income in a case where the figure used in the calculation is in dispute. We recognise that a minority of self-employed parents will want to try to obstruct the commission by giving income information which is incorrect or incomplete. We have already taken steps which will seek to deter them. The use of HMRC income data will mean that in fewer cases will information be required from non-resident parents, reducing the opportunity for them to directly mislead the commission. We are retaining the provision which means that knowingly giving false information will be a criminal offence, in the way that it is currently with HMRC and the Child Support Agency.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000302"></a>Amendment No. 189 proposes a change to the variations scheme rather than to the mainstream calculation. It would allow the commission to initiate the variations process itself instead of having to wait for a formal application from a parent. Although we recognise the concerns, there is a serious practical difficulty here. For the types of income likely to be considered in relation to a variation, the information received from HMRC is unlikely, on its own, to be

To initiate a variation in these circumstances would not result in a fair and equal system. However, we have listened to concerns raised about this matter and, as I intimated earlier, have tabled Amendment No. 101 which seeks to improve the variations scheme for parents with care.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000303"></a>Amendment No. 191 would require the commission to investigate a non-resident parent&#146;s income whenever a new maintenance calculation is made or a variations application considered. The commission will be able to undertake further investigations into a non-resident parent&#146;s income where appropriate. In supporting this process it will be able to obtain information from a number of sources, such as local authorities and accountants. If in the course of an investigation, it comes by information which may be of interest to HMRC, the commission will be able to pass that information on through the gateways.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000304"></a>We consider that this approach is preferable to investigating income in every case. The majority of non-resident parents are straightforward in their dealings with public bodies. The task of effectively double-checking income information would add greatly to the commission&#146;s workload and, in the case of independent assessment, would add to delay. In most cases, this additional effort would not change maintenance calculations. I would add that we are also retaining the power to estimate income where available information is unreliable, insufficient or atypical. We shall be working with the commission to decide how to make best use of that power.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000312"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 17 states that a calculation can be reconsidered only if the parent&#146;s income changes by 25 per cent or more. My amendments are not like the amendments we  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC550"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC550</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>discussed in the previous group&#151;that is, pernickety insistences on reviews and re-reviews. I very strongly feel that the bracket of 25 per cent before any change is made is too large. In essence, I said as much at Second Reading. From the non-resident parent&#146;s point of view, if his income has decreased by, say, 20 per cent, to lose one-fifth of his income, without the ability to have the maintenance calculation reviewed, could place him in the position of being unable to make his child support payments and/or provide for himself and any second family who might exist. This proposed 25 per cent rule will also disadvantage the parent with care, who is often the most vulnerable party in child maintenance negotiations. If there is a substantial increase in income for the NRP by perhaps even 20 per cent, it would seem illogical that the parent with care cannot share in this increase and have the assessment revised to produce the maximum amount of money flowing to the child.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000313"></a>I have tabled Amendment No. 98 on the advice of the Solicitors Family Law Association, Resolution. This provision would mean that no longer is it down to the non-resident parent to provide income information, but could be obtained by the commission direct from HMRC. Indeed, it should be done under the system proposed in the Bill. This amendment is tabled with the intention of producing quicker and potentially more accurate calculations than the Bill would produce. Does the Minister not also believe that it is imperative that the calculation, where possible, reflects the up-to-date income position of the NRP? This is a slight over-hang, and I might have asked the question during our tte- -tte towards the end of the last group of amendments that I moved. I am convinced that this amendment would also assist in alleviating child poverty: in cases where the updated information shows an increase in the non-resident parent&#146;s income, this will maximise any maintenance calculation.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000314"></a>Amendment No. 97 was drafted by Gingerbread, and is very sensible. It is a probing amendment to prompt a discussion on how CMEC intends to avoid the situation where non-resident parents can get a reduction in their child maintenance, but only face a levelling-up in a year&#146;s time when their liability is reset to the following year. Where, in a tax year, a non-resident parent&#146;s child maintenance is assessed on current income or where he is required to pay only the flat rate of maintenance, the amendment would require CMEC to retrospectively check, using HMRC data, that during the tax year in question, the NRP&#146;s actual income, as calculated for child support purposes, did not exceed the figure used to calculate his child maintenance by more than 25 per cent. If he did so, the non-resident parent should be made to pay the underpayment of liability. In another place, Ministers rejected an amendment which would have required non-resident parents to notify CMEC if their income rose by more than 25 per cent.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000315"></a>A non-resident parent will be able to switch to a lower current-year assessment if he can show that his income has dropped by 25 per cent or if he claims benefit. There seems to be no CMEC mechanism for revising this reduction, even if it becomes apparent in retrospect that the reduction in income or period on benefit lasted for only a short while, perhaps while he

That lower assessment will continue to apply for the rest of the year and will be re-evaluated only in the following year when he could&#151;I am ascribing motives to him, which I hope he would not have&#151;do the same again. This is far from desirable and there is a plain danger of abuse. I beg to move.</p>

We need to be careful as regards the figure of 25 per cent, which is a very steep cliff edge. In my Amendment No. 100, I suggest reducing the figure to 20 per cent. Under Amendment No. 99, there is scope for thinking about imposing a duty on the commission when constituted to come up with a low income protection scheme of some kind that is not too bureaucratic or onerous. That would give some comfort to those who have been following these proceedings and think that this is just a little bit of a bridge too far all in one go.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000317"></a>Amendment No. 97 seeks to allow retrospective review of supersessions so that we can prevent misuse of some of the supersession rules. The arguments were not run earlier in the Public Bill Committee in the House of Commons, but this amendment is designed to allow discussion of how CMEC intends to avoid a situation where non-resident parents can get a reduction in their child maintenance but only face a levelling-up in a year&#146;s time when their liability is reset for the following year.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000318"></a>In the Commons, Ministers rejected an amendment which would have required NRPs to notify CMEC if their income rose by more than 25 per cent. Again, we are trying to level up the playing field and put the parent with care in a stronger position. A lower assessment for an NRP would continue to apply for the rest of the year. It would be re-evaluated the following year when he could do the same again. There is a danger of potential abuse. The parent with care cannot apply for a variation because she has got no access to the financial information to which we have referred and have had discussions about earlier. In that circumstance, she is flying blind. Amendment No. 97 looks at ways to prevent misuse of that kind.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000319"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08020561000536"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Members of the Committee will be aware of our proposals for the statutory maintenance service to introduce a system of fixed term awards with annual reviews of maintenance calculations. In between annual reviews, maintenance will be adjusted only for a change in the non-resident parent&#146;s income if that change exceeds a tolerance level, which will be specified in regulations. As has been mentioned, we have proposed a level of 25 per cent. We believe that provides certainty for parents on the amount of liability, allows for significant changes in income to be reflected and will reduce significantly the volume of reassessment work carried out by the commission.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000320"></a>The commission will advise Ministers on the level at which the tolerance should be set, taking into account the potential impact on child poverty and  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC552"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC552</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what is possible operationally. It will be set out in regulations which, being subject to affirmative resolution, will be available for scrutiny by both Houses. The advantage of placing the tolerance in regulations is that it will be possible for the commission to review it in the light of experience and, if necessary, seek ministerial approval to change it.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000321"></a>Amendment No. 96 seeks to set the tolerance level in primary legislation at 10 per cent. Currently, the agency receives around 160,000 applications for a change of circumstances every month. Since 2003, a staggering 5 million changes of circumstances have been cleared by the agency for new scheme cases alone, which results in the agency spending far too many of its resources constantly adjusting maintenance liabilities. Many non-resident parents report repeated&#151;even weekly&#151;changes to their income and shared care arrangements.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000322"></a>For the commission to be successful, we need to avoid burdening it with the same level of re-work and reassessment that the agency has faced. Restricting the scope for in-year adjustments will help us to achieve this. Cases will be reviewed annually, and the income figures from HMRC will be updated so that they will always represent the latest available tax year. Analysis shows that between 2004-05 and 2005-06, 39 per cent of non-resident parents had an increase or decrease in income of 25 per cent or more.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000323"></a>If the tolerance were set at 10 per cent, that would hugely increase the volume of cases needing adjustment. For the period mentioned, 61 per cent of cases had an increase or decrease in excess of 10 per cent. Setting the tolerance level at 10 per cent therefore would not result in the reduction of reassessments needed for the commission to effectively manage its caseload, nor would it provide the desired level of income stability for parents.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000324"></a>We recognise that a tolerance for changes in income means that until the next annual review of the case, a non-resident parent who has had a significant drop in income will pay a higher proportion of their net income in maintenance. For example, a non-resident parent with one child who was earning &#163;20,000, whose income drops by 24 per cent to &#163;15,200, would have to pay around 20 per cent of their net income during this period. In a worst case scenario, a drop in income of 24 per cent would mean that a non-resident parent earning &#163;800 per week with three or more children to support, might pay around 34 per cent of their net income until their next annual reassessment. However, since only 11 per cent of all non-resident parents have three or more children, and only 2 per cent of all non-resident parents are likely to experience a drop in income of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, this scenario will be somewhat rare.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000325"></a>Amendment No. 97 applies to cases where a maintenance calculation has been adjusted for a reduction in the non-resident parent&#146;s income. The amendment would provide that where the commission subsequently receives information from HMRC that shows that for the period covered by the lower maintenance calculation the income was actually 25 per cent or more higher

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000326"></a>When a non-resident parent can show that their current income has fallen by 25 per cent or more compared with the figure on which their maintenance liability has been based, it will be possible for their liability to be adjusted to be based on current income. This type of adjustment is known as a &#147;supersession&#148;. Before the agency will carry out a supersession, it will require robust evidence that income has reduced for a period that is long enough to give a comprehensive and accurate picture of the non-resident parent&#146;s income. This minimises the scope for manipulation and ensures that figures are not affected by short-term falls in income or by seasonal fluctuations.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000327"></a>I assure noble Lords that the current rules that allow for a revision of maintenance liability that has been found to be based on inadequate or incorrect information will continue to apply under the new arrangements. This means that if a parent with care believes that the non-resident parent&#146;s income has not dropped by 25 per cent, the decision can be disputed and, if they do so within one month and are successful, the lower calculation will be changed from its start. If she successfully disputes it after the one-month dispute period, the lower calculation could be replaced from the date she disputed it.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000328"></a>If the commission subsequently receives information that shows that maintenance should not have been reduced because the non-resident parent had misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact, the lower maintenance calculation could be revised and the original higher assessment could be put back in place from the outset. There are already existing provisions in place to allow for a decision to be reconsidered in the circumstances envisaged by the noble Lord. It is worth pointing out, however, that data from HMRC will only ever reflect the most recent complete tax year. The current income figures provided by the non-resident parent would inevitably be for a different period.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000329"></a>Carrying out routine reconciliation of HMRC data, even if it were possible, would be a resource-intensive and potentially complicated exercise that would reduce many of the administrative benefits of basing maintenance on HMRC information, resulting in frequent minor overpayments or underpayments which would require adjustments to ongoing maintenance that would be complex for parents to understand and budget for and for staff to explain to them.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000330"></a>Under Amendment No. 98, regulations would provide that an immediate adjustment takes place where the maintenance calculation had been based on income data supplied by HMRC and the commission subsequently receives updated income information. A non-resident parent could submit new income details at any time and their maintenance calculation would be reviewed. This could have an overwhelming effect on the commission by creating unmanageable peaks  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC554"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC554</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in workload following the end of the tax year. To manage the system of annual reviews, the workload needs to be spread evenly throughout the year.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000331"></a>Amendment No. 99 would place a requirement on the commission to make proposals to protect low-income non-resident parents from too high a threshold. Noble Lords might consider that there should be a separate, lower tolerance for non-resident parents on low incomes, but that could add significant operational complexity and create other difficulties. For example, would the lower tolerance only apply to those already on incomes below a certain threshold, before their income falls? Or would it also apply when the drop in income itself brings the income level below the threshold?</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000332"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 100 seeks to limit the tolerance level to 20 per cent. As I mentioned earlier, the agency spends far too much time adjusting maintenance assessments, and we need to reduce the amount of similar work that the commission will be required to carry out. The analysis that I referred to earlier looking at income changes between 2004-05 and 2005-06, shows that around 44 per cent of non-resident parents had an income change in excess of 20 per cent. This is only 5 per cent different to the figure of 25 per cent but, given the likely scale of the commission&#146;s caseload, even a 5 per cent difference could have a significant impact on the volume of cases needing reassessment. As I said earlier, in due course the tolerance level will be set out in regulations, and there will be an opportunity to debate it then.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000333"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, cited an example where someone might be tempted to go from work onto benefit and back into work to try to defeat or get around the rules of assessment. I make it clear that if someone goes from unemployment to work, there is an immediate reassessment of the amount that is due. The range of circumstances is fairly limited where there is an immediate reassessment.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000334"></a>The question was also specifically posed why we are not requiring non-resident parents to report increases in income of 25 per cent or more, when they could be earning far more than the figures used in the maintenance calculations. For reasons of simplicity, we want to remain with the historic HMRC figure and avoid changes in liability wherever possible. If the non-resident parent has a large increase in income in any tax year, that will catch up with him when the maintenance is based on his income for that particular year. If a parent with care reports that the non-resident parent had an increase in income of more than 25 per cent and she has some evidence to support the claim, it would be investigated.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000335"></a>In conclusion, I suggest that a key difference of the new system proposed is that it will be possible for annual updating of assessments, which has not been possible under the current arrangements. Some assessments have been languishing unchanged for many years. This is a better system. Certainly at the margins it may be perceived as broad-brush, but that is the price that we pay for efficiency and being able to make those annual adjustments.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000339"></a>The latest available tax year information is all well and good, but by definition&#151;as the Minister said under a previous amendment&#151;it is always going to be at least slightly and possibly very out of date by the time that it is needed to be applied for the CMEC calculation. That is imperfect, but I admit that I cannot see any better way of doing it. It is rough justice, if you like. In some of my meetings with my honourable friends down the corridor, I have discussed this at some length and persuaded them that there is no better way. They have much better sources of advice on these matters than I do up here, but even with that they have not come up with a suggestion that is any better.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000349"></a>The noble Lord said: I was looking to see whether noble Lords had an appetite to close proceedings, but I am very happy to move Amendment No. 101 and to speak to Amendments Nos. 203 and 205.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000350"></a>Amendment No. 101 places a duty on the commission to make investigations into any application for a variation from the parent with care where it is clear that further evidence would help the commission to decide whether a variation should be given. In Committee in the other place, a number of amendments were tabled concerning cases where non-resident parents manipulate their income and avoid a maintenance liability which properly reflects it.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000351"></a>Although the Government rejected those amendments, we considered the representations that were made. We are aware that there is some dissatisfaction with how the variations process works and with how difficult it can be for a parent with care to provide the information needed to make a successful application. There are a number of obstacles either party may face when applying for a variation under the current scheme; for example, a lack of awareness caused by how the Child Support Agency currently functions. The parent with care and the non-resident parent are not initially informed of the variations scheme during the calculation process. If either feels strongly enough that the maintenance liability is unfair due to costs or income not taken into account, only then would the Child Support Agency inform the parties of the variations scheme. With that  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC557"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC557</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>approach, if the parents have little or no contact with each other, the parent with care may never become aware that the non-resident parent&#146;s liability does not accurately reflect his financial circumstances.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000352"></a>Once an application has been made, there is still a sift process. At that point, the agency evaluates the grounds of the variation and assesses the level of information provided by the applicant. If they do not meet the minimum requirements, the application is sifted out and no further action is taken. The other party will never be informed of the application. While non-resident parents have such an incentive to provide information on their variation applications and reduce the liability, they do not have such incentive on applications made by the parent with care. That is why we want the duty-to-investigate provision to apply for the variation applications made by parents with care.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000353"></a>Therefore we propose this amendment to the 1991 Act which will ensure that parents with care are able to secure variations where appropriate and will help to secure maintenance liabilities that more accurately reflect the non-resident parent&#146;s financial circumstances. The commission will investigate applications by using information already held&#151;for example, by HMRC&#151;or it will seek information from other sources, such as accountants, employers or credit reference agencies.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000354"></a>This change is part of a package of ways in which we can strengthen the variations scheme and overcome the obstacles faced when applying for a variation. We are also considering other changes that do not require primary legislation; for example, legally requiring non-resident parents to provide information about variation applications such that the non-resident parent would be subject to criminal sanctions if he or she did not comply. We are also looking into the feasibility of the commission developing a risk-profiling system to identify those non-resident parents who may have assets or income that could be the subject of a variation and to prompt the parent with care to apply for one. We also expect the commission to work to raise the profile of the variations scheme, especially at key points such as the initial calculation and the annual review.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000355"></a>Amendments Nos. 203 and 205 are minor and technical. They allow the commission access to information held by HMRC for the purpose of functions relating to national insurance contributions. I beg to move.</p>

This is obviously a welcome concession as far as it goes. There is no doubt about that, and the Minister deserves credit for introducing it. However, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was talking about applications for variations. I would like some more consistently collected information on applications for variations. Although there are people who make applications, there are more important questions about the follow-through: the number of applications for variations that are accepted by CSA decision-makers, the numbers then taken to appeal  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC558"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC558</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the outcome of those appeals. Although I accept that there may be a flurry of activity where there is nothing to lose, in the red rage that parents with care often get into, they will&#151;if they know about it&#151;make an application just on the basis that it is the only thing available to them, with no real prospect of success. We should be careful and monitor how the variation provisions pan out in practice when this legislation is in steady state.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000357"></a>I have already welcomed the amendment, and I may have misunderstood this but it will still put the burden on the parent with care to bring a variation application before the commission can intervene to give them access to the provisions in the new clause. We had discussions about this earlier. The amendment will not help such a parent with care unless she is alerted to the fact that an application for a variation might be appropriate. Indeed, although the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was evincing surprise that there was a big number&#151;it is a big number in absolute terms&#151;in proportion to everything else it is modest. We should be quite clear in this new system about what entitlements and abilities there will be for parents with care to make variation applications.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000358"></a>Unless I have misunderstood this, and I hope I have&#151;if I have, someone will put me right&#151;this does nothing to help the parent with care to know whether she has a chance of taking advantage of the new powers in Amendment No. 101. Welcome though they are, they will not do the job for that reason.</p>

<p><a name="08020561000376"></a>I hope that we hear about this later.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000360"></a>These three amendments, particularly Amendment No. 203 which refers to national insurance contributions, allow me to ask why this is going to be helpful to CMEC in the first place. I can well understand why the tax returns and all the rest of it are useful, but not why national insurance is. Are we talking about amounts or records?</p>

<p><a name="08020561000361"></a><b><a name="80205-gc0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08020561000545"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Picking up first on the points of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, he asked what data we have on successful applications, appeals and outcomes. We do not currently have detailed data on that, although some research is underway to look at this issue in detail. The key point is perhaps to recognise that we propose to shift it from how it currently works&#151;or does not work&#151;to try to make it more accessible. If we just shifted some of the issues I touched upon&#151;about how we currently communicate with parents with care about its availability and so on&#151;and nothing else, it would help. We are planning to do more than that.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000362"></a>The noble Lord is right. Standing by itself, the amendment would not provide a parent with care with any more information about whether or not they

We are looking at profiling to see whether the commission can use it to inform parents with care of the likely circumstances in which a variation may be appropriate. We certainly want to move on to a better system.</p>

<a name="80205-gc0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08020561000363"></a>On the information we will be providing to the commission to which it does not currently have access, the amendment will provide the commission with access to all information held by HMRC for the purposes of functions relating to contributions. While the majority of information held for contribution purposes is also held for income tax purposes and, as such, will be accessible to the commission, specific pieces of information, and information above a certain age, will not. The agency currently makes use of historic contributions information when it needs to create a historical profile of a non-resident parent&#146;s employment history in order to perform a maintenance calculation,  


<notus-date day="5" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC560"></a><b>5 Feb 2008 : Column GC560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or revalue an interim maintenance assessment. The commission will also require access to contributions information for these purposes. So there is certainly a particular opportunity there to go back into the past in trying to deal with these long-outstanding debts. That national insurance information will be helpful to the commission in helping it build an employment profile for somebody. I hope that deals with the points raised.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08020539000011"></a><b><a name="80205-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08020539000076"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Derek Twigg) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08020539000012"></a>As the Secretary of State for Defence informed the House on 10 January, a small number of UK service personnel who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years have received life-saving emergency transfusions of US blood. We had identified from US and UK records that 18 of these UK service casualties might have received blood or blood products from US emergency donors at their field hospitals where samples from the donor might not have had a valid retrospective test. There was no evidence that a blood-borne disease had been transmitted from a US donor to a UK service recipient, but there was a small risk for these individuals that a blood-borne disease was transferred without being detected. We therefore commenced contacting these individuals on 20 December last year to offer retrospective tests for these few individuals as a sensible reassurance measure.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08020539000013"></a>All UK service personnel who might be affected (or if appropriate their next of kin) were contacted personally by their own military or civilian GP. The precise means of communicating was decided by each individual GP, since they are the only persons able to balance all the factors affecting their patients' situation. In some cases, initial contact will not have been made face-to-face, whether because of the patient's location or other factors. I am satisfied that GPs acted appropriately in difficult circumstances and with their patients' welfare uppermost in their thoughts. However, by 11 January, all 18 patients (or if appropriate their next of kin) had been counselled on the advisability of having their blood tested and offered the necessary tests. It is of course the patient's right to decide whether to take any such test.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08020539000014"></a>An individual's tests will take two to three weeks to process. However, the blood samples should not be taken until a period of some months has elapsed since the transfusion took place. This means that not all the individuals in the group of 18 patients have yet had their tests completed.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08020539000015"></a>Patients have an absolute right to medical confidentiality either from direct disclosure of their personal information or from indirect disclosure resulting from the release of wider information. This means that in order to protect patient confidentiality in such a small group, the department is unable to reveal any further details, on either an individual or group basis, of the number of those contacted who elected to take the tests offered. This also includes revealing details of the results of such tests, whether positive or negative, unless explicit and informed consent is given by the patient concerned. Indeed, the

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08020539000016"></a>The MoD fully recognises the distress that this will have caused individuals. We continue to offer help and support to those to whom we have offered retrospective testing and to others who have become concerned as a result of the media coverage.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08020539000017"></a>Any blood transfusion carries some degree of risk. We and our coalition partners are committed to minimising those risks. The crucial point remains that an emergency blood transfusion from donors on or near the battlefield can be&#151;in some cases certainly has been&#151;the only way of saving the lives of gravely wounded UK personnel.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08020539000019"></a>On 25 July 2007, I announced that Vector Aerospace had been selected as the preferred bidder for the purchase of the DARA Rotary Wing and Components businesses at Fleetlands in Hampshire and Almondbank in Perthshire.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08020539000020"></a>Following a period of extended consultation with a wide range of interested parties including local MPs and trades unions and successful negotiations with the preferred bidder, I am now able to announce the sale of these businesses to Vector Aerospace for &#163;17 million. Vector Aerospace has also legally undertaken to retain the operational capability currently provided in the UK and has given a full commitment to meet all employment and pension protections. Throughout the sale process, it has remained our priority to secure the best decision for defence. First and foremost is the support we provide to our Armed Forces, who are so often involved in difficult and dangerous operations. Secondly, our responsibility also extends to securing the skills that exist currently in DARA for our longer-term requirements, while giving the loyal and dedicated DARA employees a secure future. These are objectives that my predecessor set out in November 2005 as part of our logistics transformation programme and which are wholly consistent with the defence industrial strategy, which has seen our key industry partners working with us to deliver operational capability to the front line on time and to budget.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08020539000021"></a>On current plans, these businesses have a finite life; privatisation could develop the business further, with the best chance of winning a share of new work in a sub-contractor role via the through-life contracts that we are increasingly placing with our key industry partners, as well as other work outside the MoD. It is therefore in the best interests of our colleagues on the front line and the DARA employees that we secure the best long-term solution, which allows the skills, expertise and on-shore capability to be retained for our future needs. Sale to Vector Aerospace not only offers the opportunity for investment and growth but provides us with operational certainty on a vitally

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08020539000022"></a>Vector Aerospace has a demonstrable track record of military aviation support both in the UK and North America and, more importantly, can sustain capability to surge and flex to meet defence operational requirements. Sale to Vector Aerospace is also supported by our key rotary wing industry partners, Boeing and AgustaWestland, who recognise the important role that Vector Aerospace will have in their future contracting arrangements. I must add that, before reaching this decision, we took into account the views, concerns and contributions of honourable Members, trades unions officials at every level and many others who have contributed to the debate on sale. I can confirm that we will continue to maintain a dialogue with trades unions and employees through to the completion of the sale. This announcement gives the work force clarity on this important and sensitive issue.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08020539000023"></a>Finally, I want to pay tribute to the excellence and professionalism of the DARA employees and their contribution in supporting those in our Armed Forces who rely on their skill and dedication, which is invaluable and recognised throughout the world.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08020539000024"></a>Following completion of legal and regulatory processes and in particular the need for Vector Aerospace to obtain a final Government Actuary&#146;s Department certificate for its broadly comparable pension scheme, it is expected that the formal transfer of ownership to Vector Aerospace will conclude shortly.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08020539000032"></a>On 30 January 2008, the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform submitted the Government&#146;s response to the European Commission&#146;s consultation on the future of cohesion policy. The response was drawn up in consultation with other government departments and the devolved Administrations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08020539000034"></a>Due to the scope of the questions asked in the consultation itself, the Government&#146;s response is formed of two parts. A covering letter is used to raise issues in relation to the debate on the future of cohesion policy that the Commission&#146;s questions do not address. This is followed by responses to each of the questions.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08020539000035"></a>The letter starts by putting cohesion policy into context, as established in the treaty; ie it contributes towards the overall aims of the European Union by addressing disparities in development between regions. The best way to address these disparities is through the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas; supporting the sustainable development of jobs and growth, noting that cohesion policy is not the only means of addressing this agenda. These themes are further developed in the answers to the specific questions.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08020539000036"></a>The letter then states that our response focuses on the shared aims of cohesion policy and that reform of

It highlights the three principles on which debate on the review should be based, as stated in Global Europe, and notes that in line with these principles a priority for reform will be,</p>
<ul><a name="08020539000075"></a>&#147;a significant increase in the percentage of structural funds to poorer member states&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08020539000067"></a>but goes on to acknowledge that the impact of significant changes to funding will need to be considered.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08020539000037"></a>Finally, the point is made that the debate on the future of cohesion policy is wider than the questions raised in the consultation and examples of other questions that could be considered are provided.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08020539000038"></a>The consultation questions themselves are divided into three themes. The first set of questions asks how far cohesion policy is adapted to addressing the challenges of globalisation, climate and demographic change. The Government&#146;s response is that cohesion policy should be driven by the integrated guidelines for jobs and growth and the national reform programmes (NRPs). The challenges facing European regions are not new and are already being addressed at a European, national, regional and local level. Cohesion policy should remain focussed on achieving sustainable jobs and growth.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08020539000039"></a>The second set of questions asks how cohesion policy can further develop an integrated and more flexible approach to growth and jobs in the context of these new challenges. Our response advocates a strategic approach to cohesion policy directly linked to the integrated guidelines and NRPs. The link to the NRPs should provide the flexibility for cohesion policy to add value to the policies relevant to each member state and within this framework allow regions to focus on their specific priorities.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08020539000040"></a>The final set of questions asks how well suited the existing policy management system would be to deliver the requirements identified in the response to the previous set of questions. In responding, we reiterate the approach set out to the previous set of questions and call for simplification and proportionality in the financial management systems. The benefits of co-operation activities are also stressed, as is the need for proper financial management.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08020539000041"></a>As well as being published on the European Commission&#146;s website, this response and covering letter will be made available to the public through the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform website. The response has also been brought to the attention of a wide variety of UK stakeholders, Members of the European Parliament and the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny committees. In addition, a copy of the response and the covering letter will be placed in the Library of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08020539000043"></a>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held in Brussels on 22 January 2008. The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury attended for the UK. The items on the agenda were as follows:</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08020539000045"></a>The Slovenian presidency of the council presented its proposed work programme for ECOFIN in the first half of 2008, which was followed by an exchange of views. As part of the agreed three-presidency approach, the Slovenian presidency will take forward the common priorities started under the German and Portuguese presidencies. These are ensuring efficient and effective management of economic policy; taking further steps toward the completion of the internal market; and improving the quality of the public finances. In addition, the Slovenian presidency will address economic reform issues ahead of the 2008 spring European Council and financial stability issues following recent developments in financial markets. The UK supports the proposed work programme.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08020539000069"></a>Ministers held an orientation debate on a range of documents related to the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs. These documents included the Commission's recently published strategic report reviewing the latest three year-cycle of the strategy, proposals for broad economic policy guidelines, country-specific recommendations and the community Lisbon programme.</p>

<a name="80205-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08020539000070"></a>Ministers agreed that the existing priorities of the strategy (knowledge and innovation, employment, the business environment, and energy and climate change) remained valid and that no fundamental overhaul of the guidelines was required. Member states should therefore prioritise the implementation of the agreed reforms. March ECOFIN will return to these issues and will prepare a report on these documents for the spring European Council.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08020539000071"></a>The council agreed a set of conclusions on the single market review. Ministers agreed priority areas for action, which include the rapid implementation of the services directive, efforts to liberalise network industries and promoting the free movement of knowledge and innovation. The UK welcomes the focus on these areas, which should help build a market-based, flexible, and outward-facing single market. These conclusions will inform discussions at the spring European Council.</p>

The White Paper that I am laying before the House today looks at the priorities of the Slovene presidency for the first half of 2008. The Slovene presidency will concentrate on the EU delivery agenda across a wide range of subjects, building on the positive successes of the Portuguese presidency, focusing on four key priorities.</p>

The UK agrees with the presidency that this treaty is key to the success of the EU, bringing an end to institutional reforms and a return to strong delivery both internally and with external partners. This change in focus will be essential to enable the EU to meet the varied challenges of globalisation.</p>

We will work closely with the presidency to assist it in taking this forward, rooted in a Global Europe approach. As part of this, the presidency is keen to increase innovation through a stronger focus on research and skills to prepare the EU for new global challenges, such as emerging markets and changing demographics.</p>

This authorisation replaces the Race Relations (Immigration and Asylum) (Language Analysis) Authorisation 2007, which has expired.</p>

The NHS has systems in place to identify pressures locally as they arise and respond appropriately. However, these are local arrangements and there is no national data collection measuring Norovirus prevalence or its day-to-day impact on hospital capacity. The Health Protection Agency assessment is that while Norovirus levels rose earlier than usual in the season, overall the pattern of increase in infections is consistent with that of previous years. All strategic health authorities are continuing active local management of their organisations facing the most pressure.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_49"></a><a name="08020555000125"></a>Available information relating to DNA samples indicates that approximately 690,000 DNA samples were taken without consent by police forces in England and Wales in 2006-07. The numbers of profiles derived from these samples which were actually loaded to the DNA database, broken down by force, are shown in the attached table. (Three forces did not return data and figures for these have been estimated). The numbers of samples taken and profiles loaded are higher than the number of persons involved, as some persons are sampled more than once.</p>

<a name="08020555000217"></a><b><a name="80205w0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08020555000314"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> As at 21 January 2008, the National DNA Database (NDNAD) held 362,812 profiles from individuals between the ages of 10 and 18 (up to their 18th birthday), from all forces in the United Kingdom, (this includes England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands). The number of profiles held on the database is not indicative of the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests.</p>

<a name="80205w0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_140"></a><a name="08020555000218"></a>At present, the replication rate is 13.3 per cent, that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent fewer than the number of profiles. Therefore, the estimated number of individuals between the ages of 10 and 18 as at 21 January 2008 is 314,558. Individuals who were under 18 at the time that a DNA sample was taken from them, but were over 18 on this date, are not included in the figures.</p>
