<A NAME = "80717-01_head0"></A><H3><center>Waste Minimisation Bill</center></H3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para0"></a>I think the feeling of the House is that this particular debate should be quite short, as I know a number of noble Lords are eager to start proceedings on the Landmines Bill. I also have to bear in mind the suggestion made by one of my noble friends who is a most righteous and generous man, although that was overlaid by the cynicism derived from many years' occupancy of the Whips Office which led him to suggest that, if I were seriously concerned about the minimising of waste, my speech should be exceedingly short in order to save paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para1"></a>However, this Bill is a virtuous piece of legislation. It has been bouncing around the House of Commons for a couple of years. I believe that it was originally suggested by a Conservative Member and was fortunate to survive the slaughter of the innocents which takes place in early July in the other place. Indeed, this year, only two Bills out of a very large number were approved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para2"></a>I believe that most people accept that we really must challenge the problem of waste far more vigorously. Despite the need for vigour in the field, the Bill is not of an extensive character; indeed, it is a brief Bill. It merely proposes to insert in the relevant Act of 1990 a provision which will allow waste authorities to take action which will encourage the reduction of waste.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para3"></a>Waste is an enormous problem. On average, every household in Britain produces such a tonnage of it that the total must now exceed 20 million tonnes a year. That is only in the domestic context; businesses produce much more. Some are taking steps to promote recycling and reuse, and these measures will help prevent the remorseless growth of this problem which besets our country. It may also be relevant in dealing with the problem of litter. That is a problem which requires much more urgent attention as our country is probably the most litter strewn in northern Europe today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para4"></a>I believe that the Bill will serve a useful purpose. I understand that a large number of local authorities strongly support it, and I know that a number of businesses do. I have been advised that the industry council concerned with waste in the environment is very supportive indeed. In view of the qualities of the Bill and the needs of our society, I commend it to the House.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNair: </B>   My Lords, this modest Bill has the support of my noble friends and I believe that it also has the support of noble Lords in all parts of the House. I feel particularly at home speaking for the Liberal Democrats on the Bill because it was during the Second Reading of the Environmental Protection Bill in 1990 that I made my maiden speech. As we have heard, this Bill is simply an extension of the provisions of that legislation. It is no less welcome for its modesty of power and scope, though I feel that it will give effect to many of those discussions that people have had over the years in which they ask, "Why don't they...?", and so on, to which the response is, "Well, the local authorities don't have any standing to do this". I believe that the Bill will give them that standing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para6"></a>Perhaps I may make one more general point about such discussions; namely, that, when talking about sustainability or "sustainable", I wish that people would qualify the word with one of the following adverbs--"economically", "environmentally" or possibly "biologically". Otherwise, it is most difficult to pick one's way through the cliches that build up around a subject which is much talked about.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para7"></a>The Bill will hearten all the voluntary groups which have been working in this field for a number of years, all the people of my generation who were ridiculed for talking about the environment in the early 1970s, and all the people who are working for organisations like Waste Watch. I believe that education is a very important aspect that this Bill might engender. Indeed, the citizenship education which was discussed under Professor Bernard Crick's advisory committee should include education on how to take care of the environment. If young people are encouraged to put pressure on local authorities, I am sure that the most use will be made of the powers in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para8"></a>I was lucky enough to attend a conference on economic instruments and waste management on Wednesday. I noticed the difference in culture between Britain and various other European countries. I very much hope that the effect of the Bill will be to change that culture so that we are more enthusiastic about minimising waste. As I said, I support the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hardy, for his explanation of the Bill. I take the opportunity, if the newspapers are to be believed, to wish him a happy birthday. We support the purpose of the Bill. There are some matters that we may wish to pursue in Committee. We have received representations--no doubt other noble Lords have received them--from the industry council for packaging and the environment. There is the matter of consultation with those who will be affected by any actions taken by local authorities, whether they are users of the packaging, users of the products, or the generators of the waste. We shall want to consider that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para9"></a>The council has made the point that we want to ensure that, in promoting waste minimisation, we do not look at things in isolation. Some waste items are not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>worth recycling as they may generate less waste in manufacture than recyclable waste and may be produced with fewer resources than recyclables. Those are matters that we shall want to examine in Committee and seek to redress any concerns. Apart from that matter, we on these Benches support the Bill and its Second Reading.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, this Bill will allow local authorities, where they choose, to investigate and promote methods of minimising the amounts of waste generated within their areas. I thank my noble friend Lord Hardy for taking it forward. I join in wishing him many happy returns of the day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para10"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord McNair, said, this is a good Bill and a timely one. It clarifies the existing legislative position about whether local authorities can undertake waste minimisation activities. Although some local authorities undertake initiatives on waste minimisation, many do not because of a lack of clarity in the existing legislation. The Bill will remove that uncertainty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para11"></a>We generate 26 million tonnes of municipal waste each year in England and Wales, 90 per cent. of which comes from households. There is evidence that the amount is growing steadily as more households are created and as personal consumption increases. Therefore action must be taken to reduce the amount of waste put out for disposal. This is an important issue. That importance has been re-emphasised by the Government in the recent consultation document Less waste: more value. The simplest and most effective way of dealing with waste is to ensure that it does not arise. The Government want waste minimisation to be an important focus of our strategy and we believe that the efforts being made by many households on recycling can be extended into reducing waste.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para12"></a>In the past waste minimisation has received less attention than recycling. Local authorities have tended to treat the amount of waste produced as something over which they have no control, and which they have to manage. We have not been getting the waste minimisation message across as successfully as we need to, partly because of the uncertainty I have mentioned about what local authorities may actually do. This Bill starts to address that problem. It will allow local authorities, for example, to inform householders about some of the straightforward actions that they can take: for instance, stopping junk mail. It will not empower an authority to impose requirements or restrictions upon individuals or businesses within its area. The Bill is about the acts of local authorities, not those of other parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para13"></a>We hope the Bill and the new waste strategy which is now being prepared will help to raise the overall level of awareness about waste and waste minimisation. I am sure it will. We have found that, in areas where waste minimisation initiatives have taken place, people start to think seriously about the waste that they are producing. That is a vital step towards a more sustainable society. As the noble Lord, Lord McNair, said, it is vital that young people's interests in these issues are harnessed to <P>


<a name="column_498"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 498</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>achieve this end. I slightly disagree with the noble Lord, however, when he said that young people need to be encouraged to consider environmental issues. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, that the Government are committed to ensuring consultation, as our document shows. The Government welcome and support this Bill. I commend it to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the helpful and relevant comments which have been made. I have not had much contact with the noble Lord, Lord McNair, but I served with his father on the Council of Europe for a long time and we enjoyed an extremely cordial relationship. The point he made about sustainability should echo much more volubly throughout the land because we have to manage the world's resources rather more intelligently.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para14"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, for his pertinent comments and for his felicitations. I had not expected any Member of your Lordships' House to note the date. I had forgotten it, but I am grateful to the noble Lord and to my noble friend for mentioning it. I hope that we can have a constructive, if relatively brief, debate in the further stages of the Bill. It is extremely encouraging to have the support of the noble Lord and his colleagues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-01_para15"></a>My noble friend will not be surprised to hear that I am delighted to learn--I am sure the House is also delighted--that a strategy is being prepared. This problem needs to command attention. I hope that the Government's strategy will be assisted by this modest Bill. I was glad to hear my noble friend's comments and also the brief comments made by the noble Lords, Lord Bowness and Lord McNair. I trust that this cross-party support will ensure that the Bill has a happy and successful passage. I hope that the House will give it a Second Reading.

<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para0"></a>Anti-personnel landmines kill. They maim. They kill and maim indiscriminately. They continue to kill and maim long after those who laid them have stopped fighting. We all know these facts. They have been <P>


<a name="column_499"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 499</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>repeated frequently in recent months and years, as the world's attention has focused on the issue. But repetition does not make them any less chilling.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para1"></a>The scale of the problem is enormous. Indiscriminate, irresponsible laying of millions of anti-personnel mines across the world in unmarked and unmapped minefields has brought physical suffering, hardship and anguish to hundreds of thousands of victims and their families. Every 20 minutes, another innocent person falls victim to a landmine. About 60 million mines lay scattered in 70 countries, keeping refugees from their homes and wreaking havoc for many of those who take the risk of returning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para2"></a>Last week, when this issue was debated in another place, fitting tributes were paid to Diana, Princess of Wales and others, including the Nobel peace prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines and the Red Cross movement, in recognition of the tremendous effort they put in to ensuring that the world takes action to deal with this problem. I should like to take the opportunity today to endorse those tributes completely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para3"></a>We can all be proud of the way that Britain has been at the front of the international campaign to turn words into action since this Government took office in May 1997. Among the first things we did was to address the landmines issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para4"></a>Within a week, the Foreign Secretary had made a joint statement with his French and German colleagues, confirming that we would give particular priority to banning anti-personnel mines worldwide. Two weeks later, we said there would be a domestic ban on the import, export, manufacture and transfer of landmines, an immediate moratorium on their use, and that we would destroy our stocks. We also said that we would take part actively in the Ottawa Process, with a view to signing an effective international ban on landmines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para5"></a>We must also thank the Canadian Foreign Secretary, Lloyd Axworthy, for establishing the agenda for an international ban. He stood up at the close of the Ottawa conference on mines in October 1996 and set December 1997 as the target date for a convention. There can be no doubt that in doing so he galvanized the international community into action.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para6"></a>Britain was closely involved in negotiating the convention in Oslo last September. Securing agreement on a final text in less than three weeks honoured the memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died so tragically on the conference's eve. We were delighted to be among the first countries to sign the Ottawa convention last December. There are now 128 signatories: a truly remarkable achievement in so short a period.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para7"></a>Having helped write the convention, we now want to help bring it into effect. That is why we are here today. In passing this legislation now, we should ensure that Britain is among the first 40 countries whose ratification will secure the convention's entry into force; 24 states have already ratified. Several more are expected to announce their ratification soon.
<P>


<a name="column_500"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para8"></a>If we and others can take this step quickly, the convention will be in effect early next year. That would be a wonderful tribute to the hard work and dedication of all involved in the campaign to rid the world of this deadly scourge. It would also send a powerful signal to those who have not signed the convention. It would make clear that the world community will not tolerate the continued use of anti-personnel landmines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para9"></a>We need this legislation to implement the Ottawa convention. The Bill is entirely consistent with the convention. Clause 2 prohibits any British citizen from using, developing, producing, possessing or exporting landmines. And it also outlaws any assistance, encouragement or inducement for others to do any of these things. Anyone found guilty of breaking the law in this regard would be liable for a prison sentence of up to 14 years. That reflects the gravity of such and offence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para10"></a>Concern has been expressed about Clause 5 of the legislation. Let me allay those concerns. Clause 5 does not provide British service personnel with any loophole to breach the convention. Any such breach would be punishable under the terms of this legislation. The rules of engagement under which UK service personnel operate will make this perfectly clear. What Clause 5 does do is provide British service personnel with protection against prosecution merely as a result of taking part in operations alongside troops of states not bound by the Ottawa convention who may lay such mines. Providing such legal protection for our forces is absolutely the right thing to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para11"></a>Of course, we want every country in the world to agree never to use anti-personnel mines again. We have made our wishes and views on this clear. Both by persuasion and example, we shall continue to encourage as many as possible to sign up to the Ottawa convention. But we cannot force others not to deploy such mines. And we cannot ask our servicemen and women, when risking their lives for our country, also to risk their liberty for doing nothing more than carrying out their duty. Without Clause 5, we would effectively be withdrawing Britain from any military operation alongside states which have not signed the Ottawa convention. What more comforting signal could we send to the tyrants of this world?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para12"></a>In drafting Clause 5, we have taken our cue from the Canadian declaration that accompanied their ratification of the Ottawa convention. That makes clear their understanding that Article 1 of the convention is not intended to rule out military co-operation with countries that are not bound by the convention. We know that the Austrians, who drafted the convention, take the same view. We intend to make a similar statement on ratification, reflecting the provisions of Clause 5.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para13"></a>Clause 5 also highlights the problem of trying to ensure that every country in the world bans landmines. When they have done so, our service personnel will not require the protection that Clause 5 affords. But we are a long way from that and our work to get as many countries as possible on board must continue. We are encouraging work in all appropriate fora, including the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, in pursuit of this goal.

<A NAME = "80717-02_para14"></a>But the Ottawa convention is not just about banning the use of anti-personnel landmines. It also provides for the destruction of stockpiles, the removal of laid mines, and care and assistance for mine victims.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para15"></a>On destruction, Britain has a very good story to tell. In accordance with the destruction programme announced by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence, the MoD has destroyed almost half its stocks of these mines since 1st May last year, and good progress is being made towards the target of destruction of all operational mines by 1st January 2000. As far as we are aware, no other government have done as much to destroy their stocks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para16"></a>Britain is among the world's leaders in mine clearance assistance to the worst affected countries. Last October we announced that we would double expenditure on humanitarian de-mining from &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million per year. The purpose of our de-mining strategy is to reduce the social and economic impact of landmines on developing countries. Our first priority is to save life and facilitate resettlement in the most severely affected countries, such as Cambodia and Mozambique.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para17"></a>Our task then is to secure a truly global ban, which will lead to the elimination of these weapons and end this wholly unnecessary suffering. The best way to help to achieve this is to lead by example. This legislation and our subsequent ratification of the convention will do just that.

<A NAME="80717-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   My Lords, at the start of this Second Reading debate on the Landmines Bill, intended to implement the Ottawa Convention, I want to begin by saying how much importance we on this side of your Lordships' House place on this legislation and the opportunity for a full and thorough scrutiny of it. I am indeed grateful to the Minister for her opening remarks, which are most welcome. I believe that there will be a consensus in this House that it is vital to give proper consideration to any legislation which contains implications for British service men and women whom we ask to risk their lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para19"></a>Before I go any further, I should like to place on record the support of these Benches for the spirit of this legislation. We are united with the Government in our desire to see a global ban on landmines. A truly global ban on such inhumane and vicious weapons would represent the triumph of humanity over barbarity, of civilisation over chaos, and of the forces of peace over the pollution of war. From these Benches we are unwavering in our condemnation of the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines. Landmines continue to wage an amoral war on the innocent and vulnerable long after the conflict that caused them to be put there has ceased.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para20"></a>Once in place, these silent soldiers, encased in their metal or plastic armour, mark out a permanent no man's land in the ground, where in times of peace, just as in <P>


<a name="column_502"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>times of war, no one can walk safely. Their deadly purpose is undeterred and unaffected by armistices and truces, preserving indefinitely the bitterness and the fear of the strife of the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para21"></a>Landmines respect no international humanitarian law or carefully crafted peace treaties, but instead violate them arbitrarily and without warning. They do not distinguish between the soldier and the civilian. They are truly the unacceptable face of war, the face of human suffering beyond belief, and the harbingers of social havoc and economic hardship writ large across dozens of countries in the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para22"></a>No one can fail to be moved by the tragic plight of the victims, as was so eloquently put by the Minister today. We are all only too aware of the random and cruel manner in which innocent civilians have been killed or maimed. Indeed, many Members of your Lordships' House have witnessed the appalling tragedy caused by the reckless use of these most destructive devices of war. I have no doubt that we will hear compelling and harrowing testimonies to this effect today. In the past my noble friend Lady Chalker has reminded us that:

<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para23"></a>Testament, indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para24"></a>The Minister was right to point out some statistics to set this legislation in context. Additionally, in mine-infested Angola and Cambodia there is more than one mine for each member of the population. In Cambodia there is one undetected mine for every four people. In Angola, one in every 334 persons is an amputee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para25"></a>It is against this terrible background of destruction and devastation that I pay tribute to the pioneering and tireless work of individuals, campaign groups and non-governmental organisations alike who have done so much to raise the issue of a total ban on landmines in the public consciousness and who have worked so hard to ensure that this legacy of torn limbs and ruined lives is not one we bequeath to our children and our children's children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para26"></a>A special mention must go to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Halo Trust, founded by the former Member of Parliament, Colin Mitchell, and the Mines Advisory Group. The contribution of the Nobel Prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which has brought together more than 100 different organisations, likewise deserves global praise and recognition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para27"></a>It would be quite wrong not to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the role of the British forces in providing mine clearance advice and support. In this country, we have always been one of the leading nations working to clear up landmines and we have committed some &#163;22 million to mine clearance projects around the world since 1991. Excellent de-mining work has been done and is being done by so many, both in the voluntary sector and with the help of the services in this country. I am sure that the Minister will agree that <P>


<a name="column_503"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>initiatives on international mine clearance are of equal importance to the quest for a global ban on landmines. The argument for an aggressive clearance policy is a strong one, particularly given the unlikely prospect of a total global ban on landmines. But it does stand or fall on whether more landmines are being cleared or laid. At the moment, more are being laid.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para28"></a>The Minister again was right to point out that in recent weeks much has been written and said about the unique and invaluable role played by Diana, Princess of Wales, who, in lending her support, her time and her commitment to this cause, brought the issue of landmines to the forefront of public awareness in a way that perhaps no one else could.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para29"></a>We would all like to see this legislation on the statute book as soon as possible. Indeed, the official Opposition has repeatedly stated that we support the spirit of the Ottawa Convention. As long ago as February we made it clear that we would co-operate with the legislation needed to allow the convention to be ratified and would not seek at any stage to obstruct it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para30"></a>As I said, from these Benches we fully support the moral motive behind the convention and behind this legislation. That is why we will continue to support it today. But the Bill must be placed in context. Its purpose is to ratify an international convention which will impose a partial ban on certain weapons. This imposes two imperatives on us. First, because those weapons will continue to be in widespread use, considerations for the safety and the integrity of British troops must be paramount. Any relevant legislation requires meticulous drafting. Secondly, any Bill drafted to implement an international convention signed by the Government must have no inconsistencies with that convention. If it does, we would be most remiss in our duty of legislative scrutiny if we did not ask why, for the signature of the Government of the UK binds us legally and morally to legislate to implement that convention faithfully. This, then, is the task we embark on today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para31"></a>I should like to point to the work that has been done prior to today in building up to the consideration of this Bill by previous administrations. Like the previous administration, in the absence of a global ban, the Government in this Bill appear to recognise the legitimate use of anti-personnel mines under certain extreme circumstances and to distinguish between modern deployment of them by responsible military powers, such as the UK in the Gulf War and the irresponsible use, often during civil wars, by warring factions and guerrilla forces. Even today, buried in the financial memorandum of the Bill before us, the Government acknowledge the need to examine and procure alternative technologies to meet the military capability previously provided by anti-personnel mines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para32"></a>On that note, I wish to ask what steps the Government will take to ensure that the ban does not lead to greater dependence on air-blast bombs and booby-traps which can be equally indiscriminate, last just as long and be harder to defuse than modern mines. Furthermore, can the Government confirm the date on which their right to use anti-personnel mines, if the security of British forces is jeopardised without their use, as stated in the May <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>1997 policy statement, will be given up, in accordance with the Ottawa Convention? When, in December 1997, the Government signed the Ottawa Convention, which the legislation before the House today is designed to implement, the difference between the approach of the Government and of the Opposition was signalled a little more clearly--not because we oppose the spirit of the convention (which is why we shall not oppose the Bill); far from it. It was because we sought a truly global, multilateral ban on landmines. We took the view that the best route to advance the Ottawa process was through the conference on disarmament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para33"></a>We favoured the conference on disarmament route because of the limitations of the convention that resulted from the Ottawa process. It is not churlish to recognise those limitations; indeed, it is essential if we are to be successful in taking the process further. At least a quarter of the world's states have refused to sign the convention. Many powerful and significant countries are not signatories, critically including the United States of America, China and Russia. None of those countries has accepted Ottawa. The convention cannot therefore introduce a truly global ban; it can only hope to lead by good example. It is a fact of international life that, unless all the major manufacturers and exporters of mines agree to a ban on their sale and use, landmines will continue to be used as an inexpensive means of denying territory to opposing forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para34"></a>In 1996 the previous administration managed to go a long way towards persuading China to agree not to export undetectable landmines. I shall be interested to hear from the Government today what steps they are taking to address the problem of how to persuade countries that export, produce or misuse landmines to change their policies in a similarly successful way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para35"></a>I now turn to the areas of specific legislation before us, which, from these Benches, we intend to scrutinise more fully in Committee. Those areas include Clause 1 which provides definition of the main terms used in the Bill; Clause 5, which the Minister has already flagged, which provides a defence to a Clause 2 offence relating to certain international military operations; and certain other questions on the wider international legal implications of a breach of the convention; the destruction of mines in the Falkland Islands; the storage of non-state party landmines in the United Kingdom; and the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para36"></a>Let me make myself clear at this point. It is not the scope or the content of the legislation which we wish to examine carefully. Nor is it a question of separating the Bill from the convention it is designed to implement and seeking to weigh up the merits of what it does or does not achieve. It is the inconsistency between the legislation and the convention which it purports to reflect faithfully which we shall want to examine in detail when we return to the Committee stage next Friday.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para37"></a>I hope that by next Friday we shall have a little clarification from the Government regarding definitions. Broadly speaking, for the purposes of the Bill, an anti-personnel mine is a victim-operated device. <P>


<a name="column_505"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 505</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, in this critical legislation I suggest that the broad definition is not sufficient. It is vital that what is and what is not included within this legislation is established beyond doubt, for the definitions have major implications for many of the clauses throughout the Bill. Any technical problems therefore with those definitions are clearly of key importance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para38"></a>The Foreign Secretary confirmed that JP233 anti-personnel landmines, used in association with anti-airfield weapons, are prohibited by the Bill. Likewise, the US Gator type is prohibited. However, I understand that the Shielder vehicle scatter-launch mine system, which is produced by the same company as the Gator system, is not covered by the Ottawa Convention since it is for anti-tank use. US Claymore-type directional fragmentation mines are also permitted because they are not victim activated but are remote-command detonated by soldiers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para39"></a>During Committee stage it will be helpful if we consider the opinions of experts--such as Colin King, editor of Jane's Mines and Mine Clearance--who do not believe that such a black and white line can be drawn to distinguish anti-personnel mines from anti-tank mines, given that Claymore mines can easily be adapted to anti-personnel use simply by screwing in a fuse and given that the mine used by Shielder has a highly sensitive magnetic-influence fuse which would cause a person stepping on it to set it off immediately.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para40"></a>Furthermore, in Committee I shall be pressing the Minister to tell the House what status is accorded to booby-traps under the Bill, given that the distinction between mines and booby-traps is often unclear. Many booby-traps operate on similar principles to mine fuses. Some mine fuses can be used as booby-traps and, as I understand it, the two are frequently interchangeable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para41"></a>We must also compare the Bill with the treaty that it is intended to put into effect. We shall need to examine in detail the relationship between the Ottawa Convention and the Bill. For the most part, the clauses within the Bill reflect and mirror those in the convention, with--as already signalled by the Minister--one glaring exception; namely, Clause 5. I am grateful to the Minister for comments which certainly added to the Government's position as explained in the House of Commons last Friday.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para42"></a>From my perspective, Clause 5 sets out certain exemptions to prohibited conduct during international military operations and is intended to provide a defence for anyone who would otherwise be guilty of conduct that is prohibited by Clause 2 of this legislation. I should like to say straightaway that this is not a question on the merits or necessity of Clause 5; it is solely a question about the consistency of the Bill with the convention. Article 1.1 of the Ottawa Convention was clear and unambiguous. It reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each State Party undertakes never under any circumstances: (a) To use anti-personnel mines; (b) To develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer to anyone, directly or indirectly, anti-personnel mines; (c) To assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under this Convention." <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_506"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 506</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para43"></a>I do not believe that anyone can construe any doubt or confusion as to the meaning of Article 1.1 of the convention. It expressly prohibits assisting,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para44"></a>I hope that, in summing up, the Minister will confirm that that is the Government's understanding.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para45"></a>The Foreign Secretary in another place said that there is no inconsistency between the Bill and the convention--I am grateful to the Minister for repeating that assertion this morning. The Foreign Minister said that the Bill gives full effect to the terms of the Ottawa Convention and Clause 2,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"faithfully and fully puts the Ottawa convention into British legislation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para46"></a>Clause 2 certainly does serve that purpose. It not only prohibits British service men or any other British citizen from using, developing, producing, possessing or exporting a landmine, but it also prevents them from assisting, encouraging or inducing anyone else to do so. However, in Clause 5 we have exemptions. It sets out the exemptions for international military exercises and states that a soldier would not be guilty of a crime as long as he is not actually laying the mines. That defence applies to joint operations conducted overseas with the armed forces of another government in the course of which there is or may be some deployment of anti-personnel mines by members of the armed forces of one or more states that are not party to the Ottawa Convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para47"></a>If Clause 5 is consistent with the Ottawa Convention, where is the corresponding clause in the convention? Perhaps the Minister can help me, for I have been unable to find it. There is no getting round it: the Foreign Secretary said that Clause 5 has a limited purpose to provide British service men with a shield against unreasonable prosecution if, for example, they took part in a NATO exercise in which US troops deployed landmines and that it does not provide British service men with any loophole to take part in the deployment of landmines. Whether or not it is intended to have a limited purpose, the fact remains that the wide drafting of Clause 5 expressly permits conduct which the convention expressly forbids.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para48"></a>Can the Minister confirm that, according to Clause 5 as it stands, British forces are permitted to do anything other than actually lay anti-personnel mines? Is it not the case that they can procure, transfer, modify, adapt or even prime landmines as long as they do not actually lay them? How is it possible to argue that Clause 5 as it is currently drafted is purely prudential and serves only to protect British troops from being criminalised by the actions of troops from non-signatory countries who may be taking part in the same operation?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para49"></a>We shall return to this in very significant detail next Friday. But let me make it clear that I have no doubt that the Ministry of Defence had good reason for the inclusion of Clause 5 and the need for British troops to be able to operate in this way. No one is suggesting that British service men who place their lives in jeopardy should in any way find that their liberty is placed at risk as a result of this legislation. This is not an issue of whether Clause 5 is needed, although I would like <P>


<a name="column_507"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>confirmation from the Minister that the Foreign Secretary was correct to say that without Clause 5 the mere presence of British officers at a NATO planning meeting could be a contravention of the Bill's criminal law provisions. What is at issue is that Clause 5 as it stands is absolutely and explicitly contrary to the provisions of the Ottawa Convention. It is not what the Government negotiated in treaty form in Oslo and signed up to in Ottawa; and if such a clause is necessary, that should have been reflected in the convention itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para50"></a>One of the great advantages signalled in another place last Friday was the ability of great legal minds to bring their powers of analysis to bear in your Lordships' House. I have no doubt that both today and next Friday we will hear from those Members of your Lordships' House. But there are wider implications of international law which they will be more able to address than certainly I can. The inconsistency between the convention and the Bill drafted to implement it throws up a number of wider legal issues and implications which I am sure the House will examine.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para51"></a>Can the Minister confirm that, if other state parties determine that Clause 5 amounts to an exemption or reservation from the Ottawa Convention, which under Article 19 allows for no reservations and is therefore inconsistent with the UK's obligations under the convention or, more generally, inconsistent with the spirit of the convention, those state parties will be able to take up the procedures for verification of compliance and settlement of disputes as set out in Articles 8, 10 and 11 of the convention?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para52"></a>These articles provide that if there are concerns about a state's compliance with the treaty, clarification may be sought through the UN Secretary-General and, if necessary, a meeting of state parties may be held. This meeting can decide to send an obligatory fact-finding mission to the relevant territory of the state concerned for up to 14 days. On the basis of the mission's report the meeting of state parties may propose corrective actions or legal measures in accordance with the UN Charter. A definitive opinion might then be sought from the International Court of Justice. Although the Ottawa Convention does not contain a jurisdictional clause explicitly conferring jurisdiction on the International Court of Justice, Article 8.19 does provide for the initiation of appropriate procedures in conformity with international law. Given that the United Kingdom has issued a declaration accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the court, can the Minister confirm that it could be open to another signatory to initiate proceedings against the United Kingdom in the ICJ if it felt that the UK was in breach of the convention?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para53"></a>Furthermore, is it not the case that if this were to go against the United Kingdom, the Government would have the choice of amending domestic legislation or withdrawing from or seeking to amend the convention? In the light of that, what consultations and discussions did the Government have with other state parties on the inclusion of Clause 5 in the United Kingdom legislation to implement the convention? I will be returning to that point in greater detail at the Committee stage next week. <P>


<a name="column_508"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I should be grateful if in the meantime the Minister could consider some of the questions that I have put to the House on that specific point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para54"></a>Again, with courtesy to the Minister and her officials, I should like to flag up two points that we wish to raise through the procedure of amendments next week. Given that the convention obliges the Government to clear mines laid in the Falkland Islands, and given the strong arguments that resources for global mine clearance should be prioritised in accordance with risk, what are the Government's intentions on the many thousands of landmines that remain in position in the Falklands? Given that the United States has stockpiles of anti-personnel landmines in Britain, what are the legal implications of the Ottawa Convention for the storage and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines by non-state parties in the United Kingdom or in the UK's dependencies, such as in Diego Garcia?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para55"></a>In Committee I shall also be raising questions concerning the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill. For example, can the Government offer any estimate of the costs that they expect to arise from the need to examine and procure alternative technologies to meet the military capability previously provided by anti-personnel landmines? Is there any estimate of the costs of cancelling any supply contracts, which are referred to in the memorandum? There is the possibility that industry will face compliance costs. But, according to the Government, those have yet to be quantified. When do the Government expect to quantify such costs?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para56"></a>These are all important matters and must be addressed. But from these Benches we give an undertaking to support the Government in their intention and to have a speedy progress of the Bill through the relevant stages into law. We shall honour that undertaking even though the Bill as it stands, without explanation, appears to suffer from some major and serious defects of drafting. In its current form the Bill contravenes the Ottawa Convention and would then put the country in breach of its obligations under that convention and make us depart from our long-standing tradition of honouring, ratifying and implementing in every detail the treaties and conventions that we have signed. For that reason we would be derelict in our legislative duty if we settled for cursory scrutiny and chose to ignore the serious defects.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para57"></a>I assure your Lordships that at the Committee stage of the Bill we shall not be pushing these specific points to votes, but I hope that we shall have the opportunity for a comprehensive and serious debate to seek answers to the many important points that have been raised in another place and to some of the issues that I have raised today.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="80717-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the comprehensive speeches made by the Minister and by the speaker for the Opposition with regard to this important Bill. I wish to add my words to what they have said about the effect of landmines. In many ways landmines are the scourge of the poorest countries in the world and the poorest people in those <P>


<a name="column_509"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>countries and have the terrible effect of not only worsening war itself and the violence of war but also depriving people of the benefits of peace. Indeed, many Members of the House, not least the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, have seen the terrible effects of landmines in countries such as Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, Angola and Mozambique. One of the most awful legacies is that it becomes almost impossible for civilian populations to begin to rehabilitate their countries after the effects of war have otherwise ended because landmines put so many people at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para58"></a>In another place the Foreign Secretary made the dramatic point that in the course of the period in which he was speaking no fewer than 20 people would have been blown up by landmines and that many of those people would have lost their lives or lost their capacity ever again to lead an active and full life. So it is right and appropriate that we are addressing the Landmines Bill. I echo what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. No one in the House wishes in any way to impede, obstruct or delay the passage of the Bill. Certainly, speaking for my party, I give a pledge that we will do everything we can to assist the Government in getting it on the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para59"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, I wish to say a word of thanks to all the individuals, many of them unknown and unsung, who have made a tremendous contribution to this convention and the instruments that now follow to ratify it. Apart from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Mines Agency, the Halo Trust and the Mines Advisory Group, it is appropriate to mention two individuals. One is the noble Lord, Lord Deedes, who has made a great contribution to bringing this matter to the attention of the public; and no one at this solemn moment can forget the astonishing capacity of Diana, Princess of Wales, in being able to illuminate causes and turn them into matters that attracted and brought behind them the full commitment of many thousands of human beings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para60"></a>I want to pay tribute to Canada. As the Minister said, that country has played a crucial part in the creation of the momentum that made this convention possible. One should also add that Canada has played a most distinguished role time and again in world diplomacy on issues of human rights, humanitarian behaviour and in trying to end suffering. We are proud to see Canada as a member of our Commonwealth and recognise all that she has achieved, and continues to achieve, in this field.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para61"></a>I wish to say a word about the consistent commitment of my own party to landmines legislation. It is fair to say that before any other party, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, who has himself frequently visited Bosnia and other parts of the world, has investigated and studied the laying of mines and whether they can be lifted and disposed of. He deserves tribute on this occasion because his engagement has not been simply that of a legislator but as an active seeker after an attempt to end this particular form of warfare.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para62"></a>We are delighted that the Government have now taken this opportunity. I hope that it means they will enable the United Kingdom to be one of the crucial signatories as one of the first 40. The speed at which <P>


<a name="column_510"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 510</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>countries are ratifying the convention is so great that we should do our very best to ensure that the United Kingdom is among the first 40 signatories because it is a country whose citizens included Diana, Princess of Wales. Therefore, it seems singularly appropriate that we should be among those who ensure that this convention is brought into force. As your Lordships know, it requires 40 ratifications to achieve that. It is very important, in memory of Princess Diana, that we should be among the first 40.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para63"></a>Having said all that and having added the great tribute that we wish to pay to Her Majesty's Government for having already destroyed, as I understand it, over half of the existing stockpile of landmines in this country and for the work that they have done in training some 2,000 workers in the training offices of the Ministry of Defence in an attempt to try to correct this scourge, it is right and proper that we thank the Minister, the Foreign Secretary and indeed the Chief Whips in both Houses for getting this legislation through at a rapid pace.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para64"></a>I now turn to three difficulties which arise under the Bill. Because the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, has gone into great detail on this, I do not need to repeat everything he said. However, from the point of view of a party which is passionately in favour of this legislation, I wish to say something about why we in another place took the view that the present outcome in Clause 5, which qualifies the Bill, raises questions about compatibility with the convention, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said. In that connection I wish to pursue one or two aspects of that clause for a moment or two.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para65"></a>I believe that it is very important, as far as possible, to have legal views on this matter from this House, which is particularly well qualified to give them. Two questions arise and one was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. We share his concerns. Clause 5, in a sense, appears to pick out the one action of laying mines as the one objection that could be raised to British troops being engaged in joint actions, joint peacekeeping operations and possibly even joint military operations like those in the Gulf. Does it suffice to meet the convention simply to specify this one action of specifically laying mines and make that the centre of the issue of the legal objection to British troops being involved in that single aspect of such exercises? As the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, pointed out, and as the convention says quite explicitly in Article 1.1, there is a whole range of activities that the convention clearly rules out. It makes it clear that that is without reservation, qualification or any capacity to amend the statements in the convention. They do not include only the laying of mines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para66"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, quoted Article 1.1, but I again remind the House of it. The activities include the use of mines, their procurement and a whole range of associated operations. In Clause 5 we are taking out just one of those activities. We are, to use a common phrase, "cherry picking" one activity only and saying, "This is the one on which we shall concentrate and it is this one that will be in breach of the convention should a joint exercise involve British troops in so doing".
<P>


<a name="column_511"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para67"></a>I was very disturbed by the statement made by the Minister for the Armed Forces in another place. He specifically said--I believe I have his words before me--that Clause 5 would not prevent British forces engaging in co-operation in military exercises; in planning and arranging exercises which might involve the laying of mines by non-signatories to the convention--by those countries which have not ratified it even if they were conscious and aware that landmines were being laid in that joint operation. He made it plain that in his view that would not be caught by this Bill. I find that quite hard to understand.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para68"></a>I move on to the second point. I do not want to labour the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. The second point as regards Clause 5 is a very different one. We know--and we may as well be honest about it in this House--that the main reason for Clause 5 is that the United Kingdom is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and that the central and most significant power in that organisation is the United States. We also know that, partly because the United States perceives the laying of mines as a crucial defensive posture with specific regard to the borders between North and South Korea, and because she does not yet see an alternative form of defence against what is unquestionably a very strange rogue state in the shape of North Korea, at this stage the United States is reluctant to agree to sign the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para69"></a>There is a second reason which the United States gives--and I pay tribute to this--that she has destroyed all the landmines in her arsenal that were not self-destructive. Indeed, we have the word of the American Defense Department on 30th June that the remaining 80 landmines in the American arsenal that were not self-destructive were in fact eradicated. There are now no mines in the American arsenal that are not supposed to be self-destructive. As many noble Lords know, the problem is that the belief in mines being self-destructive has an element of euphoria about it. It is not quite correct that all so-called self-destructing mines in practice do self-destruct. One cannot allow civilians back into agricultural areas, their own towns, villages and cities if, say, 10 per cent. of landmines may not have been cleared. That is the difficulty. While I recognise that the United States is trying to move in the spirit of reducing the consequences of landmines, she herself would admit that she sees no possibility of ratifying the convention, to use the words of President Clinton, before the year 2006. That represents a great many innocent civilian deaths.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para70"></a>I must ask the Minister my next question quite directly. Why does the United Kingdom feel--I understand that it is on the basis of legal advice to the Foreign Office--that we have to go as far as Clause 5, when other loyal members of NATO see no obligation to undertake such a very wide-scale exception from the terms of the convention? We know that France has signed the convention without making any such exemption in legislation. Although not a full member of NATO, France is a planning and strategy member. Germany, which is a full member of NATO, has not, as far as I know, introduced legislation along these lines. We know that Canada, the author and begetter of the <P>


<a name="column_512"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legislation, felt it sufficient to put forward a declaration--it is not legislation--when it ratified the convention, making it clear that Canadian troops would not be at risk if they engaged in joint military operations, provided that they did not actively engage in activities which included the laying of mines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para71"></a>When in another place my honourable friend the spokesman on defence and foreign affairs for the Liberal Democrats raised the issue of whether it is possible to define the provisions of Clause 5 more narrowly by referring to "active engagement in the laying of mines in military operations", he was told (for reasons which to me are not adequate or clear) that that did not have the Government's support. I have to ask why, if the legislation unqualified on the one hand or a declaration attending upon ratification on the other hand are adequate for our allies in NATO, they are not adequate for us and why we have to go this further step which appears--here I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan--possibly to put at risk the full-hearted ratification of this crucial convention. I ask in all good faith since I am not, thank God, a lawyer whether the Government can throw more light on why they believe that it is essential to take this further step.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para72"></a>I do not want to detain the House, but perhaps I may raise briefly two or three other issues to which we shall return in Committee. I refer first to whether the provision for training does not appear to go rather far in terms of the provision for landmines which will be accepted within our ratification of the convention. I should like to probe a little the Government's reasons for believing that considerable numbers of landmines must be preserved for the purpose of training. Perhaps they feel that that is essential if we are to provide also for the training of other countries. Here, I pay a warm tribute to the Secretary of State for Defence for his great attention to the fact that Britain can provide expert help to other countries in dealing with this scourge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para73"></a>I shall not pursue my second question in detail now. It relates to the difficult issue of anti-tank mines. I raise this because I have spoken to the United States authorities and I understand that they believe that their most recent form of anti-tank mine, which includes within it an anti-handling device, is, unfortunately from their point of view, caught by the convention because of that mine's specific configuration. This point was raised in another place. I understand that the method called Shielder, which is the British form of anti-vehicle and anti-tank mine may (or may not) be so caught. There was no clear answer to this question when it was raised by Members of another place. It would be helpful if the Government could throw some light on the distinction between anti-vehicle and anti-tank mines which are or are not caught by the convention. Merely referring to whether the mine in question does or does not have an anti-handling device does not answer the question, given that the American system, which is caught by the convention, contains an anti-handling device.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para74"></a>My final question is more positive. I understand that a number of countries are now researching and working on devices which may be able to find and destroy mines in the many existing minefields around the world. I understand that one such system involves clasping the <P>


<a name="column_513"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mine in an extremely hot device which then blows up the mine. The trouble is that one first has to know where the mines are located. To my mind, the more exciting development is the so-called "red eye", which I believe is a Dutch development, which enables a wheelbarrow- like device to be taken over minefields and to detect the mines as it goes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para75"></a>I cannot think of any area of scientific research that would be more to the credit of this country, with its remarkable capacity in this area, than that. I am delighted that Her Majesty's Government have provided more money in their recent Comprehensive Spending Review for what is sometimes called "blue sky" or pure research. Could the Minister tell us something about research in this critical area? I can think of nothing that would be more to the credit of the country that invents successful devices for dealing with both plastic mines and the more traditional forms. Perhaps the Minister will be able to say a little more about the current research and how promising she believes it to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para76"></a>I repeat that this is a crucial Bill. My party and I are honoured to be part of its passage.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-02_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly to say how much people in the Churches welcome the Ottawa convention and its ratification in this Bill. This is not the time to elaborate on the devastating effects of such weapons. They are well summed up in the description of General Sir Hugh Beach that they,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Never miss, strike blindly and go on killing long after hostilities have ended. They are the greatest violators of international law, practising blind terrorism". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para77"></a>Many people and organisations have worked for a convention such as this. The General Synod of the Church of England debated the subject last in 1994 and called upon Her Majesty's Government,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Urgently to seek an international and legally enforceable ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para78"></a>That resolution was passed by 287 votes in favour and none against. So, there is very widespread, strong and understandable support for the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para79"></a>In 1994 there was some ambiguity in the then Government's position on so called "self-destruct" mines. As we have just been reminded by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, with a failure rate of one in 10, those mines can have terrible consequences for civilians. I take it that that ambiguity has now been eliminated. Nevertheless, as the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, reiterated, there are still ambiguities about certain classes of weapon and about whether or not they are included in the provisions. It would be good to hear from the Minister whether there is any such ambiguity and, if so, whether it can be eliminated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para80"></a>As we have heard, Clause 5 was the focus of some serious exchanges in the other place. We have heard compelling reasons as to why this whole issue needs to be examined thoroughly. I can understand why the Ministry of Defence wishes to protect our troops in this way. I also appreciate the answer that the Foreign <P>


<a name="column_514"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 514</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary gave in the other place. I should like to hear something further about whether Clause 5 is, indeed, compatible with the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para81"></a>However, whether or not that clause is compatible with the convention, none of us would want its provisions to lessen the sense of urgency about getting the convention fully ratified by the whole international community. As I understand it, major manufacturers of landmines, such as China, Russia and Pakistan, have not yet signed the agreement. As we know, the United States will not be signing it until 2006.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para82"></a>This is one of those issues on which dedicated campaigning organisations have achieved a most notable breakthrough and the Government are giving a clear lead. The unequivocal words spoken in another place are worth repeating. It was said that this Bill,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will ensure that no British soldier will ever use an anti-personnel landmine again; no British company will be allowed to manufacture anti-personnel mines; no one anywhere will ever be able to acquire our anti-personnel landmines from a British source and our operational stockpiles of anti-personnel landmines will be eliminated".--[Official Report, Commons, 10/7/98; col. 1407.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para83"></a>It is good to hear those words. Yet two major tasks still lie before us: to persuade the whole international community both to sign and abide by the convention and to clear the existing minefields. We know that about 60 million landmines lie scattered in more than 70 countries ready to kill or maim innocent civilians.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para84"></a>I hope that the Government will feel encouraged, first, to use every effort to persuade other countries to ratify the convention and, secondly, to contribute all possible resources to clearing existing anti-personnel mines as quickly as possible.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, many more of your Lordships want to take part in this debate. I shall thus be brief.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para85"></a>I most warmly welcome the Bill and congratulate my right honourable friends the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secretary of State for International Development and all their ministerial colleagues on fulfilling a further manifesto commitment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para86"></a>This measure is widely seen outside Westminster as the "Princess Diana Memorial Bill" and deservedly so. Her humanity was nowhere more eloquently expressed than in her work to limit the appalling human cost of landmines. Estimates vary but one is that more than 100 million landmines still lie scattered in 70 countries across the world, indiscriminately killing and maiming their innocent victims, even as we speak here today, and further impoverishing many of the world's poorest nations by preventing the growing of food and reducing the availability of clean water supplies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para87"></a>Diana, Princess of Wales, became the patron saint of landmine victims with her high profile visits to Angola and Bosnia. Yet one year later nothing much has changed. The funding of operations to clear mines is still woefully inadequate, and over 300,000 of the people so far injured by them are still left waiting for the help they need. Sadly, more and more of them die unregarded and unhelped with every passing week.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para88"></a>Ken Rutherford and Jerry White of the Landmine Survivors Network--themselves both victims of landmines--recall the Princess accepting their suggestion that she should visit Bosnia with them to meet other victims and how, to no avail, some people in Whitehall tried to dissuade her from going.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para89"></a>This reminds me of the raucous and persistent attempts made to dissuade the Co-operative Bank from its ethical stance in campaigning to end British involvement in the making and selling of landmines--an offence that will now be punishable, under the terms of this Bill, by a prison sentence of up to 14 years. The bank's moral leadership, so clearly vindicated by the Bill, is honoured by everyone who recalls today the extent and ferocity of the criticisms to which it was subjected. I do so as former President of the Co-operative Congress, the movement's highest office. At the same time, I pay tribute now, as I did then, to my noble friend Lord Thomas of Macclesfield. He was then, as Terry Thomas, the bank's chief executive and acted in the highest traditions of the Co-operative movement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para90"></a>Princess Diana told her dissuaders that she was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"fed up of being a poster princess," </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para91"></a>and wanted to get her hands dirty. In doing so, both in Bosnia and Angola, she gave hope to landmine victims everywhere. One of those she met, 15 year-old Mirzeta Gabelic, lost her right leg when she stepped on a landmine as she took a short cut across a field on her way to the market. "She had real feeling", says Mirzeta. "It wasn't like talking to an important person and Diana said she would help us get the materials we needed for a new bedroom". But since the Princess's death, three weeks after her visit, Mirzeta's lot has not improved much. "For a time", say Ken Rutherford and Jerry White, "those she visited felt someone cared, someone who could make a difference ... governments wanted to get on board and there were big promises of money. Then Diana was killed and the phones didn't ring any more. We've lost the momentum".
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para92"></a>I hope profoundly that this debate may be of some help in restarting the momentum. Princess Diana wanted and worked tirelessly not only for a total ban on landmines but for meaningful help for their victims. We owe it to her and to them now to address their needs with renewed urgency. Not to do so will be to leave the severely disabled people to whom Diana gave hope both doubly disadvantaged and in double despair. I am sure that in her reply my noble friend will want to endorse the urgency of their compelling claim to our attention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para93"></a>Today's debate is a most appropriate occasion for reminding ourselves also--I speak as a former Minister of War Pensions--how deeply indebted all of us are to the victims of landmines for whom the British Limbless Ex-Servicemen's Association (BLESMA) speaks with such well-merited authority. The Bill is about saving people from mutilation. BLESMA's work is about giving more dignity to the remaining years of limbless ex-service people, mainly war pensioners over 70, who are already mutilated. They lost their limbs, acting on our behalf, that others across the world might live in peace and security. Your Lordships' House needs no <P>


<a name="column_516"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 516</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reminding of their sacrifices on our behalf at El Alamein, at Anzio, at Arromanches, in the Ardennes and other scenes of great valour by our Armed Forces. Nor does this House need any reminding that those who were mutilated then deserve well of all of us now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para94"></a>With advancing years the problems of disability intensify and multiply. BLESMA recently put to my noble friend Lady Hollis and her department a proposal for two new age additions to the war pensions of ageing war pensioners. It would be deeply appreciated by the ex-service community as a whole if acceptance of that proposal could be timed to coincide with the enactment of this Bill as further evidence of the Government's commitment not only to ban landmines but also to make life better for their victims.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para95"></a>Total spending on war and war widows' pensions will cost &#163;137 million less this year at constant prices than in 1993-94. This is not because the value of individual pensions and allowances has been reduced, but because the number of pensioners is falling year by year as their average age increases and more and more of the war disabled and bereaved die.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para96"></a>The new help, of minimal cost, now sought by BLESMA for the most needful of its members could thus very easily be met without increasing the totality of spending on war pensions in the year ahead. To help them would be a most fitting way of giving irrefutable proof that this Government really do care.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I speak in this debate with a good deal of emotion, but I first declare three interests. I am the honorary Colonel of 156 North West Transport Regiment of the Royal Logistic Corps, and as such have a great deal of contact with young soldiers, particularly some of those giving their time as TA soldiers in Bosnia. I am a trustee of the board of the British Red Cross, and I am a non-executive director of the BayGen Power Group, the relevance of which will become clear later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para97"></a>I welcome the Bill. I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Moynihan for the thorough speech that he made, which means that I can be all the briefer. I, too, believe that there are some tributes to be paid. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, paid a tribute to my noble friend Lord Deedes, who is not able to be in his place today, but his willingness to go into some of those unpleasant places, which I know all too well, and then to write about them, talk about them and explain them has had a great deal of effect on the work that has been done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para98"></a>I pay tribute also to Chris Moon--an amputee who has been helping the British Red Cross to get this message across. The message that must emanate from this debate and our debates next week must be on three counts. It is not just the banning of landmines which is critical; it is education about landmines; and the clearance of landmines. There is a threefold message that we must send from this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para99"></a>The Bill is a critical means to a vital end. Without dwelling upon it, I share the deep anxiety expressed by my noble friend Lord Moynihan about Clause 5. Having <P>


<a name="column_517"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>read the Ottawa Treaty and the explanations thereof provided by the ICRC, I know that there is a great deal to be sorted out in the next seven days. I have confidence that the Minister and her civil servants will put their minds to resolving this matter. I implore her to do so, because it is important, not just for this country, but to persuade those countries which are not yet willing to ratify, to explain the detail of why we should proceed in the way that the Government have advised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para100"></a>There is one more thank you I wish to express. It is to the Secretary of State for Defence. When the right honourable George Robertson attended the landmine conference only a few weeks ago on 24th June, which he will remember well the Bill was not on our parliamentary agenda before the Summer Recess. The questioning in the opening session, which he handled remarkably well, convinced him that something had to be done, and it has been done. Although I was sad that he was unable to announce that morning that the Bill was coming forward, it is now with us, and we must be grateful for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para101"></a>There are many aspects to the work that has gone on in order to arrive at this point. As my noble friend Lord Moynihan said, I have seen the ravages caused to innocent people by landmines. It was in 1991 that I first went to Angola and saw the destruction of anything that one could call life for those already exceedingly poor people. There was a lack of prostheses at that time and a huge need.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para102"></a>But I suppose that it was Bosnia in 1992 and, thereafter, Somalia, particularly around Hargeisa in Northern Somalia, Mozambique and many of the other countries to which this country has for many years given good advice and sound development assistance, which impressed on me the need for this landmine ban above all else.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para103"></a>I remember the first time I visited the fields outside Lobito in Angola. I walked along, with guidance obviously, to the area which was then being de-mined. I heard from the Halo Trust, which has done such outstanding work, just how long it takes to clear a hundred square metres of what should be agricultural land. I was shown a small landmine. I nearly brought a casing with me this morning, but I believe that it is against the rules of the House to do so, so I refrained. A small landmine was tucked in under the bank of a pathway. People had walked along that path for some time--children to school, women to collect water. They were people going about their daily business. Nothing had happened. Then one day, perhaps because of rain or because the soil had begun to break up, a foot was placed at a slightly different angle at the edge of the path and the entire area and the people walking along the path were blown apart.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para104"></a>We have a real problem with children, farmers, and water carriers, but also refugees. Refugees, by their very nature are fleeing from their own conflicts. They go to adjacent areas which, frequently, have been mined. We shall only be able to tackle those problems when the banning of landmines has been achieved across the world.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para105"></a>We have heard many statistics today. I shall not repeat them, but I will give one or two others. The UN Landmine Action Centre considers that at present only 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. of the land minefields of Bosnia-Herzegovina have been identified. We have soldiers there. Many others have soldiers there. There is a huge job to be done. I mentioned that, because it is important to realise it is not just a question of long-past wars, but recent wars have exacerbated this problem to a huge degree.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para106"></a>We know that metal detectors, prodders, and trained dogs do an excellent job, but it is not enough, when every 20 minutes one victim is killed or maimed. It is worth concentrating our efforts also on finding new ways of detecting landmines. That is where the BayGen Power Group connection comes in. Many noble Lords will remember the wind-up radio invented in this country. That technology is now being produced in radios and torch lanterns in South Africa by disabled people. It is being extended. In the battle to get rid of landmines, a discussion with the American Department of Defense led to a new research opportunity for BayGen with Battelle Industries in the USA. I am glad to say that work is proceeding well, although slowly, on a wind-up landmine detector. That is important because no electricity is required. It is always in the hands of the operators. Noble Lords will be aware that there has to be back-up power because of the delicacy of operation which will be undertaken by such a piece of equipment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para107"></a>With new equipment, and indeed education on how to observe where landmines might be, and with the Bill, we may be able to achieve real success. I believe above all that it is not just the research that I and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, have mentioned that is important; it is vital to educate even illiterate people about the dangers of landmines and how they can be avoided by diagrams and methods that people can understand. It is through education in the schools of those countries so badly affected by landmines that we can make a real difference and at least reduce the number of people who are being killed or maimed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para108"></a>I very much welcome the Bill. Your Lordships' House has an excellent record for sorting out those matters in legislation which, perhaps through rushed presentation in another place, have not been finished properly. We look forward to doing that. But do not let us stop just at banning the anti-personnel landmines. Let us do those things that my noble friend Lord Moynihan and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, stated. Let us make sure that we educate, and undertake proper research, in order to get on with the huge job of clearing all those mines we know are hidden across the world which can destroy and hinder life for so many people.

<A NAME="80717-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kennet: </B>   My Lords, we have had a remarkably constructive debate; and I hope to keep it that way. We have had the inevitable and justified song of praise for the landmine treaty and the actions of our own Government in complying with it in advance, in destroying the mines and ceasing training in mine warfare. That praise is due, and the rejoicing is justified. <P>


<a name="column_519"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It has been one tiny, painful step forward in the now, I hope, irreversible march of humanity away from the values of war and torture.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para109"></a>I turn to one practical point about the Bill: Clause 5. Almost every speaker has found fault with Clause 5. The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, found extraordinarily vigorous fault with it. He described what was wrong with the clause with a force and precision which are unusual in this House. I know that it was meant constructively. I hope that it will be taken that way and that we shall benefit from what he said. It seemed to me that he had the right solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para110"></a>First, I address a mythical character. He is the man I think of in my mind as "that sapper". He was mentioned in the House of Commons debate and has been mentioned here outside the Chamber. He is a sapper who has built a bridge, having been ordered to do so and with no particular idea what it was for. He then finds that the American or Turkish army--let us not forget that there are two NATO powers who are non-signatories--has taken a landmine across it. According to this contentious myth, he would then become liable to 14 years in prison under Clause 5 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para111"></a>There is an easy way out of that: it is to read down to Clause 6. We find that anyone who inadvertently helps America or Turkey towards laying a mine is in the clear. From the language in the Bill, so long as he did not know that what was in the box was a landmine, he is in the clear. That surely would apply to building a bridge. So long as he did not know what was intended to go across it, he would be in the clear. I think that that argument need not hold us up too much.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para112"></a>The position of the Government on this is rather broad. The Bill allows the British Army to assist and encourage the laying of landmines or to take part in the transfer, acquisition or disposal of landmines for the purpose of laying, by a non-signatory country. It allows it in the sense that anyone who does that is not liable to the penalties as described in Clause 5. It is Clause 2 which sets out the offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para113"></a>We have to ensure that British people operating alongside the Americans are not open to prosecution. The best way to do that--it may well be the only way--is to ensure that they should not operate alongside the Americans in any operation or exercise where the Americans want to lay mines. There is not likely to be any country in Europe where they wish to do that; and I do not envisage NATO going frequently to Korea. We all have reason to hope that the Americans will soon forget all about landmines: once they have a Korean settlement, which may well now be within their grasp.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para114"></a>There is not, and will not be, a consensus in NATO for laying mines. All but two NATO members are adhering to the convention. Much the simplest solution to the problem is that NATO operations should not include the laying of landmines. There is wide support for that. There has been a questionnaire to NATO member governments, during the drafting of the convention. I have not seen the responses; I have seen the questions. They are extremely thorough. Presumably the responses to that were overwhelmingly positive to <P>


<a name="column_520"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 520</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the idea that a ban is a ban, and that is that; and that their people (of whichever country is responding) may not take part in planning to use anti-personnel landmines. If that is the consensus, we must remember that NATO operates by consensus. It is the form of democracy which operates in this great alliance of democratic countries. It would be a pity if that consensus were to founder on the refusal by two members to adopt the latest arms control treaty. NATO consensus can work either way, and a consensus does not exist in Europe for using landmines in any circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para115"></a>But let us remember also how enthusiastic President Clinton used to be for a total ban. "America will lead", he said. Then the Pentagon said no, remember Korea where millions of mines are planted, and millions more could be if the North Koreans came pouring down the peninsula. We owe it to the world to encourage the Americans to return to their early enthusiasm. It is not conversion that is required, but simply a return to the justifiable position they earlier occupied.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para116"></a>I wish to raise a new point which has not been mentioned in the debate. It is about the effect of Article 5, and the policy based on it, on other arms control conventions that the United States has not signed. I refer in particular to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to the inspection regime of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Senator Helms will not allow either of those, and if they are joined on the shelf by a third--what would be the general effect in the world?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para117"></a>If we allow our soldiers to collaborate with a non-signatory in preparing for the latter to lay mines, how can we object to the Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons tests? They have not signed the non-proliferation treaty. The United States has not signed the Landmines Convention. But unless we are categorical about the latter convention, how can we be categorical about the others? If our legislation contains loopholes for the sake of collaboration with the United States in one area of arms control, what is to stop others producing loopholes for anything they please?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para118"></a>I want to quote something Dr. John Reid said in the House of Commons debate when asked what would happen if an American commander gave the order to lay landmines to British troops under his command. He answered:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our troops would not carry out such an order because, for them, it would be an illegal order".--[Official Report, Commons, 10/7/98; col. 1387.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para119"></a>That is good. That is the rock basis of the affair. It is what we want to keep our eyes on and adjust the remainder to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para120"></a>I heard what the Minister, in introducing the Bill, said about the need for a provision such as Clause 5. But let us take courage from the fact that, as far as I know, no other country has found it necessary to have such a clause in its legislation taking on board the convention. Germany will not be taking any step in this direction. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, has already pointed that out. The French will not be taking any step in this direction and will not be co-operating with the Americans in any exercise or plan which involves the Americans laying landmines.

<A NAME = "80717-02_para121"></a>The Canadian Government declaration is attached to the text of the convention, and it stops short of our wording. In my opinion, it is a preferable form. It does not dwell in detail on the many ways in which we shall be able to help a non-signatory. With the leave of the House, I should like to read it into Hansard. The declaration states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is the understanding of the Government of Canada that, in the context of operations, exercises or other military activity sanctioned by the United Nations or otherwise conducted in accordance with international law, the mere participation by the Canadian Forces, or individual Canadians, in operations, exercises or other military activity conducted in combination with the armed forces of States not party to the Convention which engage in activity prohibited under the Convention would not, by itself, be considered to be assistance, encouragement or inducement in accordance with the meaning of those terms in article 1, paragraph 1(c)". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para122"></a>That is Article 1 of the convention. I suggest that that form of words is fully satisfactory and does not carry the disadvantages which appear in Clause 5 of the Bill. I hope that in Committee a solution along those lines will prove possible.

Throughout, she made it clear that the Bill applies only to anti-personnel mines. I hope that the Bill will be passed before the Recess and I fully support it. Today, we have an opportunity to ask for more information and to put questions to the Government about the effects of the Bill.

I served throughout, until I was wounded and partially disabled at the end, the day before Hitler committed suicide. I acquired an unenviable familiarity with enemy mines, including anti-personnel mines. My first observation is that the Bill is deliberately restricted to anti-personnel mines and does not apply to all landmines and to other types of mines. That is because it follows the Ottawa convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para124"></a>However, during the Second Reading debate in the other place, the right honourable gentleman the Foreign Secretary, in introducing the Bill, referred throughout simply to landmines. The words "anti-personnel" did not pass his lips. He said:

<A NAME = "80717-02_para125"></a>It does not do that. That statement is incorrect. The Bill refers only to anti-personnel mines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para126"></a>The Bill attempts to separate and to define anti-personnel mines as distinct from anti-tank and anti-vehicle landmines, which are not prohibited by the Ottawa convention.

<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para128"></a>Did he really mean our stockpile of all landmines, or does that figure apply only to the anti-personnel mines which we possess? That must be made clear. Will the Minister confirm that our stocks of anti-tank and other types of landmine are not affected by the Bill? That is important because the British Army should not be deprived of the other categories of landmine until perhaps another international convention applies to them and until all the major military nations have accepted it. The Ottawa convention has not been signed by the United States or by the main exporters of landmines; that is, Russia, China and Pakistan. We will be setting a very good example to the rest of the world by enacting the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para129"></a>A fact that has not yet been made sufficiently publicly clear is that the United Kingdom has not sold or provided any of the anti-personnel mines which have caused the most distressing injuries to civilians and children in areas where what I call "tribal wars" have taken place; for example, Cambodia, Angola and the former Yugoslavia. I ask the Minister to confirm that fact. Nor have British troops laid any of these mines. Any mines laid by the British Army in the past 60 years have been fully recorded and are later lifted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para130"></a>In the reverse direction, the British have taken the initiative in removing these mines. British voluntary organisations started the international movement to lift anti-personnel mines laid indiscriminately during the tribal wars to which I have referred, in particular the organisation Halo, to which my friend and colleague, the late Colonel Colin Mitchell, devoted the later years of his life. That organisation still carries out that life-saving and limb-saving work. Besides our military connection, Colonel Mitchell was my PPS in the other place during some of the time when I was a Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para131"></a>It is my understanding that no British firms have exported anti-personnel mines for the past 25 years or more. I should be grateful for confirmation of that. British troops have had the difficult task of clearing mines in the Falkland Islands since the 1982 war. They are all Argentine mines, not ours; and they are not just anti-personnel mines, they are anti-vehicle mines, too.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para132"></a>I ask government spokesmen and parliamentarians to avoid making general statements about a global ban on landmines without making it clear whether they are referring only to anti-personnel or to all landmines. Otherwise, they will be inadvertently misleading or confusing the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para133"></a>My first experience of anti-personnel mines was in the last two years of World War II. The Germans had introduced a small, sensitive mine made of wood. It did not respond to our mine detectors, which registered only metal. It was called the schuhmine. In Holland, in October 1944, after some tough fighting, we found that the enemy had withdrawn during the night. At first light, leading troops of the Scottish Infantry Division, in which I was serving as a Major, advanced, disturbed only by some desultory shelling and mortaring. I was on foot with my walkie-talkie and radio operator. The soldiers in front were sweeping with their mine detectors. I was suddenly aware of an unusual explosion, <P>


<a name="column_523"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 523</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>then another. Two men of the Gordon Highlanders, because that was the regiment, had stepped on schuhmines. They were behind the mine detectors but they were also behind me. I can tell your Lordships that that is an alarming experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para134"></a>The schuhmine, as would be expected from its name, blew the foot and boot off the soldier who stepped on it. Of course, we continued our advance. That was the wisest option. I reported the situation by radio to warn others. The medical section and the stretcher bearers had to take the same risks in order to reach the casualties.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para135"></a>We had been briefed about that new German anti-personnel mine, but at that time our detectors were useless against them. Your Lordships will understand why I have a special interest in banning anti-personnel mines concerning which this Bill is the first step. Your Lordships may now be thinking that I stepped on a mine myself, my disabled legs and sticks being a legacy. That did not happen. I was wounded months later by a bullet through my middle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para136"></a>Anti-tank mines casually laid in recent global wars can be dangerous too. Here I come to a case that I knew well. Only a few years ago, a young cousin of my wife, Mr. Alan Stewart, leading a television team covering the civil war in the Sudan was killed when his Land-Rover hit a randomly laid mine. That was not an anti-personnel mine; it was an anti-vehicle mine. Your Lordships may remember that incident or the notices about the subsequent memorial service at St. Columba's, Pont Street.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para137"></a>That brings me to the vague dividing line between anti-vehicle mines and anti-personnel mines, those to which this Bill applies. The anti-tank mine can be fused to be sufficiently sensitive to be detonated by a single pedestrian. It can also easily have a booby-trap attached to it which virtually converts into an anti-personnel mine. I very nearly went up on two occasions on anti-tank mines. I was credited with very good eyesight. Looking over the front of my operational half-track vehicle, I was able to observe, and stopped the driver just in time, the tops of German tellermines just visible ahead.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para138"></a>I also draw attention to Clause 5 which is intended to protect British troops, especially in situations where they are operating with the troops of our allies and other countries which are not party to the convention. Doubt has been expressed again today as to whether the clause has that effect legally and even whether it is consistent with the Ottawa convention. Opinions by eminent lawyers have taken opposite views and I shall not pursue that. But it is an extremely important point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para139"></a>In an allied operation of that kind, the rules of engagement would also be a factor for Britain. Agreeing upon those has proved a very difficult and worrying task in hostilities of recent years for governments of this country and for commanders in the field involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para140"></a>A vital matter of concern, if this Bill is enacted as I hope it will be, is whether in future British troops would be deprived of a weapon which was still possessed by hostile countries with which we might be in conflict. Anyone who has commanded troops in action in war, especially in World War II, would want to protect his <P>


<a name="column_524"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 524</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>soldiers from being placed in such a situation where they were at a disadvantage from the start without a key defensive weapon. I hope the Government can give an assurance in that regard and I realise that the Act will not come into force until the Government choose the day on which it starts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para141"></a>I remind the House that landmines were an essential part of the defence of this country at the time of the Battle of Britain in 1940 and later. Our Scottish Division, which noble Lords may now think was ubiquitous, was defending the beaches in Southern England after Dunkirk and into early 1941. I saw those mines being laid on the beaches, combined with concrete and metal obstacles. We hope that we shall never be in that situation again, but it is worth remembering.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para142"></a>Noble Lords may regard me as an old soldier reminiscing about times past. However, I have spent the past two days taking part in a conference at the new Joint Services Command and Staff College at Bracknell. I have been at the previous annual conferences held by the three separate staff colleges at Camberley. I am invited to speak and answer questions on the major battles of World War II in which I fought. The conference is named "The Realities of War". I took the opportunity this week to hear from senior sapper officers who were there about technological developments in mines. Of course, the Royal Engineers have been the arm of the forces mainly responsible for laying and lifting mines. I am very glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, here. I can tell him from what I have seen at Bracknell that the merging of the three staff colleges seems to be proving very successful. He and I were both in the Commons at the same time and I hope it will not embarrass him if I say that I was glad about his appointment to the Ministry of Defence; I wish him luck; and I feel reassured that he is there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para143"></a>Another reminiscence about mines which I bring in has a happier ending. It also illustrates the adaptability and ingenuity of the British soldier. In the group that I was commanding, I introduced methods of creating dug-outs, trenches and large gun pits by the calculated blowing of holes with high explosives. That replaced laborious digging, especially when the ground was very hard and saved time and lives in getting below ground level quickly. When my soldiers realised how much hard digging was being saved, they soon became experts in explosives and detonating systems. Finding the necessary high explosive was often a problem. However, our sappers, after lifting the enemy's anti-tank mines, tellermines in most cases, would stack them at the roadside and, with their permission, we helped ourselves to them. We then made use of those enemy weapons as explosives for our own benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para144"></a>I hope that noble Lords expected some personal experiences in my speech as I believe that I am the only speaker in this debate old enough to have been in the forces throughout the last world war. We should support the Bill and give it the early passage requested by the Government. It is a first step and may have to be modified later. I shall not be surprised if there is a Landmine (Amendment) Bill in a few years' time. But the Bill is setting an example to the rest of the world. <P>


<a name="column_525"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I hope it will influence those countries which have been exporters of anti-personnel mines, although I fear they may simply regard it as a gesture by the British Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord St. John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, I add my wholehearted support for the Bill, especially after the moving speech of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, with all his personal experiences and expertise on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para145"></a>This is not a time for mentioning the plethora of statistics, but the chilling fact that there are about 60 million landmines scattered around 70 countries which have killed and maimed an estimated 26,000 civilians, half of whom have been women and young children, has certainly highlighted the need for a worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para146"></a>Certainly the scourge of landmines has worsened with the proliferation of civil and tribal wars. The link between landmines and guerilla warfare has turned the landmine from a conventional weapon into an instrument of civilian terror. The Foreign Secretary aptly summarised the situation when, in his Second Reading speech in the other place, he said that after the trauma of war, landmines pollute the peace.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para147"></a>My interest in this subject stems from my having lived most of my life in Southern Africa and having spent a lot of that time in Mozambique and Angola--both countries which have suffered from this extremely serious landmine problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para148"></a>Most of the mines in Mozambique and Angola have been laid without markings or warnings to the civilian population. A large proportion of them have been laid in such a way that their victims are almost guaranteed to be civilians. The full impact of the devastating effects of landmines on civilians, particularly on young children, was vividly displayed when I visited Luanda earlier this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para149"></a>Facilities for the emergency treatment and social rehabilitation of landmine victims in both Angola and Mozambique are totally inadequate and certainly are not improving. Quite apart from the physical suffering caused in these two countries, landmines will certainly continue to present severe obstacles to the much needed economic development and economic recovery of these countries, as well as the implementation of relief programmes and, of course, the return of refugees, a point strongly reinforced by the extremely powerful speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, with all her experience of Africa.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para150"></a>As the Bill stands, there will need to be a number of amendments in order to ensure that the Bill is consistent with the wording of the Ottawa Convention. Several speakers have mentioned--and I do not want to go over powerful points that have already been raised--that the convention makes clear that a state party undertakes never under any circumstances to assist, encourage or induce anyone to engage in any prohibited activity. The United Kingdom Working Group on Landmines sent a brief, which I am sure many of your Lordships will have <P>


<a name="column_526"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>received, which highlighted a number of such inconsistencies and claimed that the current Bill, as drafted, reduces the effect of the prohibition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para151"></a>Despite the assurance of the Minister in her opening speech, I also share the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, regarding Clause 5 on the protection of British troops. I do not, as I have said, want to go over many of the points that have already been raised, but I should like to touch briefly on three issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para152"></a>Concern has been expressed, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, that the definition of landmine contained in the Bill differs from that in the Ottawa Convention. The definition in the Bill appears to be based on the design of the mine and not on its effects. The United Kingdom Working Group on Landmines feels that this Bill should certainly contain a far stronger definition of anti-personnel mines that is closer to the reality of mines.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para153"></a>My second concern is that of jurisdiction. I do not think earlier speakers have mentioned this point. Can the Minister tell the House in which territories the Bill will apply? I ask that because it probably applies to a number of British dependent territories, but not to territories such as Diego Garcia, where United States ships are reported to contain stocks of anti-personnel mines, or to the Falklands.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para154"></a>Finally, could the Minister comment briefly on the transit of prohibited objects, which is also not covered in this Bill? The Ottawa Convention specifically prohibits--and I quote--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"assisting in, or allowing in any way, the transit of anti-personnel mines". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para155"></a>Important though it is to clear landmines, it is equally vital that education programmes should be promoted to increase public awareness of landmines and to give instructions on their clearance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para156"></a>I should like to conclude by joining in congratulating the Government both on introducing the Bill and also on the fact, as the Minister mentioned in her opening speech, that Britain has halved her stockpile of landmines and doubled her contribution to the clearing of landmines throughout the world. I should also like to pay my respects to the sterling work done by the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who succeeded in bringing this problem to the centre stage of public awareness; and also for all the work done by the noble Lord, Lord Deedes, with 40 approvals, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, mentioned--just what he needed to make the Ottawa Convention binding in international law. It is to be hoped that, once Britain has ratified the treaty, this will encourage other countries that signed the convention to follow suit as soon as possible.

<A NAME="80717-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, first I must declare an interest in that I have been an active member of the British Red Cross for more years than I would like to mention. I wanted to contribute to this debate today as we have been discussing in the Red Cross problems of landmines since the beginning of the 1990s. The ICRC became heavily involved as a result of the experiences of its field staff, especially the surgeons who were <P>


<a name="column_527"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 527</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>treating increasing numbers of victims of mines, of whom an appalling proportion were civilians who had no interest or part in the conflict. This produced horrible, painful and often terribly final grief for them and their families.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para157"></a>As the result of an international symposium on landmines which was held in April 1993, and a subsequent public call for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines, the ICRC not only raised public awareness around the world of the growing problem caused by the widespread and feckless use of anti-personnel landmines, but also set out to persuade governments of the urgent need for a total prohibition of these terrible weapons. This was a brave move, as it was considered by some, even of its own members, to be a political move, out of character for the ICRC, which had always prided itself on being a strictly non-political body.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para158"></a>We have heard today from many speakers, especially my noble friend Lady Chalker in her eloquent and moving speech, about these landmines and the horrors that they inflict on innocent citizens. I know, too, what they are talking about as I nursed for several years, and part of my training was at the Roehampton Artificial Limb Centre. There can be no question that the indiscriminate laying of non-self-destructing or non-self-neutralising anti-personnel mines should be totally banned. They are probably one of the nastiest weapons invented. That said, to quote the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, responding to a question during the Strategic Defence Review Statement:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is the policy of Her Majesty's Government to work towards a nuclear-free world".--[Official Report, 8/7/98; col. 1277]. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para159"></a>He hoped, too, for a world which had no bombs, bayonets or machine guns. He might even have said bows and arrows. In the best of all possible worlds, of course we would agree with him. Weapons are horrible, war is horrible; but, unfortunately, we live in a world which, alas, is not always peaceful and beautiful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para160"></a>Even the United States, a non-signatory to the treaty, announced at the end of June that it was to detonate about 80 non-self-destructing landmines as part of ceremonies commemorating the final destruction of the US stockpile of more than 3.3 million non-self-destructing landmines. Moreover, along with the People's Republic of China, the Americans reaffirmed their commitment to ending the human suffering caused by the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel mines. Neither of these two countries has signed the Ottawa Treaty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para161"></a>There has been a series of international treaties regarding the banning of different types of weapons, the use of which had come to affront the conscience of mankind--from poison gas to napalm to dumdum bullets. I shall not recite here today the long, long list. We are discussing the Ottawa Treaty which was signed by the Government in 1977 but which has yet to be ratified by the UK. The treaty is now obviously causing the Government some problems. We have yet to discover whether those problems are moral or legal. However, there is obviously enough in the treaty to trouble them in that we have in the Bill today Clause 5 which does not fall in line with the treaty, especially Article 19.
<P>


<a name="column_528"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 528</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para162"></a>I have just a few simple questions for the Minister. First, will this Bill, attached to the treaty, stand up in international law? Secondly, how will our forces co-operate in manoeuvres with those of our NATO allies whose governments are not party to the convention? Thirdly, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, how have the French and the Germans, who have signed the treaty, dealt with this problem?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para163"></a>Finally, is it not the case that the real reason that we have this treaty is that so many states have, with almost frivolous irresponsibility, failed to observe the requirements of those most important previous treaties concerning landmines; namely, the Geneva Convention and the inhumane weapons convention? Both drew a clear distinction between the indiscriminate laying of non-self destructing anti-personnel mines and the use of "smart" anti-personnel mines directed at military targets which are properly marked or mapped. I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy for pointing out the difference so clearly today. Some say that banning the latter removes a vital defensive system without which soldiers lives are placed at risk. They add that there is a difference between laying mines in times of war for sound tactical reasons, as opposed to indiscriminate mining which is so abhorrent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para164"></a>I should be grateful to the Minister if she could provide answers to my questions, but I should like to assure her that, like my noble friend Lord Moynihan, I support the spirit of the Bill and look forward to going into further detail during the Committee stage next week.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, and other noble Lords who have spoken, I am very pleased that the Government have managed to squeeze this Bill in before the Recess. As a doctor, it might be expected that I should describe the graphic details of the effects of anti-personnel landmines, but noble Lords will be pleased to hear that I shall desist!
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para165"></a>The preamble to the convention itself summarises quite effectively the reasons why it is necessary, as well as describing the previous protocols and United Nations declarations, referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, which preceded it and led to its adoption and opening for signature last December.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para166"></a>It has been a very long campaign led, to a large degree, by many non-governmental organisations concerned with international development and human rights. In this country, I personally would single out the Mines Advisory Group from Cockermouth as doing especially good work. The UK Working Group on Landmines lists, at the foot of its notepaper, 55 British NGOs which have been involved in the landmines issue, and there are hundreds more worldwide. Princess Diana was actually quite late on the scene but no less important, because her involvement meant that the whole world became aware of the problem. Her stance was courageous (as it had previously been with AIDS victims) but, at the time, it certainly displeased some Members of the party diagonally opposite to me.
<P>


<a name="column_529"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para167"></a>If names are to be mentioned, I think that my noble friend Lord Puttnam should not be forgotten. He was a pioneer in raising awareness dramatically and movingly when, in "The Killing Fields" set in Cambodia, the recently orphaned small boy being carried to safety was killed by an anti-personnel landmine while, incidentally, acting as a shield and saving the life of his rescuer Dith Pran, the main character in the film.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para168"></a>Quite apart from the direct impact of anti-personnel landmines on non-combatants, especially children, several noble Lords have pointed out the important indirect effect that they have on food production by making large tracks of potentially useful agricultural land into no-go areas, so increasing the need for food aid and inhibiting the return of refugees, thus putting back development for years after the conflict itself has ended.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para169"></a>Before discussing the Bill itself, perhaps my noble friend the Minister could give the House some idea of the proportion of countries which have signed the Ottawa Convention likely to ratify it? There are 126 countries on the list, as printed in Article 22 of the convention. Can my noble friend say how many more have signed since December 1997, and how many countries have ratified? Further, do we know how many more have actually announced their intention to do so?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para170"></a>We know that three major powers--Russia, China and the United States--will not sign and ratify it at present; though, as we have heard, the USA will do so but only by the year 2006. Unfortunately, most of the countries in which conflict is currently in progress, or where there is considerable international tension, are not among the signatories. In fact, 11 countries in the Middle East, 13 out of 15 countries of the former Soviet Union, 12 countries in Africa, 12 in Asia and just two in the Americas have not signed. Their populations together total more than half the population of the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para171"></a>I suggest that those countries would be much more likely to sign or ratify the convention if the potential conflicts both inter and intra-state, which are troubling them, could be settled. It is very gratifying to know that Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Uganda, Croatia and Bosnia, which were recently in severe conflict situations and where landmines had a terrible impact, are now at peace and among the signatories. Thus, I suggest that the United Nations has a further incentive to strengthen its role in conflict resolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para172"></a>A large part of the debate in another place last week--as well as this afternoon--concerned Clause 5. My noble friend has explained why the Government think that it is necessary. As my noble friend Lord Kennet has mentioned, the Canadian Government have entered a declaration of understanding in the convention for the same purpose. Like my noble friend, I prefer their wording to the wording in the Bill. Their parliamentary Bill--passed by the Canadian House of Commons--permitting ratification, includes the following phrase with regard to participation in joint military exercises with a non-signatory state,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that participation is not prohibited if [it] does not amount to active assistance in that prohibited activity". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_530"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para173"></a>The words "active assistance" will cover a wider area than Clause 5(b), which disallows only the actual laying of anti-personnel mines. However, I am quite sure that all this will be discussed at length next week during the Committee and Report stages (if we have a Report stage). At this juncture it is worth reminding my noble friend that, if the Government introduce an agreed amendment, they will still have a week in which to send it back to another place where it can be speedily agreed if there is all-party support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para174"></a>Finally, I should like to comment on humanitarian de-mining. I realise that the Bill itself is not the place where this should be discussed, although the destruction of stockpiles and rules for fact-finding missions, for example, are covered. The convention contains two important articles, Article 5 on the destruction of anti-personnel mines in mined areas, and Article 6 on international co-operation and assistance. I know that the Government have played a major part in training--both the previous government and this Government even more so--and have devoted some &#163;20 million to the task of de-mining. Can my noble friend outline future plans? I gather that some other countries have spent even more than we have, particularly in relation to their GDP. It is money well spent. If properly done, whole areas of agricultural land are opened up again, helping to achieve food sufficiency in poor countries, and even, potentially, exports of rice for example, so that funds now used for food and other humanitarian relief can be diverted to their proper purpose of supporting development projects which, if properly targeted, will help to lift people out of poverty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para175"></a>I commend the Bill to the House. It may well be possible to improve it, but I believe it allows us to ratify the convention as it stands. Any doubts about its effectiveness for that purpose can be examined in detail in Committee.

<A NAME="80717-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to your Lordships and to the House for speaking in the gap but I had a longstanding appointment this morning which prevented me yesterday from putting my name down to speak. As a result I regret I have heard only about half of your Lordships' debate, but I would like to make three points.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para176"></a>First, as a recent serving soldier I am well aware of the horrific effects of anti-personnel mines and the appalling damage and lifelong suffering which they cause. However, in war in a defensive position where there may not be sufficient military units on the ground and where there are large areas that have to be denied to the enemy, these anti-personnel marked minefields are a defensive protection. Without them the lives of our soldiers are more at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para177"></a>Secondly, I believe the laying of marked and recorded anti-personnel conventional minefields in accordance with the Geneva conventions in times of real warfare such as World War II and the Gulf should have been retained until we have a new weapon system to replace them. Unlike indiscriminate and horrific anti-personnel minefields laid in guerrilla, tribal, civil and terrorist <P>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 531</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wars, and in the former Yugoslavia, these marked and recorded minefields can be cleared without the difficulties encountered with indiscriminate minefields laid by rebel forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para178"></a>Thirdly, some piece of legislation along the lines of Clause 5--I apologise to your Lordships for not hearing the arguments on both sides concerning Clause 5--is essential to this Bill if our servicemen and women are to be protected from facing a possible 14-year penal sentence. It will enable our Armed Forces to take part in exercises and operations involving anti-personnel mine measures with allies such as the United States of America, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, who are not signatories to the treaty. Under these circumstances it would allow them to become involved in the planning, procuring, transporting, using and handling of anti-personnel mines, but not the action of laying them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para179"></a>Without some clause to protect our Armed Forces the fighting spirit and morale of the Army and our Armed Forces could diminish. One day we may not win a future war because we have denied our Armed Forces the appropriate weapons to defend themselves in battle. Mines are cheap to manufacture and in my opinion it will never be possible to prevent all countries making mines. I expect they will be present on the battlefield for the foreseeable future. Some provision in the Bill is essential to protect our Armed Forces on the field of battle when operating with nations who have not signed the Ottawa convention.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, the noble and gallant Lord has struck the one note of discord with regard to keeping anti-personnel landmines. I believe there is a great deal of consensus around the rest of the House that these weapons must be got rid of.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para180"></a>Many people who have been involved in this campaign have been mentioned. I wish to pay tribute to those noble Lords who over the years have taken part in many debates on landmines. I was hoping that the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, would be in her place at this point because on at least three occasions I have debated with her the question of landmines. I also wish to mention many of the NGOs, such as the mines advisory group which has worked hard on the convention. There are also groups which are involved not so much with words but with the deeds of removing anti-personnel landmines, such as the Halo Trust, which has already been mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para181"></a>It should not be forgotten that this treaty is not at odds with the mood in the country. A number of campaigns have been run in national papers such as the Sun and the Express. I believe that public opinion has been a contributory factor in giving the Government the necessary impetus to implement the treaty as quickly as possible. I congratulate the Government on bringing forward this legislation at the present time. It would be extremely unfortunate if we did not have this legislation at a time when so many countries are in the process of ratifying the treaty. I believe that over 30 countries will have ratified the measure. We shall be one of the 40 countries that are needed to bring about the convention's implementation.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para182"></a>Over the past year the Government have shown they are prepared to take a lead on the issue of landmines. Their destruction of half the stockpile of British landmines is an extremely valuable example of that. That has a cost implication. It has already cost &#163;5 million to undertake that destruction. The Government have provided an extra &#163;5 million, taking to &#163;10 million the amount spent on landmine clearances. Although that is a drop in the ocean compared to the number of landmines that have been laid, it is an extremely valuable contribution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para183"></a>My experience of landmines was during the period when I was monitoring elections in Mozambique. I had the unfortunate experience of driving a truck 10 miles down a 20-kilometre road only to discover that the road was not the one that the guide had thought but was a mined road. I am not a brave person by any means, and I experienced a quivering of the stomach. However, I gained a knowledge of the feeling that landmines produce in people. They have horrific consequences. Between two polling stations we counted 35 people walking to the stations who had only one limb.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para184"></a>But the consequences of landmines go further. Being terrified when driving along a road is one experience; but there are places where people will walk only along beaten paths, and will not enter fields used for cultivation; they will not step one millimetre off the path because of the very real risk of stepping on a landmine. The fear of landmines is real to everyone who lives in a mined region.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para185"></a>I wish to concentrate on the detail of the ratification of the convention. I speak as a serving officer in the Territorial Army. I wish particularly to examine Clause 5. There are major problems with the clause, though I also understand the reasons why the Government included it. It contains a necessary defence of service personnel. Nevertheless, the clause has rather worrying aspects.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para186"></a>Clause 5 has to be seen in the light of the reason for its original inclusion in the Bill. It was as a result of the Americans citing their use of landmines as a barrier against North Korea. We should be aware of the debate that is going on between the American military and the American Government over the need to retain landmines as a weapon of war. I base my comment on a statement made by General Clark, the US Army Commander in Chief, United States European Command, before a committee of the House of Representatives in March this year. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The requirement for such a capability is increasing in light of evolving and future operational concepts that envisage our forces conducting dispersed operations over expanded battlespace. We must work deliberately and discreetly with our Allies to ensure that we can execute our NATO warfighting plans, as well as our unilateral missions, once the Ottawa APL agreement comes into force". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para187"></a>There is a feeling among the American military that they will still be using landmines for some considerable time to come.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para188"></a>My difficulty with Clause 5 is that it is extremely wide in its application. I am not a lawyer. I merely put forward questions for clarification from the Minister. It is stated that under Clause 5 the Secretary of State shall <P>


<a name="column_533"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 533</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>issue a certificate when operations which might include landmines are to be conducted. When would such a certificate be issued? The former position held by the Government was that they would use landmines in exceptional circumstances, and that their use would be covered by an issued certificate. However, if an operation is to take place and if there is to be a defence of personnel in relation to the use of landmines, the certificate would have to be issued prior to the operation. In addition, while a certificate was authorised, Clause 5 would allow troops to do everything but lay the mines. The penalties under Clause 2 would be covered by the provisions of Clause 5. Also, I understand that military personnel could face a court martial. I do not see how that could happen if a certificate had been issued.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para189"></a>As drafted, Clause 5 could be seen as contrary to Article 19 of the convention, which would be seen as a reservation. I must admit after hearing the debate in another place last Friday that there was a degree of unease associated with the remarks of the Armed Forces Minister. He stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The clause enables United Kingdom service men and women to engage closely in the planning and conduct of an operation with those who may, lawfully for them, use anti-personnel mines".--[Official Report, Commons, 10/7/98; col. 1391.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para190"></a>It is not my intention to cast aspersions and suggest that the Government's intention is anything other than to stick to the strict principles of the Ottawa convention. However, Clause 5, as drafted could allow a soldier to undertake the planning of an operation, the transportation of landmines, the positioning of the landmines, and even have soldiers prime the landmines so long as troops from a non-ratifying state were those who had actually laid the mines. That would be rather strange. We have talked about the loophole: the example given was of a truck being driven over a bridge built by a sapper. That loophole is wide enough in itself for a truck to be driven through it!
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-02_para191"></a>I understand that the second half of the check and balance on British service personnel taking any part in such operations would be under the rules of engagement. That presents a problem. I am not sure that it can be said that the Ottawa convention has been ratified until the rules of engagement have been published. I shall accept advice; however, I believe that if the rules of engagement are published--normally they are not--how can the Government say that in Clause 5 they are sticking to the principle of the Ottawa convention? Perhaps in this case the rules of engagement can be published and made available and, unlike other rules of engagement, be set in such a way that they cannot be changed from one operation to another--<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80717-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kennet: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will allow me to intervene. Does he agree that the solution to that problem might be a wider use of the Privy Counsellor system whereby the leadership of the Opposition parties is taken into the confidence of the <P>


<a name="column_534"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 534</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government in relation to militarily secret matters, and is then able to give general assurances to its rank and file?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, that would be one solution. However, when we are ratifying such an important treaty, whose main aim is to guide others into signing it in order to bring about a universal ban on landmines, should we talk about secrecy? Matters should be out in the open. Perhaps the rules of engagement should be published openly. Without such publication, there is a major problem with other states seeing our ratification of the convention as being in the spirit of the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para0"></a>Has representation been made to the British Government by any other countries concerning Clause 5? I understand that Australia and Canada have shown some disapproval of the clause. Will the Minister publish those representations and place them in the Library, or at least make the House aware of them?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para1"></a>It would be wrong to say that we believe that Clause 5 is a reason for preventing this legislation going through. I merely wish to make the Government aware of the problems I have mentioned. I do not believe that they have any intention but to follow the clear principles set out in the Ottawa convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para2"></a>However, one unfortunate point was that in the debates in another place there seemed to be a total neglect of one of the principles set out in the preamble, which is universalisation. That is one of those ugly words, but in this context it is extremely important. No ratification of the Ottawa convention will mean much if the major producers of anti-personnel mines do not ratify the convention. It is those countries that we must get on board.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para3"></a>It is my hope that, through ratifying the convention and through the body of support behind it, if the Government will take a lead, one day the anti-personnel mines will be seen with the abhorrence that chemical and biological weapons are now seen.

<A NAME="80717-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, this is not one of those Bills which will require the Lord Privy Seal to remind your Lordships that in certain circumstances there is something called the Salisbury convention. It is a Bill which has attracted, it seems, almost universal support. I can assure the Minister that we are here to help; that is our sole object.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para4"></a>Noble Lords are united in support of what has been an impressive debate which has avoided, I believe I  am  right in saying, a certain amount of the incomprehensible nastiness which arose in the debate in another place. But speeches in your Lordships' House today fall into two types: first, those from noble Lords like my noble friends Lord Campbell and Lady Chalker based on personal experience of the horrors of the anti-personnel landmine; and others who have taken a practical approach to the solution of the undoubled difficulties in the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_535"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 535</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord Moynihan provided a comprehensive study of all matters concerned with the Bill, and anything that he did not say has been said by other noble Lords. It is therefore possible for me to be relatively brief. I am deeply sorry that we have not had the opportunity of hearing my noble friend Lord Deedes, who has done more than anyone else to help with the problem. I have sat at his feet for 40 years, in the early days literally, and I wish we could have heard him today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para6"></a>The Bill is not easy; it presents many problems. That was accepted in the other place by the honourable Member, Mr. Menzies Campbell, who said that the Government had better get their tin hats on before they faced the "legion of lawyers" in your Lordships' House. If I were the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, or one of her officials, I would be extremely gloomy about the amount of work I had to put in before next Friday in order to anticipate some of the amendments that will be raised and answer the enormous number of questions which have been raised during the course of the debate today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para7"></a>The Bill looks a little as though it had been put together at speed without too much thought. Its aims are desirable, of course, but there was not too much thought on the detail. What is an anti-personnel landmine, and how do you protect the interests of the British serviceman who may be working alongside an American on a NATO exercise? Clause 5 is undoubtedly designed to provide British servicemen with a shield against unreasonable prosecution as a result of working with representatives of other countries who have not signed the Ottawa convention. Whether the clause will effectively do so will no doubt be tested during the debate next week. It is probably true to say that in such circumstances our servicemen are expected to keep operations including landmines at arm's length, but how long is your arm? I apologise, but I cannot resist picking up a remark from the noble Baroness during the course of her opening speech. She said that we must not expect servicemen to risk their liberty for carrying out their duty. That is exactly what this Government and the previous government have been doing in certain cases which have come to your Lordships' notice recently.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para8"></a>Clause 5 permits a wide range of activity, in fact everything, it would seem, except actually laying a landmine. That will need to be explained. The terms of the Bill, as several noble Lords pointed out, are not in accordance with the wording of the convention and there are many inconsistencies that will have to be explored. Some aspects of the Bill seem to resemble the old but important question of how many angels can be fitted on the point of a pin. British personnel would seem to be allowed to be involved in planning an operation provided they do not carry it out themselves. Perhaps they will keep coolies for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para9"></a>When the United States of America, Russia and China, among other countries, sign the convention the situation will be very much easier. At present there are 24 signatories and, as we know, the convention becomes valid at 40. But which 40? It is important that those countries which might be thought likely to use anti-personnel landmines should be among those who <P>


<a name="column_536"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have signed the convention. Until they do, the effectiveness of the Bill and of the convention itself will be very much in doubt.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para10"></a>Numbers and types of landmines also present difficulties. Explanations will be required as to which types fall inside or outside the convention and the terms of the Bill. I cannot resist the remark that such considerations are easier to debate and to consider within your Lordships' House than in the field. The Mines Advisory Group names six varieties of scatterable mines used by the Americans alone. They may or may not contain anti-handling devices which turn them from legitimate anti-tank mines into indiscriminating anti-personnel mines. To what extent does the fitting of an anti-handling device bring the weapon into proscription under the terms of the Bill? Drawing the line between the different devices is extremely difficult, not least because of the problems of definition. Not unnaturally the Ministry of Defence considers details of the fusing mechanism to be classified information and will not release it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para11"></a>I am sorry that we have not had the opportunity of hearing the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, although I am grateful to him for being in his place throughout the debate. There is undoubtedly the question of how far the defence requirements of this country are damaged by banning anti-personnel landmines. My noble friend Lord Vivian touched on that point. With respect to him, the Bill is an emotional question and not a strategic defence question, but there are problems which I should have liked answered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para12"></a>The different kinds of weapon will be covered in Committee, such as the Claymore mine. If it is fired by trip wire it is banned by the Ottawa convention, if by command wire it is not. It is not that difficult to change the system between one and the other. Soldiers in the field may well feel, when they get there, that the preservation of their lives by the use of anti-personnel mines, by converting a non-anti-personnel mine into an anti-personnel mine, may outweigh the importance of the chance of prosecution under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para13"></a>Anti-tank mines are excluded and considered to be legitimate weapons. The British Shielder weapon comes into that category. Much work remains to be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para14"></a>We have two problems in the Bill: the definition of mines and Clause 5. There is a third problem, which is the destruction of landmines. That is a very important point. However, I would like to say to the Minister that obviously we entirely support the Bill. If there is any help, advice or constructive criticism or answers to constructive criticism which arise between now and next week, we will be only too delighted to do everything we can to assist the proper progress and completion of the Bill.

<A NAME="80717-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, we have had an excellent Second Reading debate and I noted the various comments made by noble Lords about the Ottawa convention and this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para15"></a>It is clear that, in general, the Bill has the support of noble Lords from all sides. Some spoke with direct experience of landmines, as did the noble Lord, Lord <P>


<a name="column_537"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 537</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Campbell of Croy, and others as witnesses, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker. But the spirit in which we have had the debate has seen your Lordships' House at its best.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para16"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, is correct in saying that my noble friend and I will have to look carefully at the points raised. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, that, although he was deprived of the wisdom of my noble friend Lord Gilbert today, he will have it in full measure next week. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, for reminding me that I too should declare my membership of the Red Cross, and I do so now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para17"></a>My noble friend Lord Rea asked about the numbers involved. Let me reiterate that 122 countries signed the convention when it opened for signature in December last year; the figure is now 128. Of those countries, 24 have to date ratified the convention and several more have indicated that they will do so soon. However, I cannot give my noble friend an exact figure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para18"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Vivian, raised some points not raised by other noble Lords. The Government accept that the worldwide elimination of anti-personnel mines will have some consequences for British military capability. However, the Government's view is that the limited utility of anti-personnel mines is far outweighed by the suffering they cause.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para19"></a>Perhaps I can clear up another point. I thought, though I may have been wrong, that the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, indicated that the United States did not intend to sign the Ottawa convention. Although the United States has not signed, it announced that it is actively exploring ways to deal with anti-personnel landmines with a view to being able to sign the convention in the year 2006. The noble Lord is right that the historical producers and exporters of anti-personnel mines--for example, China, India and Russia--have also not signed the convention. They argue the need for them to defend their borders. But Her Majesty's Government will continue to urge as many countries as possible to sign and ratify the convention while pursuing the wider ban in other fora, including the conference on disarmament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para20"></a>In relation to the conference on disarmament, a special co-ordinator has been appointed to gather members' views on how best to take forward work on landmines and it is due to report shortly. We hope that early agreement can be reached on the establishment of a committee to work on landmines, perhaps beginning with a ban on transfers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and one or two other noble Lords, raised the question of de-mining the Falkland Islands. The Ottawa convention requires us to de-mine all areas under our jurisdiction and control within 10 years, unless we can show good reason why we cannot. Those reasons may include humanitarian, environmental, financial or technical considerations. Those are important points to remember. We are looking carefully at that question and intend to carry out a study into the feasibility and cost of de-mining the islands and are currently considering the best way to take that forward.
<P>


<a name="column_538"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 538</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para22"></a>The noble Lord also raised questions in relation to booby-traps. The Bill prohibits the use of any weapons classified as anti-personnel mines under the Ottawa convention. An improvised mine placed in or near the ground and detonated by the presence of an individual, whether by pressure, trip wire or other methods, would therefore be covered. Several noble Lords raised that point and I hope that the definitions are helpful. The wider category of booby-traps which have different characteristics from those of anti-personnel mines and are used for different purposes was deliberately not addressed by the Ottawa convention, which focused solely on anti-personnel mines. Use of booby-traps by British forces is constrained by the restriction set out in amended Protocol 2 of the UN Weaponry Convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, also asked about costs. I do not want to detain the House too long, but while I can answer some of these points it may be helpful to do so in preparation for next week. Four main categories of cost arise from the convention. There are the administrative costs which will fall to the SCO. They relate to the UK contribution to the costs of meetings of state parties and UK delegations attending such meetings. Such costs are not expected to exceed &#163;75,000 over the next five years. The immediate implementation costs of the convention are &#163;5 million for the destruction of UK anti-personnel landmines--I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, in this regard--which fall to the MoD. As has been noted, we are nearly halfway through that programme of destruction already.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para24"></a>The costs of the MoD filling the capability gap for our Armed Forces in the longer term are still under study and depend on the outcome of operational analysis. Lastly, long-term mine clearance costs could also arise in the Falkland Islands, as I have already indicated. There may also be some costs which arise from the need to review certain support contracts and those will depend on commercial negotiations. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, mentioned the JP233 service contract, which would fall into just that sort of category.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, also asked about other states' anti-personnel mines stored in the UK. There are none, nor will there be any in the future. However, a rather different point was raised by the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, in relation to United Kingdom overseas territories. We made clear out commitment to the Ottawa convention and our allies--I believe the noble Lord was thinking particularly of the United States--are well aware of that. The United States knows that we hope that it will sign and ratify the convention as quickly as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para26"></a>The Bill applies outside the UK only in respect of UK nationals, Scottish partnerships and bodies incorporated under the law of the UK. There is a power in Clause 29(4) to extend that by means of an Order in Council to our overseas territories and we shall be consulting with the territories and proceeding with the extension as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para27"></a>A number of noble Lords asked about definitions. I hope I have dealt with the specific question about booby-traps. Perhaps I may go on to the questions raised <P>


<a name="column_539"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford. Several noble Lords asked about the Shielder weapon. The Shielder mine system is an anti-tank weapon and therefore is not against the spirit of the Ottawa convention. The convention did not and never was intended to address anti-tank mines. It is internationally recognised that, unlike anti-personnel mines, anti-tank mines do not pose a serious humanitarian threat. Of course they are very dangerous weapons, but they do not pose the same humanitarian threat. It is accepted internationally, and the Ottawa convention makes it clear, that anti-tank mines are not covered by the ban.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para28"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnham, asked about other mines. The HB876 and the M181A Claymore are classified as anti-personnel mines and are therefore banned by the convention, in what I understand is called the victim initiated mode. Those are horrible words, my Lords, but that is the definition. The UK does not have and will not acquire the Gator mine system. It is not part of the Shielder system, which I have just described. The A2 is an anti-tank mine. The PJRAD Claymore-type mine is command detonated and is not therefore covered by the Ottawa Convention. That is also true of the M181A Claymore in command-detonated mode. I hope that that has given your Lordships extra and helpful information on those points. On a rather different point, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, that as far as we are aware--as he was speaking I checked with my officials--every minefield with which the United Kingdom has been involved since the war, whether anti-personnel or anti-tank, has been accurately recorded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para29"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, asked what we are doing to speed up mine clearance. The UK is supporting efforts to improve de-mining techniques. Ways to do things more cheaply, more safely and indeed more quickly need to be developed and we are looking at technology which will be appropriate in that respect. My colleagues in the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence are looking at new initiatives ranging from sophisticated multi-sensors to very simple clearance tools. Research is going on in British universities. We are currently supporting a project at Warwick University's development technology unit to develop equipment that will speed up mine clearance activities. The equipment is now ready to undergo trials overseas. I hope that that answers some of the points quite rightly raised by the noble Baroness about our research effort in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para30"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, asked a number of questions about consistency between the convention and the legislation. He is quite right. Some of the language used in the definitions and in the Bill is different from the definitions used in the convention. We have sought greater clarity where appropriate but without changing the substance of the definitions. We believe that, if anything, the language in the Bill is tighter than that used in the convention. For example, the Bill covers components which the convention does not.

<A NAME = "80717-03_para31"></a>It is the Government's view that our legislation is in accordance with the aims and conventions of the Ottawa Convention. The kinds of things that have been described as possible abuses of the convention, because of the protection afforded by Clause 5, are not in the Government's view a correct understanding of the legislation before your Lordships. The legislation faithfully and fully puts the Ottawa convention into British legislation. Let me repeat this to your Lordships. It prohibits from using, developing, producing, possessing or transferring anti-personnel landmines or assisting, encouraging or inducing anyone else to do so. That provision will be clearly expressed in the rules of engagement for British troops, a very important point which the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, mentioned and one to which I shall come in a moment or two.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para32"></a>The fact is that Clause 5 simply recognises the reality of the situations in which our forces may find themselves. It does not allow UK personnel to use anti-personnel mines; nor does it allow them to assist, encourage or induce anyone else to do so. My noble friend Lord Kennet used the example that was used by my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in another place last week of the sapper, and he seemed to be a little sceptical about that example. I shall give him a second example. Perhaps it is a rather more dramatic example but it is an example of why we need the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para33"></a>In a combined operation British troops may find themselves operating alongside United States forces who are laying mines to protect themselves. If the latter were then to come under enemy fire it is unthinkable for British troops not to defend them, but clearly, that would not be deliberate assistance in laying mines. In those circumstances British troops should not be punished for it. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, said that that was all very well, but why not publish the rules of engagement? To do that would put our troops at risk. The rules of engagement are set for individual situations and within the general context. I have assured your Lordships what that will be in this respect. We never have published--nor do I believe that any government ever would publish--the rules of engagement for British forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para34"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the use of the certificate. It is a way of proving who participated in an operation. It is not a condition of the defence, which is what the noble Lord seemed to imply. The certificate would only be issued when the question of who participated in the operation arose during the course of criminal proceedings. I hope that that helps the noble Lord on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para35"></a>Several noble Lords have asked: if we are to have Clause 5, why do not other countries have it? One noble Lord suggested that some countries had gone so far as to protest to the United Kingdom. I believe it was the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, who said that there had been Canadian or Australian disapproval on that point. I can assure noble Lords that no such disapproval has been expressed to Her Majesty's Government. However, we spent some time discussing the Canadian interpretive statement on ratification. The noble Lord, Lord Kennet, was good enough to detail that statement to your Lordships. It should also be remembered that Austria, <P>


<a name="column_541"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 541</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which drafted the convention, has informed us that it interprets the convention in the same way as the Canadians.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para36"></a>The question then arose as to why there could not be a similar declaration in respect of the United Kingdom. The Government take the view that the mere incorporation of a declaration along the lines of the Canadian declaration, simply would not give British troops the unequivocal protection they need when participating in the conduct and planning of operations with countries not bound by the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para37"></a>The spirit of Clause 5 is very close to the declaration, but the clause takes a form appropriate to our domestic law. It takes account of the complications of that law such as the potential liability for a conspiracy or aiding or abetting.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para38"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary in another place last week made it very clear that the law officers concurred with the points made in Clause 5. My right honourable and learned friend the Attorney- General explicitly made his own position clear last week. He agreed entirely with what my right honourable friend said on this point. I and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, may not be lawyers, but very learned lawyers indeed have been able to give us the benefit of their advice on this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para39"></a>Perhaps I may cover the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, on the use of mines for training. The Bill does not set out how many mines may be retained for training purposes in de-mining. It allows the minimum number necessary to be retained. The convention allows them to be retained for training, detection and clearance purposes and also destruction. The Bill does no more than reproduce that position in the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para40"></a>My noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester asked about mine victims. We have contributed to the international assistance for victims of landmines through our support of the ICRC, the World Health Organisation and non-governmental organisations. Last year we contributed &#163;1.15 million to the ICRC for programmes to assist these victims.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para41"></a>Much of what we have discussed has been about NATO inter-operability. As I have said, the United States has said that it hopes to sign the convention in the year 2006. But it is not just about operating alongside the Americans. Without Clause 5 our troops could not operate alongside forces belonging to states which are not bound by the convention. In NATO that includes Turkey. Elsewhere it might include Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait. I am sure that noble Lords are not really suggesting that any state, which is not a signatory of the Ottawa convention, thereby forfeits any expectation of assistance from allies or friends were such a state to be invaded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para42"></a>I think that I have covered all the main points, so I turn finally to de-mining. The United Kingdom has an extremely good record in terms of assistance to the global humanitarian de-mining action. We are one of the world's leading bilateral donors. The DfID is doubling expenditure on de-mining activities and the FCO has <P>


<a name="column_542"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 542</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contributed over &#163;450,000 to the United Nations to assist the co-ordination of global humanitarian de-mining.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para43"></a>Many noble Lords have singled out those whose contributions to bringing us to the point of this legislation have been quite outstanding. I should like to pay one further tribute, to Mr. Christopher Howes, a brave British man who was involved in de-mining work in Cambodia. He was kidnapped and he lost his life by doing that valuable, selfless, difficult and dangerous work. His is not a famous name; it is not really well known, but he was one of the true heroes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-03_para44"></a>We should all remember the wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, with all his experience and expertise, when he said that what we need now is to set a good example. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para0"></a>I am very glad to be able to commend this Bill to your Lordships' House. The proper regulation of London minicabs is an issue in which I myself have long taken an interest--to the extent of seeking to promote a Private Member's Bill some years ago. I know that my concern is shared by many noble Lords who believe that the complete absence of regulation in the London minicab trade is a serious anomaly which should be remedied as a matter of public safety.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para1"></a>The Bill seeks to provide such a remedy. It was introduced in another place many months ago by Sir George Young. I believe great credit is due to him for his patient determination that the Bill should progress. The Bill had an unopposed Second Reading in the other place, and hopes were high for its success. It then ran into the particular problems which this Session have beset Private Members' Bills. I would remind your Lordships of the short debate which we had in this House on 13th May, when we feared that the Bill was lost. More recently, I am delighted to say, it has come back to life, with the result that we can debate it today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para2"></a>It follows that we are in a different procedural position from what we once expected. It had previously been thought that even if the Bill had made progress in the other place, it would have been without any very detailed examination. In fact, the Bill has had a substantive Committee stage in the other place. After Committee stage, I am glad to say, the Member who had blocked progress of the Bill withdrew his opposition. Many amendments were extensively debated in Committee. This means that important issues have been explored and explained, and the Minister has been involved and has helped in this process. A number of amendments were actually made to the Bill--some technical but others more significant--in response to representations and suggestions from interested parties. As a result, I believe that the Bill before your <P>


<a name="column_543"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships' House is improved, and I hope very much that your Lordships will feel able to send it on its way to Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para3"></a>I would like to acknowledge the many organisations that have supported this Bill. As your Lordships know, the Bill has a wide range of support; this was clear in our debate on 13th May. I would like to thank those who have given their support, especially the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which has worked so hard to help its progress. The Consumers Association has done a lot for the Bill, as also have RADAR, Age Concern and the Royal National Institute for the Blind. When the Government went out to consultation last year, very broad support was expressed from organisations such as the National Council of Women of Great Britain, the British Tourist Authority and the Greater London Association for Disabled People.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para4"></a>A special word about the trade associations is appropriate. The London Private Hire Car Association has been constructive throughout. It is rightly keen to have its trade properly regulated to support the majority of operators who do a good and safe job and make life difficult for the minority who do not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para5"></a>The London Taxi Board on behalf of the black cab trade, has given the Bill support. I think that it deserves praise for such a responsible approach, especially as not very long ago its attitude was much more ambivalent. I crossed swords with that body 10 years ago. When I was first involved over 10 years ago I felt that it did not appreciate the benefits which regulation would bring. I believe that now it sees much more clearly the merits of the case and the advantages to the taxi trade of having these new controls and enforcement measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para6"></a>I hope I have shown that the Bill has widespread support. One can see why. In London taxis have long been regulated by the Public Carriage Office. Outside London both taxis and minicabs are almost universally regulated by local authorities. That means that there are proper checks on vehicles to make sure they are safe to do the high mileage that is expected of taxis and minicabs. There are checks on minicab operators to make sure that they are proper people to run such a business and there are checks on drivers. Above all, drivers are subject to a criminal record check to protect the travelling public from people with convictions for violence or sexual offences. Let us never forget that many passengers will be vulnerable. The young, the old and people being driven alone late at night have all been at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para7"></a>In England and Wales there has been regulation since 1976. The large, glaring exception is the London minicab trade. Here by an anomaly of legislative history there is no regulation at all. It is often pointed out in discussion of this issue that in the morning a man may leave prison after serving a sentence for rape and by evening may quite legally be driving young women home in a London minicab. That illustrates so well the scale of the anomaly and the risk that we face in London. Legislation as a simple matter of public safety is long overdue. At last this Bill gives us a chance to put things right.
<P>


<a name="column_544"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 544</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para8"></a>In essence the Bill is simple. It aims to introduce for London a system of regulation on the same principles as those that apply to the minicab trade elsewhere. It therefore provides for the licensing of minicab operators, minicab drivers and the vehicles themselves. It sets out the broad criteria which must be met for the grant of each licence, and it provides for changes to be made in respect of those licences. As to who will carry out the licensing and regulatory function, noble Lords will see that the Bill is drafted in terms of the Secretary of State. But Ministers have made it clear that that function will be delegated, as provided for in Clause 24 of the Bill, to the Metropolitan Police so that the work is done by the Public Carriage Office--that branch of the Metropolitan Police which already regulates London taxis. I believe that that makes a lot of sense. The PCO already has the expertise, geographical coverage and accommodation. The London black cab trade is respected worldwide and that is due in no small measure to the firm but fair way in which the PCO goes about its regulatory task. If sometimes it is criticised, well, it is no part of a regulator's job to be loved. I know that it is working hard at its efficiency and productivity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para9"></a>To go through the main provisions of the Bill in a little more detail, Clause 1 provides the key definitions. Clauses 2 to 5 provide for the regulation of minicab operators; that is, the people who accept minicab bookings. Unlike taxis, minicabs cannot be booked direct with the driver. Operators must be licensed, and to grant a licence the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para10"></a>The Bill provides also that the operator's licence specifies the premises used as operating centres. The Bill introduces for the first time the legal concept of a minicab-operating centre, with a requirement that the centre be premises: that is to ensure that there is a clearly identified place with proper records, where proper checks can be made. We surely cannot be satisfied with an operation depending on just a mobile phone on the street.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para11"></a>Clauses 6 to 11 deal with the regulation of minicab vehicles. There is a requirement that the vehicle be licensed; and to grant a licence the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the vehicle is suitable, safe, comfortable, insured, as so many are not now, and does not look like a taxi. It may be tested up to three times a year; it is subject to spot checks; and it must display a licence disc or plate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para12"></a>Clauses 12 to 14 provide for licensing of drivers. To gain a licence, a driver must be 21 and have had a licence for three years. Applicants must satisfy the Secretary of State that they possess appropriate knowledge of London and topographical skills. They are subject to the all-important criminal record checks. Once licensed, they must wear a badge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para13"></a>Clauses 15 to 29 make a range of general provisions about licences, including medical checks for drivers, powers to suspend or revoke a licence, and provisions about appeals.
<P>


<a name="column_545"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 545</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para14"></a>Clauses 30 and 31 are important provisions about signs and advertising, designed to prevent confusion--deliberate or otherwise--between minicabs and taxis. The two are different and will remain so. Clauses 32 to 40 are miscellaneous and supplementary provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para15"></a>I hope that I have said enough in that brief description to satisfy your Lordships that the Bill makes proper, sensible, comprehensive provision for minicab regulation. As I mentioned, there were some substantive amendments made in another place, to which I draw your Lordships' attention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para16"></a>Perhaps the most notable is in Clause 13, which now provides that the Secretary of State "shall", not "may"--a debate we have regularly here--require applicants for driver licences to satisfy him about their knowledge of London and their "general topographical skills". This was a point of particular importance to the taxi trade, and I am glad that the carefully balanced form of words put forward in another place found favour with the Standing Committee there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para17"></a>That committee agreed also an amendment in Clause 11 to ban taximeters from minicabs on the grounds that they can confuse passengers, perhaps newcomers to London, into believing that the vehicle is a taxi and that the fares are controlled by the Secretary of State. That is a clause that I queried, because I always thought that meters would be a good thing. It turns out however that if there are meters in minicabs they would be unauthorised and unmeasured. They could be set at any rate, and people might be misled into thinking that they were safe and that the meter was correct and honest when it could be the reverse.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para18"></a>That change was important to the taxi trade, as was the amendment to Clause 31, which I particularly welcome, to extend the ban on misleading advertisements so that minicab firms are not only unable to use words such as "taxi" or "cab" but also words which could be mistaken for them. I suggest that the public do deserve clear, straightforward advertising about the service that they are buying. There must be no blurring of the distinction between taxis and minicabs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para19"></a>Finally, the committee in the other place agreed to include what is now Clause 5, which provides for bookings to be sub-contracted to operators outside London. This amendment merely puts the law about London minicabs on the same footing as that for minicabs in the rest of England and Wales, and I suggest that it is a sensible piece of flexibility. I stress that bookings can only be sub-contracted to other operators around London who are themselves licensed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para20"></a>Nonetheless, I know that there have been suggestions that the new clause will in some sense enable operators to "flag out" and evade proper licensing controls. I frankly doubt it; but I am clear that the Public Carriage Office will be on the look-out for that sort of thing, and if it should emerge as a problem, then the Secretary of State could use his regulation-making powers to stop it. The Minister may wish to say something more about that.
<P>


<a name="column_546"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 546</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para21"></a>That is the Bill in outline, and I suggest that it contains what we would want to see as a framework for effective regulation, to give minicab customers the confidence about safety to which they should be entitled. But I can assure noble Lords that there is one thing that is not in the Bill. There is nothing in the Bill which gives minicabs the right to ply for hire--that is to say, the right to be hailed on the street, to stand at taxi ranks, with the booking being made directly with the driver. The Bill requires that all minicab bookings must be made through an operator. Plying for hire is the exclusive right of the taxi trade. That is the law at present, and it will remain the law in future, under this Bill. It seems right to stress that to the House, and I am sure that every Member present will support that view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para22"></a>I know your Lordships will want to know about enforcement, a matter generally of concern to Members of this House. No law can count for much unless it is properly enforced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para23"></a>In some ways the Bill, if it becomes law, will in itself help enforcement. Minicab operators and drivers will have an incentive to observe the law, especially the law on plying for hire, because they will have a licence to lose; at present, sadly, that is not the case. And I do not need to repeat to your Lordships the arguments that I have put before the House on many occasions about cowboy operators who have neither licence, insurance, nor fit vehicle. And members of the minicab trade who keep the law--and that is the great majority of them--will have an incentive to report those who do not, because the law-breakers will be providing unfair competition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para24"></a>But in addition there will remain the existing Metropolitan Police cab enforcement section, whose job is, among other things, to stop illegal plying for hire by minicabs; and they are of course backed up by all other officers in the Metropolitan Police, who will have their attention drawn to the new law when it comes into effect. Already the police have shown themselves very ready to mount special exercises from time to time, combined with social security and unemployment benefit checks, to check both taxis and illegal plying for hire.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para25"></a>The Metropolitan Police intend to take special steps in response to this Bill. It is envisaged that a special minicab enforcement team will be set up. It will be financed from minicab licence fees, and the job of its members, who will be civilians, will be to check that all the requirements of the Bill are being met. They will be able to make spot checks as well as more routine visits, with all the various powers that the Bill provides. Numbers have yet to be finally determined, but may well be around 20 people. And their full-time job will be enforcement of this new law. I hope that noble Lords will take reassurance from that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para26"></a>I hope that I have explained this Bill and the thinking behind it. It seeks to end an anomaly--a shocking anomaly some might say--whereby the London minicab trade is totally unregulated. The intention is to achieve that objective of regulation by applying to London essentially the same system as applies elsewhere in England and Wales. In so far as there are differences, <P>


<a name="column_547"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 547</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they are mainly to take account of representations made by interested parties--notably the taxi trade. Black taxis not only have a special status in London, but are recognised throughout the world as being without equal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para27"></a>But, above all, the Bill aims to improve the safety of the London travelling public. Minicabs play a valuable role in getting people around our capital, alongside all the other modes of transport. The number of minicabs is estimated at over 40,000--and some say it could be as high as 100,000. I do not think that we can imagine doing without them in London. I think noble Lords would agree that the minicab is here to stay; and that means that members of the public should be able to use a minicab with the same confidence as in all our other cities. "Why should London be different?", people ask. This Bill aims to ensure that London is no longer different.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para28"></a>The Bill has already been thoroughly discussed and amended in another place. It is now right that we should discuss it carefully here. I have no doubt that the Bill well justifies a place on the statute book as an overdue public safety measure. I ask your Lordships to grant this Bill a Second Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para29"></a>Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.--(Baroness Gardner of Parkes.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to follow immediately upon the speech of the proposer of the Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, because I am most supportive of it. I congratulate her most warmly on taking over the baton from Sir George Young, who piloted the Bill through another place. Most of your Lordships are well aware that for many years the noble Baroness has taken a considerable interest in the subject. She must be pleased today, but she will be even more pleased when the Bill passes into law in a short time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para30"></a>The undoubted need for the Bill arises from the anomaly--the noble Baroness used that word--that London alone among our major cities continues to have a substantial but entirely unregulated private car hire sector. It is particularly anomalous when London's regulated black cab system is the envy of the world in terms of safety, efficiency and value for money. The scandal of the private car hire, or minicab, sector in London arises from the serious risk of the unknown. The risk may come from only a minority, but it is a serious risk because when one gets into a minicab the vehicle may be unsafe, the driver may be incompetent, if not worse, and there may be no valid insurance to cover the risks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para31"></a>I live in London during the week but do not keep a car in London, so I naturally use all forms of public transport, including black cabs and minicabs. I shall not be tedious and recount to your Lordships tiresome experiences with minicabs. They were recited by many Members in another place and no doubt we all recognise them. However, I have a personal interest in the successful passage of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para32"></a>I take part in the debate because I also have a long-standing professional interest in regulation as an aid to consumer protection--in this case, passenger <P>


<a name="column_548"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 548</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protection--and in the preservation of competition, which can be inhibited by overregulation. Sometimes the two can conflict with each other. I am always wary of regulation which limits entry into a particular market because that may reduce supply unduly and it may also raise prices.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para33"></a>One must generalise and one might be wrong in particular instances, but I understand that prices charged by minicab drivers are relatively low. I often have the peculiar experience at the end of a journey when the driver asks, "What do you think is a fair price?". When one asks how much the drivers are charging they leave it to the customer. In any case, they do not seem to expect a great deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para34"></a>I am not one of those who is automatically against part-timers and, if you like, moonlighters, who wish to use their own car to pick up a bit of extra cash as well as picking up passengers to take them from A to B. Just because they are part-timers, they are not necessarily people who should be barred from the trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para35"></a>Therefore, I am glad that the Bill, for example, does not place a limit on the total number of vehicles that may be licensed. That would indeed be anti-competitive. I welcome, too, the assurances that were given in another place by the Government that the licence fees will not be excessive. I am glad that there will be so-called grandfather rights exempting established minicab drivers from the new provision to have appropriate topographical knowledge of London as required, as the noble Baroness explained, by Clause 13.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para36"></a>Indeed, we all know those stories of how hopeless drivers are about knowing where, for example, Trafalgar Square is or other key parts of London. But I hope that the reference to appropriate topographical knowledge, which has no doubt been put into Clause 13 very carefully, is not interpreted too stringently. After all, if one is a minicab driver in Shepherds Bush, then I agree that that driver should have adequate topographical knowledge of that area and how to get from Shepherds Bush to a number of key places--the airport, central London and so on. But surely it is not necessary that he should have a detailed knowledge of the side streets of Hampstead or Hackney. It seems to me that we must be careful not to overdo the requirement in Clause 13.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para37"></a>On the same theme of enhancing competition, I echo Sir George Young when he expressed concern at Second Reading in another place at the lengthening time it has been taking for potential black-cab drivers to acquire the Knowledge and the severe shortage of examiners. It is all very well for those who are already in the black cab trade but it is an unjustified barrier to entry for those potential drivers who wish to enter the market and compete. Moreover, it is certainly not in the public interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para38"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned, in terms of praise and understandable support, the way in which the black cab trade has changed its mind over a period and has come to support this Bill which licenses the private hire sector. I keep in the back of my mind some suspicion about that. Indeed, I detect certain signs--and there may be worries in the future as the detailed regulations come <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>forward from the Public Carriage Office and so on--of the black cab trade being just a little too influential concerning the details of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para39"></a>I cite the example which the noble Baroness gave; that is the way in which Clause 11 was amended in another place. As she pointed out, it was amended to forbid the equipping of private hire vehicles with meters on the grounds that a meter might confuse people into thinking that the vehicle must be a taxi. But meters provide evident consumer protection. There is or could be a degree of reassurance if a meter were allowed to be installed. Although it may not record amounts which have been approved by government or some other body, nevertheless it gives an indication, as the vehicle goes along, of what the fare is likely to be at the end of the journey, whereas at present and into the indefinite future, because meters are to be forbidden into the indefinite future, unless agreement is reached at the beginning of the journey--and that agreement would be oral in any event--a passenger will not know until the end of the journey what the fare will be. That is unless you are lucky, as I have mentioned I have sometimes been, and the driver leaves it to the passenger to suggest the amount.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para40"></a>Because it is so difficult to talk about the private hire trade without referring to black cabs, and because the two sectors will be brought closer together in terms of regulation--and it is the whole purpose of the Bill that they will both be regulated, respectable and will both have certain rules attached to them in relation to the drivers, the vehicles, insurance and so on--a long-term question inevitably arises. I leave it unanswered and in the air, but the question is for how long the black cab monopoly of the right to ply for hire will be justified.

<A NAME="80717-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, I should also like warmly to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, and particularly Sir George Young and his cross-Party co-sponsors in another place on this Bill. It is of course an anomaly that London minicabs alone are not required to be licensed. That anomaly is rightly now being corrected, and indeed the correction is overdue. It is a matter of extreme concern on public safety grounds that last year 67 people were assaulted and there were 18 rapes in minicabs. It is a matter of particular concern to women and the elderly. The elderly are often sent home from hospital in minicabs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para41"></a>The residents of London overwhelmingly support this measure. It is also supported by a large number of organisations, as the noble Baroness said. I shall not reiterate the list she gave, but perhaps I might just mention the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which has played such an important role in campaigning for safety. I should like to note the helpful and supportive role of the London Private Hire Car Association and broadly, bodies, representing the black cab trade, whose support is particularly welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para42"></a>With such a range of support, one would have expected the Bill to have a relatively smooth passage. Many citizens unfamiliar with the arcane rituals of <P>


<a name="column_550"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 550</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parliamentary procedure will have been surprised by the near-success of the maverick Mr. Eric Forth, a  self-styled campaigner against bureaucracy, in attempting to sabotage the Bill. They may also perhaps be puzzled by the slowness of the Government in acting to overcome these manoeuvres by perhaps taking over the Bill themselves. I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if I express pride in my colleagues in the other place, led by London Members such as Simon Hughes, Jenny Tonge and Tom Brake, who through their pressure--such as an Opposition Day Motion--succeeded in persuading the Government to take the necessary action to set up a Standing Committee. As the noble Baroness has just mentioned, this meant that the Bill has been examined in detail in the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para43"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the Bill represents the setting up of a regulated two-tier system and not the first step towards a one-tier system, although history may prove me wrong. The principal difference between black cabs and minicabs is, and I think will remain, the ability, or not, to ply for hire. It represents healthy competition between on-street hiring and personal booking. London taxis are special. Their drivers' Knowledge is unrivalled and I believe that we should maintain and enforce that distinction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para44"></a>I am unstinting in my admiration for London taxis, and my experience of living in Brussels for seven years just increased my admiration. I am concerned that a high proportion of the recorded assaults may have been when the ride began in the illegal hiring of a minicab on the street; and so enforcement must outlaw this. But unstinting as my admiration is for black cabs, they can by no means meet all needs. As someone who has always lived north of the river I have never suffered the "big freeze" from a cab driver reluctant to go south of the river, but anecdotal evidence of that abounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para45"></a>Less than one-tenth of black cabs operate exclusively in the suburbs and even in the inner city people who want to go to a station, an airport or a hospital would generally choose a minicab for the convenience of going door-to-door at lower cost. The segmentation of the market will, in my opinion, deepen. On the one hand, licensing of minicabs will allow enforcement to be tightened to stop illegal hiring and touting, thus preserving the exclusive right of black cabs to ply for hire. On the other hand, the reassurance that would come from the licensing of minicabs may tend to reverse the trend for the telephone ordering of black cabs which, it must be said, can be frustrating as an individual. Since so many of them are linked into company contracts, one can get pushed to the back of the queue as an ordinary mortal, a second-class "cash customer".
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para46"></a>I am glad that the black cab industry has broadly supported the Bill because I believe that the high quality of the service will ensure a thriving market. But no doubt it will take the opportunity to modernise its own industry. Like the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, I too have learnt that there are apparently only five examiners to test the Knowledge in the Public Carriage Office, which comes under the supervision of Scotland Yard. That is why it takes two to three years to pass the test. I am sure that there is no suggestion of an informal quota being enforced by limiting entrance artificially, but <P>


<a name="column_551"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 551</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>merely--and regrettably--a tale of inefficiency. It needs dealing with, and perhaps the introduction of fees for tests would enable staffing to be increased.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para47"></a>Rules must be a sensible balance between the need for safety and unnecessary over-regulation. I agree with much of what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said in that respect. It must be about a balance between preventing unfair competition and unreasonable protection of a monopoly or barriers to entry. I believe that the Bill is sensibly drawn in leaving flexibility for regulation to evolve.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para48"></a>I shall not go into great detail, partly because this is the Second Reading of the Bill. However, I have a few points to make. I have a query about the situation as regards criminal records. On topographical knowledge, I note that the wording of the clause was changed to incorporate the word "may" instead of the word "shall", but for criminal records the applicable word is "may". We recently had a debate on Scottish tuition fees regarding the difference between a strong "may" and a "shall". None the less, I remain unclear on the matter. In the other place, the Minister for Transport in London said in Committee that it was intended to make criminal record checks on applicants, including renewals. I took it that she meant every applicant, but the word "may" in the clause leaves that rather unclear. I cannot see how that wording guarantees a systematic, mandatory check for criminal records. I also understand from the background documents that the Private Hire Board says that a criminal record check takes from six to eight weeks, which seems a rather unreasonable length of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para49"></a>I agree with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, about the test for topographical knowledge for minicab drivers. It should be relatively "light touch"--for example, a knowledge of major routes, major land marks, together with the ability to read an A-Z for the detail; not, of course, as one drives along, but to obtain the precise detail of, say, the side streets of Hampstead or Hackney. As the noble Lord put it, the crucial word is "appropriate".
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para50"></a>On distinguishing marks, I understand the concern that minicabs should not carry signs that attract the public so that people can wave the cabs down in the street. However, enforcement officers need to be able to recognise a minicab. I understand that one suggestion is that a distinguishing plate should be placed on the back of the vehicle. That seems to me to be sensible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para51"></a>As regards the identification of private hire vehicle minicab offices, I am not sure that I have entirely understood the provisions in the Bill about signage. Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether the offices are meant to be unmarked. Is it not reasonable that customers should be able physically to call at a minicab office? Indeed, if one finds oneself in an area at, say, one or two o'clock in the morning and there are no black cabs on the streets, the only way to get transport is to go into a minicab office. Therefore, I assume that they will be able to be identified.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para52"></a>I have a question about door locks. My attention was drawn to the danger of these locks, which prevent passengers escaping when threatened, by an article in <P>


<a name="column_552"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 552</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Evening Standard a year or so ago. I have been unable to trace the article but, from memory, I recall that there was concern that when black cabs were sold off as being too old for commercial use they were not always sufficiently altered in appearance and markings so as to alert customers to the fact that they were no longer licensed cabs. There had been a number of apparent sex attacks in black cabs, but the suspicion was that these were--and I am glad to say this for the sake of the reputation of black cab drivers--more likely to be bogus cabs driven by criminals who had acquired former black cabs and managed to deceive customers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para53"></a>The relevance of locks is that the driver of a black cab is able to keep the doors locked by his use of the foot pedals. That is usually a sensible precaution but it is potentially a rapist's charter. I am glad to learn from remarks made in the other place by Mr. Clive Efford that there is a London Taxi Board code of conduct on the decommissioning of taxis which has been supported by the Minister for Transport in London. That would appear to take care of decommissioned black cabs. I am not sure what the position is as regards the locking of doors in black cabs in service, although as I say most black cab drivers are perfectly reliable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para54"></a>My concern with minicabs is child locks. Saloon cars often have child locks to prevent back seat passengers from opening the door. I do not expect all the detail of the Bill to be discussed now, but will the regulations take into account the potential dangers of this situation, especially for women? It could be frightening to be unable to get out of a vehicle when the driver controls the opening of the doors.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para55"></a>As regards the regulatory authority, it seems sensible to envisage the Greater London Authority taking over in due course both black cab and minicab regulation. I understand the Government have concluded that the GLA would be a good candidate for the role of regulatory authority. Perhaps that could be considered as part of the GLA Bill expected in the Autumn. In any case it is entirely fitting that the ending of this longstanding anomaly of unregulated minicabs in our capital city will coincide with London getting back a measure of self-government within the next year or so. Those responsible for this Bill's progress deserve the warmest congratulations.

<A NAME="80717-04_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Slim: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, for keeping us up to speed on this Bill. I commend the Government. I think the Bill is timely and it is what is needed. I cannot claim any great expertise in either the private hire car or London taxicab business, but for many years I have been a director of a British traffic management and traffic systems company. Obviously private hire cars and the use of taxicabs has been studied by that company.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para56"></a>I make no bones about the fact that I support the London taxicab service. I have used it for many years. As the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said, after seven years in Brussels we all know that we have an elite taxi service that you can trust. You can trust the drivers, who know where they are going. All of your Lordships have <P>


<a name="column_553"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 553</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been in cities all over the world where you meet an extraordinary chap calling himself a taxicab driver and you end up telling him where to go with a map of the city on your knee. Our black cab drivers know their business and they have to work for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para57"></a>My problem with several areas of this Bill is that I am not as confident of the enforcement side as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes. I believe that in both Houses we are awfully good at initiating good Bills, and particularly in your Lordships' House at improving them, but we are always rather weak on enforcement. I believe this Bill will need considerable enforcement. The subversives and the pirates will still be out there. On that point I ask the Minister, of this &#163;4 million that is mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, will that be mostly for paperwork to get all this going, or is provision made to give the police the support they need? We ask so much of our Metropolitan Police Force. Here is another major enforcement job that will need to be examined and progressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para58"></a>I wonder, too, whether there are other areas of enforcement where even traffic wardens might come into the picture and support the constabulary. Will the Minister tell the House how enforcement is to be done on the streets? As I say, our police have a great deal to do, and particularly at night--that is the time when those who are not properly licensed will ply their trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para59"></a>We are slightly diffident as regards enforcement. We have not been very clever at getting the 200, 300 or 1,000 cars that are unlicensed and have no MOT off the roads. In this House yesterday we talked briefly about how we enforce speed limits. I should like some further explanation. I am not knocking the Bill. It is a very good measure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para60"></a>There is an area of possible disagreement that I may have with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I refer to Clause 13. I do not think that we need to cross swords over it. I should be much more vigorous in my topographical interrogation of the man or woman who wants to ply a hire car. They must know where they are going. If they are stopping at corners, causing nonsense at traffic lights, looking at an A-to-Z with a torch in the dark or whatever, that is not good for the system of traffic in our cities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para61"></a>I suggest that there is no point in the would-be private hire car driver being interrogated by a civil servant, great though he may be, who probably travels into London by train every day from the outskirts of Surrey or Sussex. I should say that this is a good job for a retired black-taxi driver. This is an area where someone with real experience of the streets of London, day and night, has a role to play and would be of great help to the Government and the police.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para62"></a>The other day I was absolutely overcome when I accepted an invitation, together with my wife, from some 200 London black-cab drivers to see what they do once a year for disabled veterans. While we were there, we saw a large number of black-cab drivers helping disabled children by giving them a day out. I do not see that same sort of patriotism among minicab drivers. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said that they will be <P>


<a name="column_554"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 554</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>respectable. The private hire car driver has to work very hard to become respectable and part of the true London scene so that he can equate with the good works of the black-cab driver.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para63"></a>This is a good Bill and it should be supported. I wish to raise only one other small point. It was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford. It is the question of door locks. It is true that a girl on her own might want to get out of a cab. However, I assure noble Lords, having a daughter who has used minicabs, that she does not want someone else to be able to get into the cab while she is the only passenger. The questions of locking, the insurance of the passenger and everything else need more consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para64"></a>In our family, we have a man on the end of a telephone whom we call "Joe the Taxi". He is a black-cab driver with some 20 or 30 years' experience. My family and I have found that he is unsurpassed, as are all his fellows. I have to tell the House that it will be some time before I use the new private hire cars. I believe the black taxicab is the finest thing we have for that kind of business in London and I shall continue to use it.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Teviot: </B>   My Lords, again it gives me great pleasure to take part in the Second Reading of the Bill and, particularly, to congratulate my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes, as well as the Government, on their prompt action in taking it on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para65"></a>My interest in London private hire cars has been long and is not pecuniary. It may be argued, as many noble Lords have said this afternoon, that black taxis provide a superb service, with the advantage that they can ply for hire and thus be hailed in the streets. However, this service comes at a price and it is one that most Londoners cannot afford.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para66"></a>Private hire vehicles which must be booked in advance provide an alternative and affordable service. The growth of this transport sector in recent decades has been truly astonishing and is adequate testimony to its popularity. It is estimated that there are at least 40,000 minicabs; I believe my noble friend said that there could be 100,000 operating in London. The 40,000 could well be an underestimate. If we accept it, the value of the sector can clearly be shown. I am reliably informed that the average minicab does at least 10 jobs each day. If it were working for only five days each week, which may be a conservative estimate, the total number of journeys each week would be 2 million. Surely that is a major contribution to public transport in London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para67"></a>In bringing this sector into regulation for the first time, we must not undermine this valuable contribution by an excessively bureaucratic approach. In introducing controls which will get rid of the cowboys in the sector--which my noble friend also mentioned--we must not over-legislate. Cowboy operators do pose a risk and it is right that they should be driven out, but there would be a substantial risk to the public if no suitable transport option were available to them at a time of need.
<P>


<a name="column_555"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para68"></a>The Bill is needed both to bring London into line with the rest of the country and to ensure by appropriate regulation that passengers are carried in safety to their destination when they use minicabs. I support the Bill, but I have two concerns that I should like to share with your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para69"></a>I think it was implied, if not stated, in the Committee stage of the Bill in another place that testing of private hire vehicles would become a responsibility of the Public Carriage Office, as is already the case with black taxis. The present PCO test facilities which I have seen recently are too limited to cope with upwards of 40,000 additional vehicle inspections twice or three times a year. We do not need a large bureaucracy to supervise such inspections when there already exists a tried and trusted mechanism in the longstanding arrangements for private car MOT tests.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para70"></a>There is a network of competent garages, adequately supervised, ready and able to take on this enormous task of conducting upwards of 80,000 new tests a year. Since minicabs are the same as private cars, albeit used much more extensively, why not use the existing MOT arrangements two or three times a year to ensure that minicabs are fit for the purpose? Private cars carry whole families; so do minicabs. Why should not the MOT test be adequate in both cases? I would welcome some assurance from the Minister on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para71"></a>My second point has been well debated so far. It relates to the extent of the geographical and topographical knowledge to be required of licensed minicab drivers. Drivers of black taxis which ply for hire throughout London are rightly expected to have a detailed knowledge of London without having to refer to a map.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para72"></a>Following on from what the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, said, I went to the Public Carriage Office and found it interesting to see the Knowledge being conducted. Potential drivers of London black cabs will only be tested if they appear in a suit and tie; otherwise they are sent home. I cannot think of anywhere else in the country where that would happen. I met one gentleman who was an ex-cab driver who was in charge of the testing. The whole system is to be commended.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para73"></a>Drivers of black cabs who qualify for a suburban badge can ply for hire within a specified area; for example, Wimbledon or Southgate. Minicab drivers generally operate within restricted geographical areas on the basis of journeys booked in advance. It would be quite wrong for the Secretary of State, or the Public Carriage Office acting on his behalf, to require that minicab drivers achieve a level of knowledge similar to that required of drivers of black cabs holding a suburban badge. To do so would prevent many aspiring minicab drivers entering a trade where both the pick-up address and the destination are known in advance. I would welcome some assurance from the Minister on that point as well. I wish the Bill God speed.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, introduced this Bill admirably. It is interesting that many of us are repeating certain <P>


<a name="column_556"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 556</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aspects of the Bill, which is no bad thing. It draws attention to areas of concern. I was greatly assisted in my understanding of the Bill by the London Taxi Board and I am most grateful for its help. However, the views expressed are solely mine.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para74"></a>The failure to license London's minicabs, as has been required elsewhere in the country, is clearly an anomaly, and I am delighted that the Bill will finally remove this anomaly and bring London into line with the rest of the country. No longer will London's travelling public have to make do with a second-rate, unregulated system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para75"></a>I support the main intentions of the Bill--the regulation of minicabs is, after all, important and long overdue. Safety of standards and service will be improved for all passengers and especially for those who need protection, such as disabled people, women, elderly people and tourists. This legislation will, hopefully, go some way towards raising standards and levels of customer service and satisfaction enjoyed by the London licensed black cab trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para76"></a>As the Government develop an integrated transport policy, minicabs and taxis will play an ever more significant role in our everyday lives. They can ensure that public transport is available in areas where other transport providers cannot operate efficiently and, at the same time, provide an effective alternative to the use of private cars. They will also allow people to transfer between other transport termini and reach their final destinations having covered all of their journey by public transport.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para77"></a>It is important, and I am heartened to see, that there are proposals for tests on a minicab driver's health, vehicle, criminal record and topographical knowledge--to which the driver of a black cab is already subject. Minicab drivers must be required to have a working knowledge of their local streets. That is already the situation in most of the large metropolitan areas outside London where taxi and minicab drivers have to pass an identical topographical test. The effects of Clause 13 will ensure that minicab drivers can efficiently carry passengers without reference to an A-Z.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para78"></a>I would like to refer, albeit briefly, to the licensing and testing procedures for minicab and taxi drivers. The reliance upon individual tests of topographical knowledge for applicant taxi drivers means that the process is very slow and drivers have to wait a long time for appointments. The result is that growth in the licensed taxi industry has been held back and it is one of the reasons why people cannot find enough taxis on the street and have to resort to using minicabs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para79"></a>Other noble Lords may wish to join me in making a personal plea for enforcement. Once this Bill is enacted, without the resources to tackle illegally operating minicabs and those who tout and ply for hire, the same old problem will still be with us, and I hope that resources will be channelled into suitable enforcement. The noble Viscount, Lord Slim, may be interested to know that when I was a passenger on patrol in a police vehicle in the middle of one night last summer a vehicle without lights was stopped. It transpired that the vehicle was a minicab with a young lady passenger. The vehicle, among other things, had no lights, faulty brakes, <P>


<a name="column_557"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 557</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an inoperative handbrake, a faulty exhaust and bald tyres. Of purely academic interest, we could not understand why the passenger insisted on getting another minicab to continue her journey, with the possibility of encountering another defective vehicle, when black cabs were passing regularly. It is the removal of such vehicles from our roads that this Bill will, I hope, achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para80"></a>I feel sure that your Lordships will agree with me that a driver who does so when uninsured is a very dangerous menace on our roads and I hope that, at some stage, regulations will be made whereby minicab drivers are required to have with them, during working hours, their certificate of insurance, thereby facilitating enforcement. Due to some minicab operators currently operating in questionable ways, such a requirement would help to eliminate those drivers operating without insurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para81"></a>Many of the amendments made at Committee stage in the other place were important and necessary. The introduction of a clause to prohibit the use of meters was an important customer service requirement and I am pleased to note that it had the overwhelming support of Members of the Committee. Had meters been allowed, drivers would have been able to set the meter at a rate of their own choosing and then justify their exorbitant fares by claiming that the fare rate was set by the regulator. This clause quite rightly outlaws that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para82"></a>I am also delighted that a clause was added ensuring that minicab companies are not allowed to advertise using the words "taxi" or "cab". This, clearly, would cause confusion as to the service being operated. I hope that Clause 31, which brings this about, will be vigorously enforced. The Secretary of State is also provided with discretion to make regulations prohibiting minicabs from displaying any sign, notices or other feature, and I very much hope that the Secretary of State will continue with the current practice, under the London Cab Act 1973, that prohibits all such material. It is important to prevent the public from attempting to make ad hoc hirings of minicabs, which will remain illegal. By doing so, problems associated with private hire vehicles being confused with taxis will be lessened, thereby reducing the likelihood of touting and illegal hirings. It should be noted, however, that outside the capital, where local authorities have the same discretion, minicabs are often allowed to use extensive signage--but they do not have the equivalent of the London black cab. I hope that my noble friend can confirm that it is the Government's intention to apply the regulations in line with current practice and to prohibit signage on minicabs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para83"></a>A further area of some significant concern, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, is the implications of the new Clause 1. This could allow minicab drivers, licensed in districts outside London, to operate within the capital but without the necessary localised topographical knowledge. This is surely not the intention of the Bill. It is, with the proposed wording, possible for an operator to sub-contract all his work to drivers licensed in a provincial town.

<FONT SIZE=3>drive a coach and horses through the main principles of the Bill. I very much hope that my noble friend is able to reassure your Lordships that the Government will ensure, within the regulations which accompany this Bill, that sub-contracting to drivers in this fashion will be prohibited. This is, I think, an important point and I hope that my noble friend agrees that regulations will close this loophole.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para84"></a>I support the overall intentions of the Bill and hope that it will lead to the development of a much improved personal transport service in London, which will assist the Government in meeting the aims of an integrated transport policy and which will ensure a safer and better service for those who choose to use minicabs.

<A NAME="80717-04_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Winchilsea and Nottingham: </B>   My Lords, I would like to add my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes. I would also like to congratulate the Government on the part they played in rescuing this Bill from probable oblivion. Your Lordships will know that for many years now I have been connected with taxi drivers and their trade, not just in London but all over the United Kingdom. I am proud to be associated with such a fine, ancient and honourable trade. Naturally, I want it to continue in good health, as I believe all other noble Lords do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para85"></a>Your Lordships may also know that until recently I was implacably opposed to the licensing of so-called minicabs in London because I saw their licensing as signalling an end to our present system of licensed black cabs and an end of the black cabs themselves. I did not, and I do not, want that to happen. I believe that we still have the finest system of licensed taxicabs anywhere in the world--in fact, they are the envy of everywhere else.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para86"></a>So what has changed my mind? Where on the road to Damascus did the conversion take place? Perhaps it would be more accurate to ask what has happened to temper my attitude about the licensing of minicabs in London. There are several reasons for it. First, I believe that the Bill has been well thought out; secondly, I believe that more than adequate consideration has been given to London's licensed taxi drivers and their future. I do not believe that this Bill contains anything that poses a threat to their livelihood.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para87"></a>However--and it is a very big "however"--there are several matters which must be addressed that I consider to be crucially important if their livelihood is to remain unthreatened after this Bill becomes an Act. I know that it is late in the day on a Friday and that your Lordships are anxious about getting away for the weekend. But this is an important matter which will affect not just 20,000 or so licensed taxi drivers in London but will in time have an effect on other people's livelihoods as well, such as the vehicle manufacturers who make the taxis, dealers, maintenance people and the workshops that service them, not to mention the drivers' families.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para88"></a>I am also acutely aware of the time factor for the Bill itself. Nevertheless, I believe it is imperative that some of these points are fully addressed and acted on rather than leaving them to chance. I believe that our system of licensed taxis in London is far too important a matter to be left simply to chance.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para89"></a>My greatest concern and that of all the taxi associations and bodies is centred around enforcement. I believe that no legislation is worth the paper that it is printed on if it cannot be, or is not, enforced. Quite clearly, additional people will have to be employed as enforcement officers. I am glad that the Public Carriage Office of the Metropolitan Police, which currently controls and administers everything to do with licensed taxis in London, has announced that it intends to employ a substantial number of additional enforcement officers, their costs to be included in the fees charged for minicab licences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para90"></a>I ask the Minister for an assurance that this matter will be kept under review until the legislation has bedded down, because only then will we know the extent of the enforcement problem and, therefore, how many additional officers need to be employed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para91"></a>My second concern, which is very much shared by the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association, is that of signage. Several noble Lords have already mentioned the problem. I refer to roof signs and signs painted on the sides of the vehicles. Clause 30, which deals with this problem, says in subsection (1),
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may make regulations prohibiting the display in London on or from vehicles (other than licensed taxis and public service vehicles) of any sign, notice or other feature of a description specified in the regulations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para92"></a>I feel most strongly that the word "may" should be replaced by the word "shall". We have yet another "may/shall" situation. The current practice in London is not to allow minicabs to display signs. Could not that be continued?
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para93"></a>These regulations will affect not only Londoners, but the millions of people who visit London each year. How can we expect them to recognise the difference between a licensed black taxi and a licensed private hire vehicle, especially if that private hire vehicle is allowed to display a roof sign or have signs painted on its bodywork? Confusion will reign. I ask the Minister seriously to consider the prohibition on all signs on minicabs, except perhaps for the plate on the back which signifies that the vehicle is a minicab.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para94"></a>That brings me to Clauses 5 and 12 which make it allowable for a licensed operator of minicabs in London to subcontract to operators outside London who are licensed under Section 55 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 to accept bookings in London. Nearly all such companies outside London operate vehicles which have roof and bodywork signs all over them. Surely there are more than enough minicabs already operating in London without encouraging yet more.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para95"></a>While I am referring to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, I should add that in many areas of the country outside London where it is applicable, Section 55 is not working at all well. Local licensing authorities and trading standards officers are having a terrible time enforcing the regulations. They simply do not have enough manpower, and many licensed private hire operators and drivers are committing mayhem and are getting away with it. In Sheffield, for example, the city council employed two enforcement officers after adding &#163;30 to the cost of a <P>


<a name="column_560"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 560</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>minicab licence to pay for it. Those enforcement officers made a dramatic difference, resulting in numerous prosecutions and numerous licences being revoked.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para96"></a>The main difficulty with private hire is the fact that numbers are unlimited. When Sheffield City Council did a spot check on private hire operators in the city, it found that 50 per cent. of them were benefit fraudsters. Let us hope that this Bill will have the effect of reducing the total number of minicabs operating in London. At present, it is estimated that there could be up to 60,000 in London. Good enforcement should get rid of the cowboys.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para97"></a>I hope that I have expressed my concern constructively. I close by once again urging the Minister to consider taking the matter under review so that these and other changes can be made if and when they are seen to be necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_time7"></A><H5>3.32 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I start by congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, who has been involved in this matter for a very long time; the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which has brought the issue so dramatically before us over a number of years; Sir George Young, my honourable friend Dr. Jenny Tonge and the other Members who helped to bring the Bill through the first part of its passage into legislation; my colleagues in another place who assisted in ensuring that there was time for that process to take place; and everybody, including the Government, involved in helping to take the Bill, I hope, onto the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para98"></a>There has been a good deal of discussion during our debate about the differences between black cabs and minicabs. I should like to emphasise a point which was made effectively by my noble friend Lady Ludford, who pointed out that they serve two different markets. Minicabs provide a door-to-door service. It is much more difficult to get such a service from a black cab.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para99"></a>That difference is reflected in the fact that black cabs can ply for hire and their drivers can take the booking. Bookings do not have to be made through an "operator", to use the word in the Bill. That implies a special degree of trust in the driver of a black cab. Everyone respects and honours the role that the black cab has played in London life for as long as one can remember. The black cab has become a feature of tourist propaganda, novels and reminiscences. For Londoners it has become an essential part of city life. But the city is a different place from what it was even when I was growing up. Different people require different forms of transport. The minicab trade has grown up to supply a particular market. I believe that this was a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. The fact that this different market requires different support is not a reflection on the black cab trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para100"></a>We support this legislation on three main grounds. First, it is good legislation in that it gets rid of an anomaly in the law. That is always a sensible thing to do. Secondly, I do not believe that it damages the role of the black cab. My impression from talking to drivers of black cabs is that they would rather their opposition <P>


<a name="column_561"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 561</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was regulated and had to meet certain standards than have to compete against a totally unregulated market in which anyone could ply for hire at whatever cost was thought to be reasonable. Well regulated competition is fair competition and therefore in some respects it is better from the point of view of the black cab trade.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para101"></a>Thirdly, this Bill is invaluable because it goes to the heart of the need to protect passengers in what has been up to now an unregulated London minicab trade. That is the purpose of the Bill, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, has explained. The main way to do that is to introduce a licensing system that is concerned with the character of the driver, the condition of the vehicle that he or she drives and the premises that the operator uses. It is the combination of licensing plus evidence of licensing which is at the heart of the Bill. We on this side of the Chamber support that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para102"></a>I should like to reinforce some of the queries that have been raised by my noble friend. In particular, perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, who is to respond on behalf of the Government, can tell the House how the Government react to the "may/shall" issue in relation to the proposed criminal record check for drivers. That is an important issue raised by the Bill and much will depend on how the Government carry forward the particular clause that deals with it. My noble friend Lord Winchilsea and Nottingham was concerned by enforcement of the regulations. That is also an important point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para103"></a>I should like to pose two questions of my own. There has been discussion as to whether the operator should be able to have shop front-type premises and minicabs should be obliged or allowed to have meters and external signs. There are arguments for and against all of those matters. I do not propose to go through them now because I do not believe that they are relevant to the passage of this Bill, which I should like to see on the statute book during the course of this Session of Parliament. Can the Minister tell the House whether, under Clause 32 of the Bill, provision can be made by regulation to deal with these issues if it appears that they need to be dealt with? I have looked at the wording of Clause 32 and I am not certain that it enables such aspects to be dealt with.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para104"></a>Secondly, it is all very well putting together a new statute which protects, in particular, vulnerable users of this important section of public transport, but the passenger will still need to know what he or she should look for to ensure that he or she is stepping into a licensed vehicle, driven by a licensed driver, rather than an unlicensed vehicle driven by an unlicensed driver. Has any thought been given to the need to provide good publicity to explain to people what their rights are and how they can ensure that they are acting sensibly when they hire a minicab?

<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, I join other noble Lords in congratulating my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes, first, on having introduced the Bill into the House, and, secondly, on the extremely clear <P>


<a name="column_562"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 562</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explanation of it that she gave. It was one of the best explanations of a Bill that I have heard since I made one myself!
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para105"></a>As my noble friend said, we debated this issue on an Unstarred Question in May when we did not think that the Bill would ever see the light of day in your Lordships' House. I made what was effectively my Second Reading speech on that occasion, so I do not intend to weary your Lordships by repeating what I said then. Other noble Lords today have already made many of the points that I should have liked to have made, so again I shall not repeat them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para106"></a>Almost every noble Lord has talked about enforcement of action against illegal touting. In 1996, there were only 98 convictions in London for illegal touting by minicabs on the street. At least that number of offences must be committed every evening of the week in central London. I am concerned that there will now be a three-tier system of cabs in London. There will be licensed black cabs, licensed minicabs, and unlicensed, illegal vehicles touting for business, which will not of course be covered by all of the Bill's admirable provisions. It is essential that more effort is put in by the police to enforce the provisions. I have been in correspondence with the Minister for London. She reminded me that it is the duty of every police officer in London to ensure that the law is not broken. It may not be a matter for the PCO. It is for the policeman on the beat to ensure that that happens. I hope that we can have some reassurance on that point from the Minister. Having said that, I recognise that there is a large unmet demand, especially when the theatres come out, and so forth. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, referred to that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para107"></a>One of the problems seems to be--again the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, referred to it--the length of time that it is now taking for an applicant for a black cab licence to obtain his knowledge test. I am told that 30 years ago, with much the same test, it took about six months. It can now take up to three years. I hesitate to be critical of the PCO because I do not know enough about it, but I am sure that there must be scope there for efficiencies to be made and some way of speeding up the process so that some of that unmet demand can be satisfied by there being more black cabs on the road.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para108"></a>Perhaps there should be some restructuring of the fare system as well to enable black cabs to charge a little more later at night, which might encourage more drivers out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para109"></a>My other point related to Clause 5 concerning subcontracting vehicles from outside London. However, the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, dealt with the point. I seek assurance that it is not the Government's intention to allow subcontracting to be the normal method by which a significant proportion of any individual London private hire vehicle operator bookings are fulfilled. While it may not be strictly comparable, where private hire vehicles are licensed elsewhere in the country by local authorities not all local authorities adopt exactly the same standards. It is not unknown for private hire vehicles licensed by a more tolerant local authority then to work in the adjacent local authority. We should not <P>


<a name="column_563"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 563</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want that situation to arise as a result of the operation of Clause 5. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance on how that measure will work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para110"></a>My noble friend Lord Teviot wondered whether the MOT test would be adequate for the testing of vehicles. I cannot agree with my noble friend. As far as I am aware, the MOT test takes no account of the interior condition of a car. It does not make the vehicle unsafe, but it may make it uncomfortable. The public are entitled to a reasonable degree of comfort in a car and not to have torn upholstery, and so on. I believe that a more stringent test than the MOT test would be required.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para111"></a>As my noble friend Lady Gardner said, in the end the Bill had a pretty thorough going over in Standing Committee in another place. I am glad to say that "may" and "shall" were changed on topographical knowledge, a point I raised on the Unstarred Question. I can assure my noble friend that I shall not wish to put down any amendments in Committee. I hope that we may be able to take the Committee stage formally, although I cannot bind anyone else on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para112"></a>I wish my noble friend's Bill a speedy passage onto the statute book.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I, too, am glad to speak in the debate and to support the further progress of the Bill. I agree with the compliments of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, on the clarity of her introduction of the Bill on Second Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para113"></a>There was a time, only recently, when we had almost given the Bill up for lost. That was the background to the Unstarred Question tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, and debated here on 13th May when I had the opportunity to speak. But now we find it before us for Second Reading, and I was very glad to hear the support voiced for it from all parts of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para114"></a>Noble Lords will know from what I said on 13th May that I believe that it does indeed deserve such support. As and when this measure reaches the statute book--as we all hope it does; and I note with pleasure the hope of the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, that its passage will be speedy--I believe that we shall look back and wonder that it might ever have been thought a matter of doubt or even controversy that London minicabs should be regulated. Let us be clear that all this Bill does is to apply to the London minicab trade essentially the same system of regulation as already exists, and has existed for many years, for minicabs in the rest of England and Wales. It is no more than that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para115"></a>I am particularly grateful to the London Taxi Board for the opportunity it gave me to meet with it yesterday. It added greatly to my knowledge of the issues involved in dealing with the Bill as expeditiously as possible. I join the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, and the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, in paying tribute to the reputation of and service given by our black cabs. I know that the point is widely recognised, but perhaps it is worth repeating to show that there is nothing very startling <P>


<a name="column_564"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 564</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about this measure. It brings into effect in London a situation which applies elsewhere in England and Wales. The question is, perhaps, why the Bill has not been brought forward previously. There have been too many horror stories for far too long about attacks on minicab passengers in London. I am glad that your Lordships' House has shown such readiness to provide a remedy for this gap in the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para116"></a>Before going further I, too, must acknowledge the role played both today and over previous years by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, in promoting the cause of London minicab regulation. Through her association with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, she has for long been associated with this issue and I am delighted that she has had this opportunity of commending the Bill to your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para117"></a>I am also glad to praise Sir George Young for choosing this Bill when he came high in the ballot, and for his enormously hard work in sponsoring it. Thank goodness, it is not a party matter, and I am happy to offer thanks to Sir George for all he has done. I am very glad that the Government were able to give him assistance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para118"></a>I should make a few points on behalf of the Government. The first is just to repeat, as I said in May, that if this Bill should fall the Government will introduce its own measure as soon as parliamentary time permits. Noble Lords will understand that I cannot be any more precise than that, but the commitment remains. However, I stress that we all hope that that will not be necessary and that the Bill before us today will gain Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para119"></a>I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, that the very thorough examination which the Bill had in Committee in the other place has left it a better Bill. I hope that your Lordships will conclude that it should be allowed to remain as it stands before us today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para120"></a>It was subject to a number of amendments in the other place. Several of them were technical, though certainly worthwhile for all that, in a Bill which has to stand the test of time. But some others were more substantive, and I believe they show that Sir George Young and Ministers listened with an open mind to representations that were made to them. I know that there were concerns about some aspects of the Bill in its original form. I hope that noble Lords will agree that a proper and constructive response has now been made to those concerns and that the Bill strikes an appropriate balance between various considerations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para121"></a>On key matters, however, the Bill remains unchanged. It still provides for the regulation of drivers, vehicles and operators, just as in the rest of England and Wales. The House would expect no less. The regulatory function is for the Secretary of State, but I can confirm that it would be his intention to use his powers under the Bill to delegate those functions to the Metropolitan Police, and thus to the Public Carriage Office, which already regulates the London taxi trade, rightly regarded as one of the finest in the world.
<P>


<a name="column_565"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 565</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para122"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, and the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, raised the issue of sub-contracting. One amendment made in another place was to insert what is now Clause 5, which provides, among other things, that London minicab operators are able to sub-contract bookings to operators outside London. I know that some concern has been expressed about this.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para123"></a>The first thing to say is that the new provision only puts London operators on exactly the same footing as operators anywhere else in England and Wales, where sub-contracting across a local authority boundary is legally possible. I am not aware that it is a problem elsewhere, and I do not expect it to be in London. It represents only a degree of operational flexibility, to help ensure that customers get a good service. It would be hard to justify a provision for London which was more restrictive than in other parts of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para124"></a>Secondly, I would stress that sub-contracting is only permitted to other licensed operators in England and Wales. The clause is very clear on that. By law, licensed operators must use only drivers who and vehicles which are also licensed, and by the same licensing authority. I am sure that noble Lords would expect no less.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para125"></a>Concern has been expressed as to whether there may be a loophole in connection with Clause 5. But in that crucial sense there is no loophole at all. It wholly maintains the basic principle of the Bill, which is to give minicab customers confidence that they are using operators, drivers and vehicles that are all properly licensed in London or elsewhere. In that way, customers can be sure that the vehicles are safe and that people with convictions for violence or sexual offences have been excluded. That is exactly what Clause 5 achieves.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para126"></a>The present position in London is that the minicab trade is not regulated at all. That must be perceived to be the biggest loophole of all. In Brighton, Birmingham or Preston people who use minicabs have the confidence that a proper licensing system is in force. But that is not so in London. This Bill would close that loophole. The provision of subcontracting merely acknowledges that minicabs outside London are regulated properly and can be used as such.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para127"></a>Nevertheless, subcontracting will be monitored in London. It is intended that operators will be required to keep information about subcontracting as part of the records of each booking which will have to be maintained under Clause 4(3)(b). The Public Carriage Office will check on the extent and nature of subcontracting in monitoring those booking records.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para128"></a>If, having regard to what the records show and other relevant circumstances, it appeared to the PCO that subcontracting, either in general or by particular operators, was going far beyond reasonable business practice to such an extent that it was a cause of concern, then it would consider what action to take.  In particular, it would consider also whether to recommend to the Secretary of State that he should consider using his powers under Clause 3(4) to make regulations in respect of licence conditions. The PCO could itself consider whether to use Clause 3(4) powers to impose conditions on individual licences. Both the PCO and the Secretary <P>


<a name="column_566"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of State would wish to consider, in the light of all the circumstances, whether the public interest was being harmed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para129"></a>The question has been raised as to when the PCO or the Secretary of State would use their powers. It is not possible, sensible or even helpful for me to speculate. Everything must depend on the circumstances and at present it would be hypothetical circumstances at that. A problem may not arise. I understand that there have not been difficulties in relation to subcontracting outside London, and I do not think it right to set the rules for something which has not yet happened, which may not happen and where all concerned will need to look at the circumstances if and when they arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para130"></a>Nevertheless, it may be helpful if I place on record a quotation from a letter which the Minister for Transport in London sent to the London Taxi Board recently. She said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the abuse which you fear were to transpire (and I am doubtful that it will) Ministers could if need be take action by way of regulations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para131"></a>I know that that was a concern of the noble Lord, Lord Teviot. Therefore, the situation will be monitored. It is far from clear that there will be a problem requiring action on public interest grounds. But there are adequate powers under the Bill for action to be taken if it were deemed necessary. I hope the House will take reassurance from that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para132"></a>The issue of enforcement has been raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, and the noble Viscount, Lord Slim. That is an extremely important issue. Plying for hire by minicabs is already illegal, as several noble Lords have noted. This Bill makes no difference to the law on that. The right to ply for hire will remain the exclusive province of the taxi trade. Plying for hire by minicabs will remain illegal and I must stress that to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para133"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, that the Bill, when it becomes law, will make a practical difference because there will be an extra sanction against people who ply for hire illegally. In future, if the minicab trade is licensed, then licensed drivers who are caught plying for hire will risk losing their licence as well as being punished for breaking the law on plying for hire. The operators to whom most drivers are attached will also have to explain themselves and if a driver is caught plying for hire without a minicab driver's licence that will be an extra offence with which he or she can be charged.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para134"></a>It has been suggested that the introduction of licensing means that the respectable licensed minicab trade will have its own reputation and livelihood to protect. It, quite as much as the police, wants to see any third tier of unlicensed minicabs firmly put out of business. We can therefore expect that the licensed minicab trade will be keen to inform the police of any illegal unlicensed activity in its area.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para135"></a>The role of the Metropolitan Police was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes and by the noble and gallant Viscount, Lord Slim. The Metropolitan Police, for its part, already has the cab enforcement section aimed particularly at illegal plying <P>


<a name="column_567"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 567</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for hire by minicabs and touting by taxis and minicabs. The rest of the Metropolitan Police of course will have its continuing duty to enforce the law. That can include the mounting of special exercises on illegal plying for hire, as already happens from time to time, involving police officers in plain clothes if need be, to take drivers who are acting illegally by surprise. That, I think, is the sort of action the House will expect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para136"></a>The new law on minicab licensing will deserve its own enforcement resources. I can confirm that the Public Carriage Office intends to set up a special minicab enforcement team if the Bill becomes law. It may number perhaps 20 civilians, though that has yet to be decided. The PCO will be approaching its planning work with renewed vigour now that the Bill has made fresh progress. Its job will be to check that the provisions of the Bill are properly observed. That will entail not only routine visits but also unannounced spot checks on operators' premises and on drivers and their vehicles. Among other things, this will include regular checks that the operators are keeping proper records of bookings, so that there will be a proper incentive on all those who are licensed to make sure that they keep to the high standards required by the licences. I might add, incidentally, that the PCO intends to set up liaison arrangements with their opposite-number licensing authorities in local authorities around London. Among other things, that may be relevant to issues surrounding sub-contracting.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para137"></a>Finally, I turn to enforcement--the point which was particularly stressed by the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara--the issue of the third tier of unlicensed shady minicabs as well as the upper tiers of licensed taxis and licensed minicabs. Let us remember that at present in London, and only London of all our cities, there is no way of telling which is a shady unreliable minicab and which is not. In future, licensed vehicles will be required to display licence plates and licensed drivers will be required to wear badges. Operators' licences will have to be displayed in operating centres. So even if there is a so-called third tier, the customer will be able to see who is respectable and safe and who is not, and so will the police. That is surely a crucial step forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para138"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, also raised the question of publicity being given when these changes occur so that the public are aware of them. That is a very important point and one to which we shall wish to give great consideration. Other issues regarding safety have been raised. Perhaps I could say that the issue which was raised by the noble and gallant Viscount, Lord Slim, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, regarding door locks on minicabs will be a matter for regulations and there will be an opportunity for consultation. I think the two contributions demonstrated that there is not a clear and unambiguous answer to the point that was raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para139"></a>It is important that we also look at the issue which was raised by several noble Lords, the noble Viscount, my noble friend Lord Simon, the noble Earl, Lord Winchilsea and Nottingham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford--the issue of signing. The worry is that minicabs would be allowed to carry such large signs and advertisements that there could be confusion with taxis <P>


<a name="column_568"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the problems as regards the illegal plying for hire. That is just one of the issues that has been raised. We understand that concern, especially as the present law is very restricted on signage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para140"></a>In Clause 30, the Bill makes provision for the Secretary of State to make regulations on signs and notices. Of course, there will be consultation before any regulations are made. I can say now that it is envisaged that the approach will still be generally restrictive. It is also worth adding that the power in Clause 30 can apply to all vehicles and not just to London minicabs. Therefore, any restriction could be quite comprehensive in that it could cover vehicles which were operating in London. I hope that that reassures noble Lords. I can assure the noble Earl, Lord Winchilsea, that we certainly envisage making regulations under Clause 30.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para141"></a>The issue of minicab offices and advertising was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford. Such offices can be identified under the Bill, but what they must not do is to advertise taxi or car services when they only have minicabs. The noble Baroness also raised the question of the Greater London Authority. I can tell her that it is envisaged that the Public Carriage Office will transfer to the GLA and, in particular, to transport for London as she suggested. Moreover, as the noble Baroness also suggested, the necessary provision will be needed in the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para142"></a>The noble Baroness also raised a point on the issue of criminal record checks and asked whether such checks would really be made. I can assure the noble Baroness that the "may" that relates to criminal record checks is indeed a strong "may"; indeed, it will be standard procedure to make a criminal record check. However, it is just possible that some flexibility will be needed in that respect--for example, for someone who is moving from elsewhere with a minicab driver's licence where he or she has just had a criminal record check. None of us would wish unnecessary checks to be made, but I can assure the House that we see such checks as being crucial.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para143"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teviot, suggested that perhaps there were too many minicabs for all of them to be tested at the existing PCO premises in Islington. It is envisaged that the tests will be contracted out to selected garages which already carry out MoT tests for the department. It is hoped that this, too, might be done within 12 months, although it is too early to give cast iron dates for such a full test. Once the licence system is up and running, it is envisaged that vehicles may well have to be tested more than once a year. The Bill provides for that to take place up to three times a year, recognising that these tend to be high mileage vehicles. It is also envisaged that the test will go beyond the basic MoT test to cover, for example, the internal condition of the vehicle--a point raised by noble Lords--so that passenger comfort and safety could be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para144"></a>I also recognise the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, that the MoT standard test has served us well for many years. We must beware of over-regulation. I am sure that the noble Lord's point <P>


<a name="column_569"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 569</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be taken well into account during the consultation on our proposals regarding the vehicle testing regime. I hope that the noble Lord is reassured on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para145"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie and the noble Earl, Lord Winchilsea, also asked about the level of licence fees under the new regulatory regime. Frankly, it is too early to give any firm figures, but I can assure the House that the Public Carriage Office will very much bear in mind the fees charged for various licences elsewhere in the country. I would only qualify that in two ways. First, there is quite a range of fees as charged between one authority and another; and, secondly, when quoting a fee, one has to be careful to look at the time for which the licence applies to attain an annual rate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para146"></a>I can assure the noble Earl, Lord Winchilsea and Nottingham, that the need for enforcement and to use resources well will be taken fully into account and kept under review. Topographical knowledge tests have been mentioned by the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Teviot, among others. This issue needs to be carefully considered by the Public Carriage Office. I believe it is not helpful for me to engage in speculation here. However, there will be consultation on what is proposed. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said that we should strike a careful balance here and have regard to grandfather rights of existing drivers. We shall certainly bear that in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para147"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teviot, has suggested that any knowledge test should not be so unreasonable as to create bureaucratic barriers to entry to the minicab trade, bearing in mind that minicab drivers do not ply for hire on the streets as taxi drivers do. We understand the noble Lord's point. I shall certainly ensure that it is drawn to the attention of the Public Carriage Office so that it can be considered alongside the many other representations that I feel sure it will receive on this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para148"></a>Reference has been made to the time taken to pass the taxi knowledge test at present. We understand the concerns that have been raised in this regard, as does the Public Carriage Office, which is already working on improvements and streamlining the procedures while maintaining the quality standards which are so important. We take the point about recruiting examiners. That is an extremely important point which we shall bear in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para149"></a>I end as I began by stressing the value of this Bill. In all its detail it is easy to lose sight of the essential point that it achieves for London that which has already been achieved elsewhere in England and Wales; namely, a proper system of regulation. It is not a novel Bill; it merely brings London into line with the rest of the country on this crucial issue of public safety. The intention of the Bill is to reassure people that their daughters, sons and other vulnerable people are not being driven home late at night by convicted rapists, and that the car they are driven in does not have weak brakes or cannot be properly steered. These are rather stark terms in which to express the issues in the Bill. Elsewhere in the country these safeguards are in place but that is not the case in London at the moment.

<A NAME = "80717-04_para150"></a>I apologise to noble Lords for the length of time I have taken to try to reply to every single point. The only excuse I can offer is that, like the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, I wish to see this Bill, and the protection it offers, on the statute book at the earliest possible moment.

<P>
<A NAME="80717-04_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, we have had a full and constructive debate this afternoon. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have participated in it. I was pleasantly surprised at the number of noble Lords who have taken the trouble to remain here late on a Friday afternoon. I am also grateful to the Minister for her reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para151"></a>It was not, of course, our fault that this debate followed the Second Reading of the Landmines Bill which meant that we had a late start. A couple of points have been raised which I feel have not been covered in the Minister's reply. I wish to comment on those points as briefly as possible, bearing in mind that everyone wants to go home.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para152"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said he was anxious that people should not be prevented from entering the market. I, too, was concerned about that point. I wondered about the man who just wants to operate a minicab as a one-man affair. It turned out that that could be possible under the Bill. His wife could be the operator receiving the calls at home; they must be taken by some other person. But there is nothing to prevent a single person starting a company that could develop into a large enterprise. That reassured me. I did not want to introduce a Bill that could create massive empires for people who had large groups of cars and eliminate the small enterprise. So I was pleased to know that that was the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para153"></a>A point that has not been made in relation to meters is that black cabs must use the most direct route. Therefore a passenger knows that the price on the meter is the minimum charge for the journey. But if a driver does not have the same degree of topographical knowledge, he may use a different route or get lost, and the meter would then be rather out of touch.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para154"></a>I thought that my noble friends Lord Teviot and Lord Brabazon were not in conflict as regards the use of garages that do MOT tests. The principle of using such garages and subcontracting the work is excellent. Matters such as the interior of a minicab would be taken into account. There are certain standards set for black cabs by the Public Carriage Office and the regulations could cover such points.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para155"></a>I found the comments of the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, very interesting. However, he said that the topographical knowledge is the same for black-cab drivers and others outside London. That may be true, but it is only in London that an unbelievably high standard in "the knowledge" applies. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, said that 30 years ago it took six months to learn. But 30 years ago the road systems in London were rather different. The complexity of routes and one-way systems was not the same. So, while I <P>


<a name="column_571"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 571</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appreciate that the shortage of examiners may be a feature, there is a far greater degree of knowledge to be learnt; almost week by week in London everything changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para156"></a>I wish to reassure the noble Earl, Lord Winchilsea and Nottingham, who was concerned about enforcement. We are all concerned. However, the noble Earl should bear in mind that there is no enforcement at present. We are looking at a million per cent. improvement on the present situation. The only enforcement that presently exists is a small amount of provision on plying for hire. There is no other protection. I believe that that is why those in the black-taxi trade are no longer opposed to the measure; they see how hopeless the present situation is.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para157"></a>Signage is an issue. It is important that signs should be clearly recognisable on a minicab, and that the person who receives the cab in response to a telephone call knows that the car that has arrived is a minicab. So a degree of signage is necessary. The noble Earl, Lord Winchilsea and Nottingham, said that visitors to London might find it confusing. That is true. Japanese tourists found it very confusing, having been advised to take a black cab from the airport, when they arrived to find cabs painted pink, green and yellow. They said, "I'm not getting into that. It must be a black cab", and they did not; they waited until they could find a black one. So visitors are easily confused. There has, therefore, to <P>


<a name="column_572"></a>

<B>17 Jul 1998 : Column 572</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be sufficient signing, and yet not enough to constitute an advertisement or to contravene the position of black taxis.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para158"></a>I thank the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, for his contribution. The point about door locks has already been covered by the Minister. The Minister was perhaps mistaken in saying that the offices will not be able to advertise "taxi" or "car" on their premises. I think they will not be able to advertise using the words "taxi" or "cab"; however, I believe that the word "car" will be allowed. Perhaps the Minister will check that point in Hansard. Although the technical phrase may be, "licensed hackney carriage", what member of the public will know that phrase? To the public it is a "taxi". What member of the public will say, "I'm ordering a private hire vehicle"? Everyone will order a "minicab" by telephone. Those are the words that people know. They create no confusion, and will be of benefit to everyone.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717-04_para159"></a>I believe that the Bill has merit, and that the proper regulation of minicabs is long overdue. I am glad that so many noble Lords have supported the Bill. I ask the House to give it a Second Reading so that London will be a safer place for those who travel and live here, and for those visitors who come from overseas. I commend the Bill to the House.

<A NAME="80717w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  The Government have made no such central assessment, these being matters for local decision making.

The National Health Service Executive in the North West will find the reports, against the backdrop of the cancer targets in the Green and White Papers and the ongoing implementation of the Calman/Hine recommendations, useful locally for formulating and assessing bids for radiotherapy resources.

Together with other European Union member states, we abstained on the United Nations General Assembly resolution on this issue because we did not wish to prejudge the outcome of further disarmament debate within the Conference on Disarmament.

<P>
<A NAME="80717w02_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they will announce the conclusions of the Financial Management and Policy Review of the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee.[HL2852]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80717w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  We have today published the report of the steering committee guiding the Financial Management and Policy Review of the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC). Copies of the report, which was completed in March 1997, including a list of those who responded to the consultation exercise, have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717w02_para0"></a>The conclusion of the prior options stage of the review were announced by the previous Government on 28 November 1996. This was that RWMAC should continue to operate for at least the next five years. It was also announced at that time that the steering committee would go on to consider the structure and operation of RWMAC. The report being published today sets out the considerations leading to the decision that RWMAC should continue, and the steering committee's proposals for modifying the structure and operation of the committee to suit current requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717w02_para1"></a>The Government welcome the majority of the steering committee's recommendations but have given further consideration to two of the recommendations; the membership template and the deletion of "civil" from RWMAC's terms of reference to reflect its practice, now well established under invitation, of also considering the management of radioactive waste from defence establishments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717w02_para2"></a>The membership template has been amended to place a greater emphasis on environmental and societal perspectives and lay perspectives. The new membership template printed below will become an attachment to all copies of the steering committee's report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717w02_para3"></a>Consideration of the proposed amendment to RWMAC's terms of reference will be deferred until the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology has reported on nuclear waste management.
<P>

<A NAME = "80717w02_para4"></a>We along with my right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales have accepted all the other recommendations made by the steering committee.
