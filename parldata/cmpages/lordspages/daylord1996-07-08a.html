<A NAME = "60708-01_head0"></A><H3><center>European Union: British Presidency</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress has so far been made in preparations for the next British presidency of the European Union in January 1998.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, preliminary consultations have already taken place with Whitehall departments on planning for the next presidency. Detailed preparations will begin in the autumn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the Government have approached a number of private companies to help to subscribe to the cost of the British presidency in 1998? Will she explain to us why the Government have done that because it seems to me to be a form of voluntary taxation? I assume that the Government have not offered any privileges or assurances on policy to companies in return for subscribing. Will she tell the House whether only British companies have been approached or whether American, Japanese and German companies with substantial premises in the United Kingdom have also been approached?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, first, we are only considering the possibility of commercial <P>


<a name="column_2"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sponsorship for events during the British presidency. I assure your Lordships that any sponsorship would have to be compatible with the proper management and dignity of the presidency. There is no question of anybody who might come forward having any privilege or policy influence during the presidency.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-01_para0"></a>I should point out to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that commercial sponsorship for such events is not new. Some sponsorship was offered in 1992. There was sponsorship for the Canadian G7 summit in Halifax last year and also significant sponsorship for the recent G7 summit in Lyon. There is no negotiation taking place at present. I have no idea who may come forward. But if companies are willing, then that is one way in which to defray the costs. I would describe it as willing taxation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wright of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the approach being considered to business does not relate solely to the British presidency of the European Union but also to other major international meetings which we shall be hosting at about the same time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, is absolutely correct. In recent years, major meetings have repeatedly been offered such sponsorship, whether they be European Union or any other sort of meetings. If companies are so willing, because they believe it is right, that we should have those discussions then I do not believe it is a bad way to defray the costs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend not push aside those rather narrow-minded and dark xenophobic mutterings suggesting that it would be wrong to accept help from companies in Britain merely because they are foreign? More to the point, fonctionnaires in Brussels are reported to have said that it would be unacceptable for the Prime Minister to pursue his policy of blocking progress at the IGC unless we have an agreement on matters such as the 48-hour working week directive. Does the Minister not agree <P>


<a name="column_3"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that if that is not brushed aside from Brussels, it may be that the IGC will still be going on in January 1998 when the British presidency takes over?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, both in your Lordships' House and long before that in another place, I have become quite used--as I know my noble friend did--to putting mutterings aside. It is a very useful habit to be able to put mutterings aside. I assure my noble friend that we shall put firmly in their place any fonctionnaires. There is no way in which we shall be dictated to in that regard. It does not matter what is the issue: we shall stand up for Britain. It is as straightforward and as simple as that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness answer two questions? First, since 1st January 1998 will be running very close to decision-making time on a single currency, by that time will Parliament have had the opportunity to declare its will on whether or not we should enter the third stage of EMU and the single currency? Secondly, are reports correct which appeared in yesterday's press that the Attorney-General has advised the Prime Minister and other Ministers that if they do not implement European law on the 48-hour week they will be liable to prosecution and, indeed, they may be in gaol when we next have the presidency?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, first, I have no idea what will be the parliamentary programme for 1997. Therefore, I cannot answer the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, as to whether Parliament will have taken that decision. To a large extent, it depends on my noble friend's earlier question as to whether by that time matters are in a state of completeness at which the British Parliament will be asked--and it will be asked--to make a decision. The Attorney-General may have given such advice but he has not told me about it. Certainly, I do not believe everything that I read in the newspapers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, whatever happens--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Viscount Cranborne): </B>  My Lords, I am sure we have time for both noble Lords. I wonder whether the House might think that perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, might come before the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, but not of course as a matter of general precedence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, whatever may or may not happen in 1997, does the Minister recall that in 1998, during the British presidency, it will be up to those at the heads of government meeting to take the final decision about economic and monetary union? If by any chance the present Government were still in office at that time, would not their pathetic opt-out on the single currency mean that their presidency of those <P>


<a name="column_4"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>meetings would result in our lacking all influence in looking after one of our most important interests; namely, our financial interest?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I have never said this to the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, before, but that was a load of nonsense. I say that because it is perfectly likely that there will be another Conservative Government in 1998. Whatever decisions are to be made, we shall not only do what is right for this country but we shall also certainly examine all these matters in the proper way. I must point out to the noble Lord that even if a decision is made about a single currency, there are 11 other countries besides ourselves who at this moment do not meet the criteria. There will probably still be a large number of others by 1998.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister ignore the xenophobic views of her noble friend Lord Tebbit, or my noble friend Lord Stoddart, and tell us whether, even if by some miracle the present Government are in office in 1998, they will not make any plans before then that would exclude the possibility of joining an economic and monetary union?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, knows full well that we have not excluded any possibility; neither have we made any plans. We are working to see what is best for Britain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, when the United Kingdom takes over the presidency will it be able to insist that all the other member states start to obey European legislation as well as we do? By way of example of our good behaviour in that respect, can my noble friend confirm that the Government will obey the Public Services Contracts Regulations of 1993 which implemented EC directive 92/50, and therefore put the contracts for slaughtering our cattle out to tender, thus saving hundreds of related businesses from bankruptcy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, that question is a long way away from the original. I shall consider it in detail and write to my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that this Question is somewhat academic as regards her Government? However, she will be glad to know that the Opposition--soon to be the government--are well advanced in making preparations for the British presidency as from 1st January 1998. Will the Minister be a little more specific as to what sponsorship is intended to cover? Presumably it cannot possibly cover any questions of policy. Presumably, also, the Government will not give any assurances to those providing the sponsorship of any promises in return for that sponsorship.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, what happens next year is not academic. It is extremely important for the British people. It is interesting that I have heard the noble Lord say three times before <P>


<a name="column_5"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that he thought this might be the outcome after the next election. He has been wrong three times; I hope he will be wrong a fourth time. He asked about the influence of any sponsor on questions of policy. I made it quite clear to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that there will be no such influence, but sponsorship would help to defray the costs, certainly of feeding people.

<P>

<A NAME = "60708-02_time0"></A><H5>2.47 p.m. </H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter </B>  asked the Chairman of Committees:
<P>
<UL>Why Starred Questions are not permitted at Sittings of the House on Fridays.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Boston of Faversham): </B>  My Lords, on 10th January 1995 the House agreed to a recommendation of the Procedure Committee that no Starred Questions should be taken on Fridays. That recommendation was in line with a recommendation of the Group on Sittings of the House chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Rippon of Hexham.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, is not the real reason that Ministers do not wish to be cajoled into returning here on a Friday in order to answer Questions? Will he assure the House that Ministers are willing to turn up on Friday to answer Questions put by noble Lords?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, as I have had occasion to say to the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, on a previous occasion, it is not my duty to defend either Ministers or aspiring Ministers, but I have no doubt whatsoever that our present Ministers will do whatever the House requires of them as regards the proceedings of this House. To go back to the original part of the supplementary question of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, it is not the case that this proposal was intended to have that effect for either Ministers, aspiring Ministers or indeed Front-Benchers in any other part of the House. It was part of a package of proposals which were put forward by the Group on Sittings of the House chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Rippon, aimed at saving the time of your Lordships' House, especially late at night, so that we could rise at a more civilised hour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, is not the real reason behind the real reason not that Ministers are unwilling to appear before the House but that their civil servants wish to send them off on visits around the country to keep them out of mischief?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spmin2"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, if I am not answerable for Ministers, I am even less answerable for their civil servants. As I have also had occasion to suggest to your Lordships before, I feel that not only Ministers but other Front Bench Members of your Lordships' House have other duties <P>


<a name="column_6"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the nation than appearing here. They have a duty to get round the country, and indeed abroad, to further the interests of the nation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, can it possibly be the case that certain noble Lords who like to ask a lot of Questions would wish to ask many more?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spmin3"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, that may well be the case. However, if that were so there would be many more Answers too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, under the present arrangements the House is able to put down some 15 or 16 Questions a week. Those Questions are usually to the point and are answered with a remarkable degree of clarity which is not always available in another place. Is it not in the interests of the House that on a sitting day Members can ask specific Questions, in particular in regard to EEC matters which occupy a large amount of reading time of all Members of your Lordships' House? On balance it might be advantageous, if only for clarity, to have Questions on Friday as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spmin4"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, on a previous occasion before an intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, I was rash enough to note that he had not intervened on that Question on a European matter. He has now intervened even without my provocation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-02_para0"></a>The noble Lord raises a serious point. There is great substance in what he says about the tabling and answering of Questions. However, Friday Sittings are a different matter. After a great deal of consideration by the Group on the Sittings of the House, the proposal was specifically recommended as a means of saving additional time. Coupled with that recommendation was the group's expectation that the House would not sit beyond 2.30 in the afternoon on those additional Fridays. That would leave only three and half hours. If we were to have Starred Questions on a Friday as well it would diminish by half an hour the sitting time for a normal Friday Sitting.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-02_para1"></a>The aim is to save time and to enable your Lordships to rise earlier. I suggest that we would not wish to prejudice that time saving.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, following the point made by my noble friend Lord Bruce, would it not be a good idea to have EEC Questions only on a Friday? Then one would have no Friday Sittings!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spmin5"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Desai, tempts me. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker of Wallasey, said on a previous occasion, I am apt to resist temptation sometimes.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Bull-bars: EC Directive
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-02_time1"></A><H5>2.52 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spopq1"></A><B> The Earl of Kinnoull </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps they are taking to ensure that the European Commission introduces an amendment to Directive 74/483/EEC so as to prohibit the use of bull-bars on road vehicles.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spmin6"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport   (Viscount Goschen): </B>  My Lords, the Commission has recently proposed an amendment to the External Projections Directive which would control the fitment of aggressive bull-bars. A working group has been set up to develop the proposals further and the department is actively involved in this work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Kinnoull: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that encouraging reply. What is the timing of the next stage of the Commission's progress? How soon is a European directive expected?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is right to say that there has been progress. A specific working group has been set up to discuss the issue. There is a meeting on 16th July. We hope that there will be some progress. We have commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory to inform our thinking on this matter. It is clear that there are still significant difficulties in reaching an agreement, but we are working hard towards one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, the House will have been interested in the Minister's initial reply, in particular the reference to "aggressive" bull-bars. Will he explain the difference between aggressive bull-bars and any other bull-bars?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, yes, aggressive bull-bars are those that would do the most damage to pedestrians. There are other types of bull-bars which are not necessarily thick, steel, sharp-edged bars. There are those made out of deformable plastic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is it well known in Europe that "bull-bars" is the British term? "Roo-bars" is what the term is in the country where they originated; and they were designed to protect the driver because a vehicle radiator is rapidly smashed by a large kangaroo colliding with it, and dusk is the most dangerous time. As a member of the Parliamentary Advisory Council on Transport Safety, perhaps I may say that it is important that we do everything we can to press for the prohibition of these bars, which are not appropriate in Europe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend. We rely on her for marsupial advice on these matters. But she is right. It is an important issue, on which we are working hard to bring about a solution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Viscount confirm to the House that the Government <P>


<a name="column_8"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have received the permission of the European Commission for a proposal to be introduced for the amendment of the legislation? If they have received permission, it must be counted considerably to their credit, because under the treaty only the Commission can originate a proposal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew13"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the Commission has recently proposed an amendment to the directive. We welcome the Commission's involvement. My honourable friend the Minister for Road Safety, Steven Norris, had a meeting with the European Commissioner, Mr. Kinnock, at which it was agreed that a European approach was the best way forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, would it have been possible for the British Government to have made these bull-bars illegal without the involvement of the European Commission, if that is what we had wished to do?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-02_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, there are powers under the Road Traffic Act, but there are difficulties. A vehicle with the optional equipment of bull-bars could be type approved, in which case we would be bound to accept it. That is why we do not believe that national action is appropriate without having first overcome the European problem.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, since there are hundreds of deaths and injuries every year as a result of bull-bars and only 11 reported cases of CJD, will the Government now pursue a policy of non-cooperation with the European Union until it agrees to a measure which would save lives and injuries in this country?
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-03_para0"></a>The noble Viscount was sitting on the Bench when my noble friend Lord Barnett accused me and the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, of xenophobia. Did he hear anything in my two very reasonable questions to suggest that I was xenophobic in any way?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I always listen carefully at Question Time. But I do not answer for the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. I answer for Her Majesty's Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-03_para1"></a>I should have been disappointed had the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, not come up with a bovine reference of some kind. Research has been done into injuries which have resulted in fatalities through the use of bull-bars. Current research tends to indicate that the figure is rather lower than was originally supposed. It is not in the realm of hundreds but is a much smaller figure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, will the Government not be too precipitate in action against bull-bars? Bull-bars have many useful purposes. There are many items that one can tie to them, including a balloon, if one so wishes, when there is no other way of raising it to the sky.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his helpful advice on ballooning matters. <P>


<a name="column_9"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There are a number of legitimate uses for bull-bars. We have been concerned that they have tended to be fitted merely as a fashion accessory rather than for any practical purpose. However, a number of different people, including farmers and gamekeepers, have practical uses for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that we should move from bovine, marsupial and ballooning matters to the reality of the situation? As he indicated, we are encouraging further progress at Commission level. However, does he agree that the directive relates only to the construction of new vehicles? Vehicles currently fitted with bull-bars will not be affected. Does he further recognise that there are measures available in the United Kingdom to deal with the situation? Does he have any intention of taking action, particularly in the light of the inquiry that he caused to be made into the matter? Perhaps he would like to focus on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, the thrust of our inquiry is towards addressing the problem of new vehicles being fitted with bull-bars. We have not ruled out retrospective action, but a number of significant difficulties are involved and we would have to consider carefully the appropriateness of such action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, the great majority of schools in Scotland follow courses leading to qualifications offered by the Scottish Examination Board. There are no plans to alter the content of the Standard Grade History course in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his reply which is welcome. However, if press reports are correct about the GCSE and the national curriculum--neither of which applies in Scotland--will a child have to be at school in Scotland to learn about the Battle of Hastings, kings and queens, Wellington and Nelson? That, of course, would be in addition to Bannockburn and Prestonpans.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, I am confident that the noble Lord will understand why I excuse myself from commenting on the veracity of press reports.

With the curriculum reforms which are proposed at present by the Government, the Battle of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Hastings can be studied at four different levels in secondary schools. That also applies to the Battle of Bannockburn which my noble friend mentioned.

<A NAME="60708-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that he is suggesting that Scottish children should be educated much better than English children? There is a move on the part of persons responsible for the national curriculum in history to minimise the teaching of proper political and institutional history in favour of vague nonsense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, as I understand the situation in England and Wales, a mandatory list of events and peoples is not entirely necessary on its own. The teaching of mandatory subjects such as the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars will include such famous people as Nelson and Wellington. In addition, the subject of the Crown and Parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries will mention the Gunpowder Plot.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, history is a subject on which everyone has his own opinion as to whether it is correct or incorrect. When I saw the Question, I did not know what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, was seeking. I spoke to some people in Scotland who are involved with history and they were just as puzzled. However, it came to me that the thread between social and political Scottish and English history is very tangled in our country. Many Members here will remember with affection Lady Elliot of Harwood who encapsulated a great deal of history. She once told me how proud she was that her father had been carried on the shoulders of his father to the first Chartist demonstration in Britain held in Glasgow Green in 1832. That showed the generations, the movement of people and the public expression of a point of view by someone whom most people in the House will remember with great affection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Courtown: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, for giving me a history lesson. What he said was important: as well as learning about individuals and events of significance, it is also necessary for young people to be aware of important changes within society and consider them across a wide timescale.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, if we are to insist that children learn about battles, will the Minister ensure that Scottish and English children learn as much about the Battle of Stirling Bridge as Bannockburn, bearing in mind that William Wallace was an extremely good commander for the Scots? In teaching about the Battle of Waterloo, perhaps it could be pointed out that two-thirds of Wellington's army consisted of German and Dutch troops and only one-third of English, Scots and Irish.

<P>
<P>

I replied in the negative. Estonia is a free and independent state. Does the Minister agree that British history should be taught in schools in a European context rather than a narrow parochial one?

<FONT SIZE=3>Canterbury for looking after the Bill in another place. I also thank those Members of the House who have shown an interest in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para1"></a>Your Lordships will remember that I find myself in the strange position of looking after a piece of legislation which will have no effect upon the Church of England but which will be warmly welcomed by Roman Catholic and Free Churches in this country. When in force, it will allow for alternative forms of the prescribed words that are used in marriage ceremonies. As a result of recent liturgical revision, the present form of words as required by law for the oaths and declarations do not sit happily within celebrations of holy matrimony within the churches affected. That is those other than the Church of England, the Jewish community or the Society of Friends.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para2"></a>It should be borne in mind that in addition, although the primary purpose of the Bill is to permit alternative words in a marriage service solemnised in a church, it will also enable the new alternative words to be used in a marriage in a register office and certain other forms of civil ceremony, including marriages in approved premises under the Marriage Act 1994.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para3"></a>In introducing the Second Reading, I said that it was very much a tidying up operation. Having debated some of the problems that marriages face in today's society during the Committee stage of the Bill and having, I trust, reassured the noble Lords who contributed to that debate that the Churches share in the concerns that were expressed, I now hope that the House will give its final approval to the Bill. In doing so, we will have tidied up something which is on the one hand minor but in the context of a ceremony as important as marriage an irritating anachronism. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 97, line 4, at beginning insert--
<BR>
("Subject to section (Allocations to homeless persons),").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the main push of today's debate is on Parts VI and VII of the Housing Bill, whose purpose is to ensure that families are housed in permanent council housing only from the waiting list. Homeless families, in other words, may not queue jump but, like everyone else, must wait their turn on the list. While they wait, the local authority has a duty, lasting two years, to find them temporary housing either in <P>


<a name="column_13"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>private rented stock or in the local authority's own temporary stock such as hard-to-let housing. The Government hope that by the end of those two years the vast majority of homeless families will have gained enough points to reach the head of the queue and be rehoused. The Government have accepted that if they have not reached the head of the queue local authorities can continue to help them if they wish, but not, so far, in their own temporary housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para10"></a>The problem is that many local authorities no longer have enough council housing left in which to house most people off the waiting list within two years, let alone house homeless families. It will probably be possible in the north of England, but in London and the South, and in rural districts, there is a limited supply of social housing to rent. For those families that are hard to house because they have special needs--they may be a large family or have a disabled member--the wait is likely to be much longer than the two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para11"></a>What, then, would a homeless family in temporary accommodation for two years do in the meanwhile? If a family is on the waiting list but not homeless, that family can continue to wait. They may be in insecure housing sharing with family or friends, husband, wife and child all in an eight-foot bedroom; they may be in a shabby but expensive rented flat where housing benefit does not cover the rent; they may live in a house that is in a state of poor repair; given their physical health, they may be ill-suited to the house they are in (for instance they cannot climb stairs and the only bathroom is upstairs); they may have only two bedrooms and be somewhat overcrowded with the mother and daughters in one bedroom and the father and sons in another. But however inadequate, unsatisfactory and undesirable all those housing circumstances are, at least the family have a roof over their heads. Such families make up the majority of those on the waiting list. They can usually hold on with their fingernails--just--until the points system or the waiting list itself takes them to the head of the list and they are rehoused into adequate, decent and affordable permanent housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para12"></a>But if people are homeless they cannot wait. They cannot hold out. Family relations may have broken down; the landlord may have evicted them because housing benefit does not cover the rent and they cannot make up the shortfall; the house may be so damp that the children are in and out of hospital with asthma; or the strain of overcrowding may have led to domestic violence and the family has broken up. Homeless families are not different from those on the waiting list, except in so far as their need was more severe in the first place and their ability to hold on and wait is that much less.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para13"></a>As the Department of the Environment so rightly said not very long ago, in 1989:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in many local authorities, those who are homeless are simply people on the waiting list with nowhere to wait". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
They are people on the waiting list with nowhere to wait. That is not my phrase but that of the Department of the Environment; it is the Government's phrase.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para14"></a>This amendment respects that view of the Department of the Environment and also respects the assumption that has informed this Government Bill that, within two <P>


<a name="column_14"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years, the vast majority of homeless families who have been put on the waiting list will indeed be housed. The amendment says that when a local authority receives an application from a homeless family it must consider whether, as with other candidates on the waiting list, that family may be expected to be rehoused within the two years of the local authority's temporary duty towards them and, if the needs of that family are so acute relative to those of other applicants, whether it is reasonable to give them additional points, additional priority, to ensure that they are housed within two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para15"></a>In other words, if what the Government believe is right, as I hope it is, this amendment should not be necessary. But for the tiny minority of homeless families on the waiting list, either in areas where there is a limited or very short supply of social rented housing, as in the inner cities, in the South and in rural districts, or for those families who have difficulty in finding housing because they have special needs--for instance, large families, families with a disabled member--this amendment is their safeguard. Local authorities would not be required to give homeless families additional preference. However, this amendment would mean that, when examining a family's needs relative to those of other people, an authority must consider whether it should ensure that they are housed within the two years or by some other specified time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-04_para16"></a>If the Government are right, and the majority of homeless families will be housed within two years, the amendment need apply only to a very small minority of families: those who live where social housing is in very short supply or where they have special and particular needs. But it does ensure that the needs of those families are not lost sight of and that the local authority may have the discretion to ensure that they are housed within two years. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60708-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I have put my name to this amendment and to Amendment No. 74. My noble friend Lord Russell has just handed me a newspaper cutting. Although noble Lords are accustomed to saying that one cannot believe all one reads in the newspapers, this short report perhaps says more than I could about the situation to which the noble Baroness referred. It is a report from December 1995 concerning an order against the London Borough of Lambeth, which was told,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to pay &#163;6,000 compensation to a homeless family with seven children who were moved 34 times before the council finally found them a permanent home after a wait of more than five years. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Between June 1989 and September 1994, the family lived in bed-and-breakfast accommodation at 34 hotels in eight London boroughs ... Save for short periods, the children received no formal education during that period". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The local government ombudsman, referring to the loss of education, said that he viewed the position of the children as they moved around London "very seriously". The ombudsman said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It cannot be any surprise that problems arose when so many children were crammed into bed-and-breakfast accommodation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The borough was ordered to set aside several thousand pounds to pay for remedial education for those children.

<A NAME = "60708-04_para17"></a>As I said, one sometimes takes with a pinch of salt what one reads in the newspapers. I hope that a situation such as this is worth reporting for its scarcity value. However, this is an extreme example of the very difficult situation to which the noble Baroness referred. It is the reason I join the noble Baroness in asking your Lordships to question very seriously the change in the method of dealing with permanent accommodation proposed by the Government in the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I oppose these amendments on the ground that I do not believe they are necessary; also, Amendment No. 74 would place very heavy demands on local authorities. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, quoted a newspaper report from 1995. I hope the case it referred to is very rare. I hope that the case I read in the local paper, the Hampstead & Highgate Express, on 21st June is equally rare. It related to a couple who claimed that they and their six children were homeless and applied to Camden Council. The report is quite lengthy and I shall not read it all. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At a second meeting with the council ... they brought with them a man who said he was Mr Hai's cousin. He ... pleaded with the council to find the Hais a home quickly, because he said both he and their family were terribly crowded". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In August they were offered temporary accommodation, which they refused, saying they would wait for a house of their own. They wanted one of the very few four-bedroomed homes that Camden Council has, and they said how hard the situation was with their six children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para0"></a>Alarm bells began ringing when the council contacted the schools that the children were supposedly attending, and there was no record of the children. The council then started to look much more carefully into the case, and it uncovered the fact that this couple had just bought two houses for themselves and were about to buy a third; Mr. Hai was a director of a company registered at Companies House; and only four children were traced. Four children had been born to the couple, but were not necessarily with them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para1"></a>Apparently the maximum fine was &#163;2,500 for this attempt to defraud the council. When the case went to court the defence's case was that they had been abroad for many years--they had lived in Saudi Arabia for 17 years--and were not familiar with the procedures for claiming council housing, which is the sort of plea I have heard here often. The judge dismissed the defence's case and said that it was not ignorance, but fraud and a pack of lies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para2"></a>I hope that case is equally as rare as the one that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has just quoted. So many homeless families are genuine cases, and if they are genuine I believe that they will accumulate the necessary number of points within the appropriate time. I believe two years is a good long time. It has been conceded here that during that time most of these people will have been rehoused. The fact that the family quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, had seven children meant that it was a particularly difficult case. <P>


<a name="column_16"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I do not know anything about Lambeth Council's housing stock, but any family with such a large number of children does present a difficult case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para3"></a>I cannot accept the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that these people have nowhere to wait, because they are offered temporary accommodation, and they do have somewhere to live. No one is left without a roof over their heads. I think these amendments are too onerous on the local authorities, and I would oppose them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </B>   My Lords, I would like to agree with every word that my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes has said. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will know from our little debate at Committee stage, I feel equally strongly on this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para4"></a>There is one point which I would like to pick up, and on which I suspect the noble Baroness is between a rock and a hard place, or so it appears to me. One does not want to appear heartless as far as "homeless" people are concerned, but the noble Baroness went through a list of categories of people who were waiting for housing, who were waiting in hopelessly inadequate housing, often in misery, often in intolerable circumstances, but who had been on the waiting list longer than those "homeless" people may have been. But, as my noble friend said, such people had had housing over that two-year period; they had had a period of respite; and they had had a period of trying to get things together.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para5"></a>I sympathise with the noble Baroness on that point, and I suspect that her real difficulty is that she really wants to say that there is not enough social housing, and she wants to be able to house everybody in this social housing, but she cannot say that because she would be committing her party to a good deal of expenditure that it would not wish to own up to in this place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para6"></a>Therefore, I would urge my noble friends to resist both these amendments, the second one not least of all because I think it is possibly incapable of interpretation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene purely to suggest that I suspect the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, has misinterpreted the Government's plans. I think we need to recognise that we are not talking about a situation now, but a situation that will pertain in approximately two years' time, when this Housing Bill has become an Act and is on the statute book. I believe I heard her correctly when she said that after two years nobody would be thrown on to the streets. Maybe I misheard her. The noble Baroness indicates, from a sedentary position, that that is not what she meant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para7"></a>It is worth the House recognising that we are, as I understand the Bill in front of us, talking about a situation where a local authority will have a responsibility to ensure that homeless people are housed for a period of two years, but when that two-year period is finished then the local authority will, almost by law, be required to evict that family from any local authority accommodation, because it will cease to have a legal authority on which to house them.
<P>


<a name="column_17"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 17</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para8"></a>In that situation we could, in two years' time, literally see homeless people being thrown out of whatever poor accommodation they have on to the streets. If my interpretation of the legislation is at fault, then no doubt the Minister, when he comes to wind up this debate, will correct me, but many of us on this side of the House, fear that that is the sort of problem with which we will be faced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to say that the noble Lord has not misunderstood me. I am well aware that the accommodation is for two years. The point I made was that the vast majority of people are housed within those two years. We have, on previous stages of this Bill, had a discussion on the fact that the council would have a certain flexibility if people had reached almost enough points to be eligible to be rehoused. We have had discussion on those points before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-05_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I do not share the noble Baroness's confidence that everybody gets housed within two years. Even if there were only a few people who did not get housed within two years, those people would have a need which deserved attention. I have listened to the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, who was repeating what has been, in essence, the Government's argument on this ever since the Green Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para9"></a>In effect, the Government argue that homelessness allows people to jump the queue. We do not accept that that is the case, but at least we understand the argument. This Bill has now thrown out the baby with the bathwater. It has gone to the other extreme, and it has not allowed homelessness to count for any points at all in local authority allocation schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para10"></a>Allocation schemes should be on the basis of need. I think we would agree with that in all quarters of the House. We are saying that homelessness is one of the forms of housing need. That is the point that this amendment is designed to establish.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, may remember that I responded to her also in Committee and alleged that this Bill was setting up the system of a revolving door, whereby people go into temporary accommodation, do not get rehoused, become homeless again, go into bed and breakfast, and go round the cycle of temporary accommodation all over again. My noble friend Lady Hamwee offered what I believe is a fairly dramatic example of that, but there are plenty of others. In the research published by Shelter this morning there are numerous cases of this kind of thing happening, although not on such a dramatic scale. Under the existing system people are being moved two, three, four, five and six times in the course of their period of homelessness. The situation will, of course, get worse as the January changes in housing benefit begin to bite. As those changes, in their turn, are followed up by the changes in housing benefit for the under-25s, which the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, I am sure will remember debating with some vigour on both sides of this Chamber, I think this revolving door situation will become worse. It has a very considerable effect as regards interrupting children's education.
<P>


<a name="column_18"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para12"></a>In the case which my noble friend quoted just now, the children have had no regular education in five years. The damages award made by the local government ombudsman was in order to meet the cost of remedial classes to make up for lost schooling. That is a very considerable cost to public funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para13"></a>We on this side of the House believe that the Government are not nearly careful enough of public funds. This attempt to palm off the homeless on to the private sector, where the average cost of housing benefit will be &#163;118 million a year greater, is a very good example. Average rents in the private sector are &#163;60 a week as against &#163;38 a week in the local authority sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-05_para14"></a>What the Government are doing is a very considerable waste of money. People do not have to be housed within their particular local authority district, which means that they cannot take regular jobs--they do not know whether they will be able to get to them. That is one of the biggest ways in which the government system is wasting money. If just a few people can be put through into permanent housing in an area where they can work and where their children can go to school, so that they can start a constructive cycle going again, we shall be very much better off. That is what this amendment would achieve and that is why I hope that the House will view it with sympathy.

<A NAME="60708-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, if it were not possibly insulting to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, I would say from these Benches that we--as I am sure is the case with the whole House--are delighted to see the noble Earl return. We are also delighted to have the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, with us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-06_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, that was an enormously gracious remark of the noble Baroness. I dare say she is delighted to see me back because she believes that she will get an easier ride than she had with my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para0"></a>Housing is always a very sensitive issue, as is homelessness. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, said that we hoped everyone would be housed within two years. He also said that homelessness is one of the forms of housing need.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para1"></a>Let me put this point to him. Homelessness is a fact. If a person is homeless, it is a fact. We have tried to address the causes of homelessness. There could be many different reasons why people are homeless. It may well be that a person is not homeless for any length of time, but only homeless for a relatively short time. But when people are homeless, there is a reason for it. That is why we address the causes in Clause 157.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para2"></a>The purpose of all our reforms is to ensure that the claims of everyone who is seeking social housing are given proper consideration on a comparable basis. That is what the allocation provisions in Part VI of the Bill set out to do. We are considerably modernising the factors--it might frighten some of your Lordships--which local authorities should be required to take into account, because some of them have been in operation since 1935. We are doing so in order that they should reflect both long-term social needs and the present housing circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para3"></a>We are also maintaining a proper safety net for families and vulnerable people who lose their present accommodation through no fault of their own. That is what Part VII of the Bill provides for.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para4"></a>Part VII, which deals with the homelessness provisions, preserves the essential structure of the current homelessness legislation. It provides that, where a person is losing his existing accommodation and there is no suitable alternative available to him, the local authority must secure that accommodation is available to him for a minimum of two years. That period can be further extended, at the discretion of the authority or on re-application by the individual, if he continues to qualify.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para5"></a>Under the existing legislation, and the way in which it has been applied until now, a person who is owed a duty under the homelessness legislation has generally been rehoused in long-term accommodation in a little over half the time in which someone who is on the waiting list has had to wait. Those people have been put in long-term accommodation within eight months, whereas those who are on the waiting list have had to wait for 14 months. That is the result of a survey conducted by my own department.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, thought that the Housing Bill would allow local authorities to evict people from their own accommodation. The noble Lord is a charming Member of your Lordships' House but sometimes he gets the wrong end of the stick. He has done so on this occasion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-06_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord cannot rise to his feet yet because I have not answered his question. I shall do so in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para7"></a>The two-year duty to house will recur if the household applies and if the person remains eligible. The local authority will have the power to continue to <P>


<a name="column_20"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accommodate such people for longer than two years. I hope that that satisfies the noble Lord. The noble Baroness wags her head, but she often does that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. He will recognise that there is a difference between the local authority having a duty to provide housing or ensure that people are housed for that two-year period and the responsibilities that they may have beyond those two years. The concern of a number of noble Lords on this side of the House, on an authoritative reading of the Bill, is that if local authorities are providing temporary housing for homeless people during that period, they will, at the end of the two years, effectively be debarred from providing housing for homeless people. By law, they will have to evict any temporarily housed persons whom they have under that category. That is our desperate fear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-06_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I was trying to persuade the noble Lord that his fears were groundless. If I may say so, the noble Baroness is putting me off a little because she wags her head in dissent even before I have said anything.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para8"></a>The fact is that the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, is perfectly right. When a person is homeless, the local authority is bound to provide accommodation for him. His case is assessed. It may be that he is given short-term housing. That can last up to two years. At the end of that two-year period, he can apply again if he has not already found other accommodation. That should not be confused with the two in three-year rule to which we shall come later. The local authority will still have a duty to house that person if he has not already found accommodation or, in other words, if he becomes homeless again. We find from research which has been conducted by the local authority associations that, in the great majority of authorities, those who are owed a duty under the homelessness legislation are rehoused more quickly than those who are on the waiting list. I ask whether that is fair. I take the example of the young girl with a baby who lives in bad and miserable conditions. The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, shakes his head. I congratulate him on his percipience. In fact, he does not know what I am going to say, but he disagrees with me before I say it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para9"></a>For example, there may be a young lady with a baby living in poor circumstances--bad housing with water running down the walls and so forth; she is on the housing list. There may be another young lady who is expecting a baby but in more convenient circumstances, possibly even comfortable circumstances. However, her mother gets cross with her because she is having a baby and says that she must leave. At the moment that young lady can go to the housing authority and say, "I am being made homeless". She is immediately put on the homeless list and jumps the queue ahead of the girl who lives in far worse circumstances. Which is the more deserving case? Is it the one being made homeless because the mother does not approve of her having a <P>


<a name="column_21"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 21</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>baby even though she may be living in good conditions, or the one living in bad conditions, sitting on the waiting list waiting to be rehoused?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-06_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for allowing me to intervene. Does the noble Earl understand that what he describes is not what the amendment proposes? The amendment proposes that local authorities should be able to balance one form of need against the other as seems to them appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-06_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am coming to that. I was trying to give the noble Earl the picture in case he was not certain what it was. However, he and the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, appear to be certain.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para10"></a>What has happened under the existing legislation is that homelessness has become a short-cut into long-term social housing and somebody who loses his present home can, if he is in priority need, simply require the local authority to rehouse him without taking any steps to avert the crisis or seek an alternative. We are providing that the homelessness duty is to secure accommodation for a minimum of two years. Research shows that over three-quarters of all people who are allocated council housing are rehoused within that period. Not everyone who is accepted for rehousing under the homelessness legislation wants permanent housing. A separate study carried out by my department showed that some 18 per cent. of those accepted for rehousing under the homelessness legislation had found other accommodation for themselves in a little over one year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para11"></a>During our consideration of these provisions we heard a great many complaints about people who are owed a duty under the homelessness legislation being accommodated in unsatisfactory accommodation, or being required to move from one short-term letting to another. I should like to be able to reassure your Lordships on both counts. The accommodation which the local authority is required to secure under the new two-year duty must be "suitable"; we will return to that concept later. It is sufficient to say now that poor quality accommodation will not be acceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para12"></a>Concern was also expressed that local authorities may not be able to find sufficient stock in the private rented sector for the discharge of the two-year duty. It was in recognition of that concern that, when the Bill was being considered in Committee in another place, my honourable friend the Minister for Housing announced that we would consider a revision of the arrangements which govern the leasing of private rented stock by local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para13"></a>I can confirm that, from 1st April 1997, local authorities will be able to take out leases for up to 10 years on property owned by private landlords in order to provide accommodation for those who are owed a duty under the homelessness legislation without being required to provide capital cover. There will be no restriction on their taking out further leases on property which had been the subject of an earlier lease. Those measures will ensure that local authorities have the <P>


<a name="column_22"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 22</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ability to provide suitable and stable accommodation for all those to whom they owe a duty under the homelessness legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para14"></a>The noble Baroness's amendment seeks, possibly unintentionally, to continue to make the homelessness legislation a direct route into long-term social housing. That is not what we wish to do. The noble Baronesses, Lady Hollis and Lady Hamwee, ask that local authorities be required to assess whether a household which has been accommodated for two years under the homelessness provisions should be offered accommodation through the allocation scheme within two years. If not, they propose that the local authority be required to assess whether the housing needs of that particular household are greater than others on the register. If that is the case, the authority would be required to give that household additional preference with a view to ensuring that it obtains permanent accommodation within two years of its first being owed a duty under the homelessness legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para15"></a>There are technical reasons--and more substantive ones--why the amendment is not acceptable. At a technical level, I do not see how an authority can compare the housing needs of people who are on the housing register, which will include the person who is owed the homelessness duty, and on the same basis and, at the same time, make a separate assessment under the proposed provisions in the new clause of the housing needs of the person who is owed the homelessness duty. The noble Baronesses are mistaken in suggesting that the application of the new clause should run for two years from the time at which accommodation is provided as a result of the duty under Clause 183. The authority may seek to maintain the person who is threatened with homelessness in his present accommodation either for a few more months or, in some cases, indefinitely.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para16"></a>Therefore the requirements imposed by the clause could continue to be in place almost indefinitely. The real point is that the noble Baronesses are seeking to ensure that, once a family has been accepted for rehousing under the homelessness legislation, it should--even after it has been accommodated for two years and even if it is no longer in priority need--still be entitled to a degree of preference over others who may be living in wholly unsatisfactory accommodation but who are patiently waiting their turn on the housing list. The family who would gain will have been provided with perfectly reasonable accommodation for two years. The family who would lose could be living in damp conditions with poor sanitation and with no prospect of improving those conditions except through an offer of a tenancy through the housing register.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para17"></a>Social housing is intended for people with real long-term needs. It is generally taken up by people who cannot secure accommodation for themselves in the housing market in a way in which the majority of the population can. I suggest that it is wrong to suppose that social housing should go to people who could provide for themselves in other ways. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said that the homeless family cannot wait, while those on the waiting list can; its need is more urgent.
<P>


<a name="column_23"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para18"></a>The noble Baroness misses the point. The family accepted as homeless is given suitable accommodation for two years and families on the waiting list may be in much worse accommodation. I am sure your Lordships agree that they are the ones to be given priority. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to a family which had been moved 34 times. I agree that that is a distressing case and is unacceptable. Indeed, the homelessness code of guidance already states that and it is precisely to avoid such situations that we are giving the authorities a two-year duty to provide suitable housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para19"></a>Clause 157 requires local authorities to adopt a broad set of allocation criteria which will ensure that everyone with long-term housing needs receives fair consideration for the available stock of housing. If households who are owed a duty under the homelessness legislation have long-term needs which are greater than those of others who are on the housing register--and many of them will have--they can be confident that they will be offered permanent social housing through the register.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para20"></a>Homelessness is of course regrettable. However, it is a fact and not a cause. We want to address the causes which lead to people becoming homeless. When we have done that, we can right the situation. Those who are homeless will receive accommodation, but it should not be a short-cut to advancing in front of those already on the housing register. It is for that reason that I hope your Lordships will not agree to the amendment.

<A NAME="60708-06_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, when I came to reply I intended to welcome back the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, and say, like her, that we on these Benches are delighted to see him. However, after his assurance that he would be no more accommodating than his noble friend and after the answer that he has just given, I am sure he will understand if our delight has been just a little qualified. Nevertheless, we are delighted to see him in his place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para21"></a>Perhaps I may use the shorthand used by the noble Earl and the two noble Baronesses, Lady Gardner of Parkes and Lady Oppenheim-Barnes. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, pointed out a case of fraud, and she was right to do so. I am sure and I would expect that anyone from these Benches and of our political persuasion running a local authority where such a case was presented to them would respond in exactly the same way as the noble Baroness did. I have no more tolerance or patience with fraud or with anyone manipulating the system in a wilful and wrongful way than she has. There is nothing between us on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para22"></a>She went on to say--and this is at the heart of the amendment, and I believe I have her words correctly--that if there are genuine cases she expects that they will accumulate the necessary points within two years. I wish that she were right. If she were right this amendment would be unnecessary. It is precisely because, for quite a small number of people, she is not correct that we need this amendment as a safety net. That is my best <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>information. For example, I am told that at present in Tower Hamlets there are more than 50 families who have been waiting for more than two years for appropriate council housing, having been accepted as homeless and placed in temporary accommodation, including bed and breakfast.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-06_para23"></a>On the argument put forward by the noble Baroness, if she were presented with that information I am sure that she would wish to support this amendment. I agree that genuine applicants should be housed within the two years and should be allowed to acquire the necessary points to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I ask the leave of the House to intervene. I draw the attention of the noble Baroness again to the point that has been brought out in earlier debates; namely, that in certain large cities and inner London in particular there are particular difficulties, but those difficulties are not typical of everywhere. I believe that the Government are well aware of the particular need in the inner city areas, and that might have to be dealt with differently. That does not mean that the provision will apply everywhere else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is absolutely right. This amendment would not need to apply, I hope, to most parts of the country. But there are places, which I was at pains to point out, where the pressures are so acute that this situation will arise. As the noble Baroness said, they include the inner London boroughs and many places in the south, including the coastal towns and some rural districts. Those are places where applicants have special needs for large accommodation. We have discussed this before. There may be two step-families coming together or a member of the family may be disabled. From what the noble Baroness has suggested, in those situations she will be asking her noble friends on the Front Bench to modify their approach. That will be no more and no less than this amendment does.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I ask the leave of the House once again to intervene. I had asked my noble friends to allow a period of two years, in those exceptional circumstances, to be extended to perhaps three years, but not in the way proposed in this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, in that case I look forward to the support of the noble Baroness on an amendment later this afternoon which will do exactly that. I believe that we are using the same hymn sheet, but possibly different parts of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para0"></a>Perhaps I may now comment on the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes. I agree with her on the first point, but perhaps not on the second. The substantive point on which she is right is that the problem originates from the fact that there is a shortage of social housing to rent. That is why there is pressure. At this stage your Lordships will not particularly welcome a debate as to why there is that pressure, but it is certainly due to the fact that local authorities have <P>


<a name="column_25"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been unable to recycle their capital receipts. Therefore, to replace the houses which have been sold there has been growing pressure on rented social housing. It is that problem that we are seeking to address. The point on which I disagree with the noble Baroness is that it is obviously true that many people on the waiting list are living in miserable conditions. But the fact that they do not become homeless means that their situation is usually not as intolerable as that of people who are homeless.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para1"></a>From my experience of chairing a housing committee for 11 years, for the most part the difference, as the DoE said in 1989, between families on the waiting list and those who become homeless is that the homeless cannot wait. That was my experience from local authority work and that was confirmed by the Government in 1989.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para2"></a>I now come to the Minister's point. He described this Bill as offering a safety net for homeless families. I believe that his advisers have failed to engage with what this amendment does. I say categorically that it does not do what the Minister asserted, which, according to his phrase, allows homeless families a direct route into permanent housing. It does not do that. I am genuinely distressed that his advisers thought fit to put that interpretation on the amendment. I do not know whether our amendment was so opaque, but the Minister said that is what it did.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para3"></a>Those who have been involved in these debates for many hours will know that that is not what this amendment does. It does not give homeless families a direct route into permanent housing. Under this Bill homeless families go into temporary housing for a statutory period of two years. The question which this amendment seeks to deal with--and I apologise to the House for perhaps not making this as clear as I should have done at the beginning--is what happens to these homeless families if, after two years in temporary accommodation, they have not got to the head of the queue. My noble friend Lord Monkswell is right in saying that that is the question.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para4"></a>As the Bill stands a local authority may continue to rehouse them after two years: the word is "may" and not "must". If the local authority decides not to continue to house them then the family is out. However, if in the process of housing them for two years the local authority has used its own hard-to-let housing, they have to be evicted. The Minister said that that was wrong, but he simply misunderstood my noble friend and that is why I shook my head. I was respecting the conventions at Report stage so I did not intervene during his speech, but perhaps another time I should do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para5"></a>The Minister has misunderstood this amendment. It does not give a direct route for homeless families into permanent housing. It states that if after two years a tiny minority of families who have been in temporary housing have not reached the head of the queue and otherwise face eviction--which must take place if they are living in local authority owned property--then this amendment allows local authorities to review all the circumstances. If it thinks it reasonable, the local authority should ensure that the family is given enough points to be rehoused into permanent housing. There is <P>


<a name="column_26"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>no direct route or queue jumping. They wait two years. If the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, is right--and I hope she is--most of the families will have their needs met within those two years, but some will not.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para6"></a>Rented social housing is in very short supply in the inner London boroughs, as the noble Baroness suggested, and in other areas, as the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, pointed out in an earlier debate. He referred to families being hard to house because, for example, a member of the family may be disabled and need a large property. Those families may face eviction from temporary housing after two years and if they are living in a local authority owned house they must be evicted. Is that reasonable? Is it right to send fragile, vulnerable families, often with several children, into the churning of going in and out of temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfast accommodation, hotel or private rented accommodation and so on? It is not that they queue jump or that there is a direct route into permanent housing but merely, as the Minister himself said, that there should be a safety net for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para7"></a>However, if after two years a family in temporary housing has not qualified for permanent housing, then the local authority may, if it believes it reasonable, in comparison with other people on the list, ensure that they have enough points to qualify for permanent housing, which they would get if they lived in a different authority area. That is all this amendment does. It simply does what the Minister said it should do, which is to put in a safety net. If we do not there remains a black hole for some of the most vulnerable and fragile families.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-07_para8"></a>It is a modest amendment. It will probably affect only a few thousand out of the 120,000 homeless families who present themselves to local authorities each year. But those families are in an acute situation. They are not queue jumping. The amendment merely provides that after two years' waiting, in often poor quality temporary housing, we should not send them churning back into bed and breakfast accommodation to go through the cycle again. Remembering that this is not providing a direct route into permanent housing and it is not queue-jumping--it is merely including a means of rescue and a safety net for those who would otherwise be turned out after a wait of two years--I should like to test the opinion of the House on the amendment.

<A NAME = "60708-08_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 2, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 7, 9, 10, 12 and 14.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para1"></a>Perhaps I may echo the noble Baroness and welcome my noble friend Lord Ferrers back to the House. I do so with a great deal of relief but, unfortunately, almost immediately I have to return to your Lordships because this part of the Bill affects part of the Government's policy on asylum seekers and the tie-in with the changes which we have made to benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para2"></a>I have told the House, on what must be beginning to feel like an excessive number of previous occasions, that the Government are clear that social housing, which is intended to meet the ongoing needs of people who require low-cost affordable housing over the long term, should not be used to accommodate people who may be here for only a short time. We intend to ensure that persons who are subject to immigration control do not have access to long-term tenancies allocated by a local housing authority unless they have the right to remain here indefinitely and the right to receive public funds.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para3"></a>As drafted, Clause 153 provides the Secretary of State with the power to prescribe by regulations classes of persons who are or are not qualified to be allocated housing by a local authority. In practical terms, this means that any exclusion from entitlement to be allocated a social tenancy would be achieved by subordinate legislation: in other words, by regulation. Your Lordships will be aware that the Court of Appeal on 21st June, in reviewing the lawfulness of the Social Security (Persons From Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996, has recently expressed concern about the vires of subordinate legislation which excludes certain asylum seekers from entitlement to non-contributory social security benefits such as income support and housing benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para4"></a>As your Lordships will recall, in the light of that court judgment we have recently amended Clause 9 of the Asylum and Immigration Bill, which deals with the housing entitlement of persons subject to immigration control. The effect of those amendments was to make clear on the face of that Bill that persons who are subject to immigration control are not entitled either to be allocated a council tenancy or to assistance under the homelessness legislation, unless they fall within a class of person prescribed by regulations. That puts beyond doubt, in primary legislation, that such persons do not have an entitlement unless they are prescribed as so having. Your Lordships will not be surprised to hear that we wish to make similar amendments to this Bill in respect of persons who are not qualifying persons for the purposes of allocating tenancies under Part VI and also in respect of persons who are not entitled to assistance under Part VII. I shall deal with that part later when we come to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para5"></a>Amendment No. 7 will achieve that end by providing that all persons subject to immigration control will be ineligible to be allocated a social tenancy by a local housing authority unless they were to fall into a class of person prescribed by regulations as being qualified. Notwithstanding the issue of vires and lawfulness, the practical effect of this amendment is nil. We are in the same position as we were with the original clause. The classes of persons we intend to exclude from entitlement to be allocated a tenancy by a local housing authority are not changed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para6"></a>Under Clause 153 as drafted, we would prescribe by regulations those classes of person subject to immigration control which are excluded from entitlement. Under the clause as it would be changed by these amendments, we would prescribe by regulations those classes which are entitled. We intend that an order under Clause 153(1A) would specify that the following classes of person, subject to immigration control, are qualifying persons in relation to local housing authorities. They are, first, refugees; secondly, persons granted exceptional leave to remain; and, thirdly, persons having indefinite leave to remain. We intend that such regulations would be made at the outset on commencement so that Amendment No. 7 would put beyond doubt the lawfulness of excluding certain classes of person subject to immigration control from <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>entitlement to be allocated a local authority tenancy. Amendments Nos. 9, 12 and 14 are drafting amendments consequential upon that amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para7"></a>Amendment No. 10 would clarify that regulations made under Clause 153(2) may prescribe classes of person who are or are not qualifying persons in respect of either an individual authority or in respect of local housing authorities generally. We have been over this argument on a fair number of occasions before, and I commend these amendments to your Lordships.

<A NAME="60708-08_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, yesterday a number of your Lordships probably had rather more leisure than I had for applauding the exploits of Richard Krajicek at Wimbledon. The few moments that I was able to watch, in the time I could take off from considering this Bill, were well worth it. It was a clear reminder of how much a country may gain in credit and reputation from what is done by those who come to it as refugees. If his parents had come to this country now, I believe he would never have been born; but I will take that matter no further now.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para8"></a>This is a technical amendment. It substitutes the vires of primary legislation for the vires of regulation. That, so far as it goes, is a laudable change, though it will of course take up a certain amount of time in the next Parliament, and that will have to be found. It is wide of the point of the judgment. I understand the Government's caution; if it makes them a little more cautious in future about what they set out to do by regulation, that may be a good thing. The point may arise again when we come to Amendment No. 8 and those amendments which are grouped with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para9"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 97, line 36, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) For the avoidance of doubt, under section 157(2) of this Part the local housing authority may in exceptional circumstances give additional preference to persons to whom the authority are subject to a duty under section 181 of this Act.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I wonder, ever hopeful, whether this amendment might acquire the support of the Government Benches and possibly even of the Government themselves. It refers to the issue of exceptional circumstances. I believe that your Lordships' House is occasionally persuaded by what I would like to think is the stronger argument, and this may be one such case; I do not know. Only those people who are eligible for permanent council housing are those at the top of the waiting list. Most homeless people are on the waiting list in the usual way, living with family or friends, or living in a six-months shelter awaiting their turn. Then arrangements may break down and they become homeless. Sometimes the family becomes homeless shortly before they are due to be rehoused from the waiting list. The Minister made it clear in Committee by repeating the assurances made in another place that the local authorities could, in exceptional circumstances, give additional preference to homeless <P>


<a name="column_31"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people near the top of the waiting list. This amendment seeks to put the Minister's words on to the face of the Bill to avoid doubt.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para11"></a>What the amendment does--and we welcomed the Government's response--is to allow a modest amount of flexibility in the system. Somebody is sharing accommodation and they are on the waiting list, having waited perhaps one year and eleven-and-a-half months or maybe they are two months away from a permanent allocation. Although they are just a very short time away from permanent reallocation their two years is up and they are forced to move into yet another home in the meanwhile. No sooner will they have moved in the furniture, contacted the utilities and changed the address for council tax than out they move again, all at considerable cost and with great stress being caused to the family concerned as well as being destabilising for the children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-08_para12"></a>The Minister could, if he wished, define by guidance the word "exceptional". We pressed him on what this word meant at Committee, but the Minister merely emphasised that, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, "exceptional" meant exceptional and that local authorities had that exceptional discretion. He would not go further. I hope that the Minister would like to see the words he used in Committee immortalised on the face of the Bill: I am sure that local authorities would. It is the aim of this amendment that, as the Minister has said, local authorities may in exceptional circumstances, such as the one I have envisaged, rehouse a family rather than send them through the process when they only have six weeks, two months or whatever to go. I think that local authorities, to avoid the possibility of litigation, need to have that assurance so that it is not just in the Minister's words printed in Hansard but printed on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. I have sympathy for the Minister who said at the last stage that by definition he could not define "exceptional". I believe that this amendment is an appropriate way to tackle the issue. It is right that the matter should go on the face of the Bill. If the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, now asks the mover of the amendment to define "exceptional", I believe that the noble Baroness is quite right to quote his colleague's words back at him.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-09_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I believe that we badly need this amendment because of the effect of Clause 157(8) of the Bill. That provides that a local authority shall not allocate housing accommodation except in accordance with its allocation scheme. If there is no provision for exceptions the words of Clause 157(8) will prove extremely inconvenient. One does not want a world that is made up of nothing but exceptions. As was said in this House by the first Earl of Strafford, the prerogative is to be used as God doth His omnipotency--upon extraordinary occasions. But there must be prerogative if there must be extraordinary occasions. There are plenty of extraordinary occasions. One can immediately <P>


<a name="column_32"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>think of many categories where, to avoid a considerable degree of social harm, it may be necessary to allow a local authority on occasion to give an additional priority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para0"></a>Take, for example, children leaving care. They are some of the worst treated people in the whole of society. The problems created are likely to be with us for the rest of those people's lives. We are likely to pay heavily for them. There are the problems of those cared for in the community who may be discharged from medical or other accommodation when their needs are exceptional and who are not altogether fit to cope with the housing market. I take as an example a person who regularly can be seen on the route that I take to the tube station in the morning and who harangues every passer-by with unintelligible imprecations. Such people are not necessarily fit for the amount of freedom they have been given. If there is no exceptional freedom to provide for them tragedies of many kinds may result.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para1"></a>Take the example of women who leave refuges after they have been victims of domestic violence. Ever since publication of the Green Paper there has been intense concern among those involved in refuges about the danger of urgently needed places silting up because people cannot be rehoused. Being able to exercise a reasonable preference in cases like that may be vital to avoid severe problems. People who have been through that experience need a new permanent environment in order to get back on their feet again. To stand on one's own two feet is all very well. But, generally, one needs ground underneath one's feet before one can do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para2"></a>Amendment No. 4 takes its wording from the Children Act. It is my understanding that Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are grouped together. That draws attention to the fact that we are perpetually passing on problems from housing to social services. There must be a two-way traffic; if not, there will be a traffic jam. I am happy to support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-09_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness explained the reasoning behind the amendment, for which I am grateful. I am amused by the company the noble Earl, Lord Russell, keeps when he goes to the tube station every day. I believe that he is very generous to take a person who perpetually harangues everyone in sight--but evidently not the noble Earl, Lord Russell. I presume that if he harangued the noble Earl he would not get a lift the next day.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para3"></a>I should like to address the amendment by explaining what Clause 157 does. It sets out the factors to which each local authority must give reasonable preference in framing its allocation scheme. Those factors take into account a broad range of housing circumstances and social conditions. That is all that the legislation says about the way in which an authority must allocate its stock. It is for each authority to decide the details of the scheme it wishes to adopt for its area, subject to any principles that the Secretary of State may prescribe on matters such as the involvement of elected members in individual cases and how it operates the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para4"></a>This means that the authority has considerable discretion as to how to interpret the factors to which it is required to give reasonable preference. The expression <P>


<a name="column_33"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"reasonable preference" appears in the provisions governing housing allocations contained in the Housing Act 1985. Indeed, the same term is found in earlier legislation dating back to 1935.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para5"></a>The amendment seeks to address the question of what would happen to a household which, for example, had been on the waiting list for some time and was perhaps living in poor conditions. The household might be nearing the point where it would be allocated a house. It may be that a fire occurs, the house is burned down and the household suddenly becomes homeless. The household is rehoused under the new two-year duty, possibly in a house which is in better condition than the one which has been burned down. Because the accommodation provided under the two-year duty must be suitable within the meaning of Clause 192, the household will lose at least some of the points which it had on the waiting list because it had been in poor accommodation. No doubt many of your Lordships will feel that that is unfair since the household will have to wait longer for permanent rehousing than it would have done had the house not burned down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para6"></a>We are not setting out in legislation the way in which an authority will operate its allocation scheme in relation to individual cases. That must be a matter for its discretion. We do not wish to specify how each local authority handles such a case. An authority must apply the principle of reasonable preference in setting up its allocation scheme. Within its scheme, which must reflect the criteria set out in Clause 157(2), it has discretion to make provision for special cases of this kind and to move them directly into permanent housing if it feels that the particular circumstances justify it. Clearly, the authority can use this discretion only within the limits of that which is reasonable in a particular case. But if the Bill were to contain a general provision on this point, it would run counter to the authority's duty to give reasonable preference to the classes of person mentioned in Clause 157. Some local housing authorities already exercise their discretion in particular cases in just this way under present provisions. Since the key phrase in the legislation, "reasonable preference", appears in both the existing and the new legislation I see no reason why authorities should not continue to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para7"></a>I draw the attention of the House to the provision which follows the list of allocation criteria in Clause 157(2):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The scheme shall also be framed so as to secure that additional preference is given to households ... consisting of someone with a particular need for settled accommodation on medical or welfare grounds who cannot reasonably be expected to find settled accommodation for themselves in the foreseeable future". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That would enable an authority to give additional preference to someone with a need for long-term housing on medical and welfare grounds if he could not reasonably be expected to secure accommodation for himself. I believe that that would meet the cases of most concern to your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para8"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness seeks to formalise the extent of a local authority's discretion. That may be a contradiction in terms in that it is quite difficult to formalise a discretion. I believe that that <P>


<a name="column_34"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be a pity. The amendment seeks to set out in specific terms what the Bill already provides for in the construction of Clause 157. So I hope that the noble Baroness will not think I am churlish if I say to her that the Bill would be better without the amendment because that which the noble Baroness wishes to see incorporated in the Bill is, in fact, already incorporated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, before responding to the debate I would like to ask the Minister a question that follows from what he was saying.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para9"></a>One of the issues that I think has not been clarified at any stage during the debates is on what the points system is based. I had assumed from what had been said in the other place and at earlier stages in this Bill by the Minister's noble friend Lord Mackay--but obviously I do not want to put words into his mouth--that the number of points allocated to a homeless person when he went into temporary accommodation depend on the condition of homelessness existing when he went on to the waiting list rather than on the quality of the temporary housing offered to him. In other words, by accepting temporary accommodation, he would go back down the list--the snake effect. If that were so, I can see it would be very difficult for local authorities. Applicants would then say "Well, I don't want good temporary accommodation even for two years if that means that I won't get permanent housing for another four or five. I would rather take my chance in poorer temporary housing and not lose my points score, and then get my entitlement to permanent housing in due course".
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para10"></a>Will the Minister clarify that point which is absolutely pivotal to our understanding? I had understood that the situation from which homeless families came determined their points score: that they waited in temporary accommodation and that whatever the nature of the temporary accommodation it did not affect their points. But something that the Minister said seemed to suggest that the eligibility for permanent housing would depend on the points obtained from the temporary housing in which they were subsequently housed. He used the case of somebody whose house was burnt down. In that case, as I said, there would be major problems for people trying to calculate whether they should accept this temporary house rather than another according to the points it would carry with them for their family. I am sure that that is not a route that local authorities would want to go down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-09_para11"></a>That point is so pivotal that it would be very helpful if we could have an answer. It may be that the Minister would prefer to wait a moment or two and come back with it, but we really do need this clarified. I am happy to wait and go on to some other points if that would help the Minister. It is a major point for us, and I am trespassing on the indulgence of the House.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-10_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for drawing attention to a point which she feels is uncertain. If I made it uncertain for her, I am sorry. The reason for the uncertainty is that I gave the <P>


<a name="column_35"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>example of somebody living in a poor house, who had his house burnt down but, had that not happened he would have been almost at the top of the list. He is then moved temporarily into a bigger house and, as a result, it might be thought that he goes down to the bottom of the list. That is a matter which local authorities will have to decide. The point is perfectly clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para0"></a>This is where we do not want to be confused about homelessness. I shall take the noble Baroness through the steps relatively carefully. A person comes to a local authority and says "I haven't got a house". He is made homeless unintentionally as opposed to a failure to pay the rent. It is then the duty of the local authority to see that that person is housed. If he turns up at nine o'clock at night, he might be sent into a bedsitting room or whatever it may be. The next day the local authority will see the person and ask why he is homeless. The reasons for the homelessness or the reasons for the person being in that position will be discussed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para1"></a>The allocation of points will depend very much on that which is contained in Clause 157 which, as I said when speaking to the first amendment, is really a matter of trying to find the cause of homelessness. It may be that the cause of homelessness is that the wife has walked out or it may be that the house has burnt down. But long-term housing is determined by Clause 157(2) which refers to giving reasonable preference to people occupying insanitary or overcrowded housing, people occupying housing accommodation which is temporary or occupied on insecure terms, families with dependent children, households consisting of or including someone who is expecting a child, and so forth. That is what determines the right of people to long-term housing. The fact that they have been given short-term housing does not put them at an advantage or at a disadvantage over whether they obtain long-term housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para2"></a>I hope that that has made the point relatively clear. The points systems will take account of the level of security of tenure which a person has.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I hope that the Minister will correct me if I have misunderstood him, but I think the Minister said that he used the words local authorities will have to decide. In other words, there is an element of discretion as to the basis upon which the local authorities will determine the points system: either the conditions of homelessness from which the people concerned emerged, or the quality of temporary accommodation which they now occupy. I think that is what the Minister said. If I have misunderstood that, I would be very grateful to be corrected.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para3"></a>He went on to say that temporary accommodation, being insecure, would obviously come into the reasonable preference. But studying my own local authority's points system, insecure accommodation carries only, for example, 10 points whereas medical need may carry 100 points, and shared facilities may carry 100 points. So simply saying that because they are insecure gives them reasonable preference will not <P>


<a name="column_36"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>give them enough points certainly to bring them back up to the level at which they entered the situation of temporary housing because insecure accommodation as such, in the typical local authority points system, does not carry very many points.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para4"></a>I repeat, as I understand it, people may go down the "snake" by going into temporary housing but that is for the local authority to determine. Is that correct? I apologise to your Lordships but it is such a pivotal point that it would be very helpful for all of us to have clarification of that. I am happy to move on and ask the Minister to come back at some appropriate stage because without this clarification, local authorities will not know how they are allocating their points scheme. I am in the Minister's hands. I am very happy to continue or to give way to him if the House will permit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-10_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall try to clarify the point with which the noble Baroness is concerned. If she looks at Clause 157(2) one of the priorities to which preference will have to be given is contained in paragraph (b):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"people occupying housing accommodation which is temporary or occupied on insecure terms". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Therefore in the case which I gave of a person's house which is in a scruffy order being burnt down and that person being put into temporary accommodation because of that, his points allocation would not drop. But I think this is an important point. I would like to write to the noble Baroness because I would not like to mislead her.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, again I thank the Minister for that and therefore I shall now wind up this debate. I am very glad that we have had the opportunity of this exchange. Perhaps it is our fault that we did not seek to have this clarified earlier but I had assumed that people continue to carry their points with them into whatever temporary housing they went. Something that the Minister said alarmed me and suggested a "snake" possibility in which case there are, to change my animal metaphor, elephant traps that we had not even anticipated for local authorities in seeking to manage this legislation. I would be glad if the Minister could write to me as speedily as possible. That would then allow us the opportunity to revisit this issue, if necessary, on Third Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para5"></a>Apart from that, I have very little to say, for which I am sure your Lordships will be duly grateful. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that she could not define "exceptional". The noble Earl, Lord Russell, went on to give several instances of that which illustrated the point very well for us over and beyond the situation in which the person is six weeks' away from being housed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para6"></a>The Minister assures us that this point is well covered already in the Bill. I have to say we do not believe that it is. We would not be moving this amendment if it were. He accepts the principle that local authorities do have the right to exercise their discretion in these exceptional circumstances. He <P>


<a name="column_37"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 37</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believes it is already in the Bill but we do not see it clearly in the Bill--in other words we are now simply talking about drafting. For the avoidance of doubt, I should like to seek to persuade your Lordships that this phrase, from which the Minister does not dissent, should actually be in the Bill so that it is clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-10_para7"></a>If that were clear and in the Bill, our advisers would not be asking us to press the amendment. Therefore, I wish to test the opinion of the House. I do not do that because there is a difference of substance between us and the Minister but there is a difference in relation to how transparent are the Minister's words. He believes that what we want is already there but we cannot see those words in the clause. That is why I wish to press the amendment. There is no disagreement between us as regards the issue but merely about the transparency of what the Government say is the case. I hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister may agree to include the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the avoidance of doubt". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
However, if he is not prepared to do so, I wish to test the opinion of the House.

("( ) The provisions of this part do not apply where the local housing authority consider the welfare of a person within their area is likely to be seriously prejudiced if they do not provide him with settled accommodation.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is another attempt to skin the cat. It is a gentler attempt to skin it, if any skinning of a cat can be gentle. The amendment addresses the issue of exceptional circumstances. I hope that it may appeal to your Lordships as it is an attempt to define a little more precisely a matter which I accept is difficult to define. It constitutes, perhaps, a more lateral approach to the subject. This modest amendment would permit immediate rehousing of people who are not on the register, but only if not to do so would seriously jeopardise their welfare. The provision would be subject to Clause 152(5) which gives the Secretary of State powers to restrict or attach conditions to this paragraph. I say that with some hesitation as the views of these Benches on such powers for the Secretary of State are well known. I hope, however, that there may be a temptation to look favourably on the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para1"></a>The wording of the amendment borrows from that of the Children Act which provides at Section 20(3) that a local authority has to provide accommodation for a child in need who has reached the age of 16 and,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whose welfare the authority consider is likely to be seriously prejudiced if they do not provide him with accommodation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I wonder about the use of that infinitive, but never mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para2"></a>
The amendment would enable local authorities to house a limited number of people--I believe that would include children in need as defined by the Children Act--without subjecting them to the requirements of Part VI.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para3"></a>The Government's consultation paper on housing allocations makes much of local discretion. The amendment is wholly consistent with the paper. It would allow flexibility within the constraints of the requirement for serious prejudice, but it would put on the face of the Bill certain exceptions. Regulations offer flexibility, but, by leaving matters to regulation, local authorities may well find it difficult to plan their provision and to develop the necessary partnerships that are required to provide assistance to certain vulnerable groups. I suggest that certain allocations should be dealt with in the manner proposed in this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para4"></a>On a previous amendment my noble friend gave some examples of people who might be seriously prejudiced without such an obligation. He referred to young people leaving care and those who require community care <P>


<a name="column_40"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services. I would add--my noble friend may have referred to this--women fleeing situations of domestic violence. My noble friend referred to accommodation which is designed to be temporary--and which in the rather ugly phrase we have developed--is "likely to silt up". I am not suggesting that people who fall in the categories that I have mentioned will necessarily be caught by the wording of the amendment. That may be the case, but the criterion will be serious prejudice and not particular circumstances. I hope your Lordships may feel that this is an appropriate matter to be included on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-11_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the noble Baroness is keen to ensure that everything is as right as it should be. She said there was another way of skinning the cat. I wish she would leave the poor pussy alone because it would be much easier if she did. I think the provision is unnecessary because it seeks to achieve, outside the provisions of Part VI, the very things which Part VI is intended to provide. The fundamental purpose of the reforms in this Bill is to ensure that long-term social housing goes to households which have the greatest need. That is the whole principle behind the reforms. The arrangements are designed to give local authorities the direction which is needed to meet housing need, while giving them the ability to frame their allocation schemes in a way which best meets local circumstances. That is exactly what the allocation criteria in Clause 157 are designed to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para5"></a>I tried to explain earlier that the structures of Parts VI and VII of the Bill should, taken together, ensure that the needs of people who are owed a duty under the homelessness legislation are properly addressed, as are the needs of people seeking long-term housing. As I said on an earlier occasion to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, I direct her attention--I also direct the attention of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, to this--to Clause 157(2) at page 100 of the Bill which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The scheme shall also be framed so as to secure that additional preference is given to households within paragraph (e) consisting of someone with a particular need for settled accommodation on medical or welfare grounds who cannot reasonably be expected to find settled accommodation for themselves in the foreseeable future". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is an important criterion. It would require an authority to give additional preference to someone who has a need for long-term accommodation on medical or welfare grounds, if that person could not reasonably be expected to secure that accommodation for himself. That should meet most of the anxieties of the noble Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said that there should be special provision for the welfare of young people. We propose to make regulations under Clause 152(4) which will allow authorities to accept referrals of certain groups, who may include young people, without applying the provisions of Part VI. We are still reflecting on the consultation on the subject which was undertaken in January this year. With those comments, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that, on the whole, we are trying to meet the points which are of reasonable <P>


<a name="column_41"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concern to her. It would be best if the Bill remained as it is without her amendment because, as I have said, we have catered for the anxieties of the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I accept that the Government are trying to ensure that there are no holes. Certainly I am prepared to accept that for the purposes of this debate. My concern is to make sure that there are no holes. To that extent, I am going in the same direction as the Government. In accepting in debate that there may be exceptional circumstances to which a local housing authority should have regard, which so far, collectively, we have not been able to define within the Bill, the Government are accepting that there may still be holes to be plugged. That was why I felt it was important to move this amendment notwithstanding the previous debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para7"></a>Clause 157 with its provisions for giving reasonable preference is not quite the same as this amendment which states that Part VI is not to apply in the case of applicants who are likely seriously to be prejudiced in this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para8"></a>However, I shall read what the Minister has said, together with the previous debate, and possibly come back to the matter at Third Reading. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("(ii) section 17(1) of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (property adjustment orders after overseas divorce, &c.), or
<BR>
(iii) paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989 (orders for financial relief against parents).").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I speak at the same time to Amendments Nos. 6, 111, 121, 175, 176, 177, 208 and 209. I lay the blame for these amendments at the door of the noble Lord, Lord Meston, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. At Committee stage they taxed us with the necessity of ensuring that the various provisions for the transfer of property on matrimonial breakdown were properly reflected in housing legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-11_para12"></a>We resisted the temptation at Committee stage because we felt that there might be some added complexities to be dealt with. As noble Lords will appreciate from reading through the group of amendments, we were right. On behalf of her noble friend, I trust that the noble Baroness will agree that we have drafted the amendments well. If she feels that we have not, perhaps she will allow me to write to her.

<FONT SIZE=3>the drafting. Speaking for myself, the obligation is to draw drafting matters about which we have concern to the attention of the Government, heave a sigh of relief, and leave the matter to parliamentary draftsmen to do what they will with the issue.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 98, line 35, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para1"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving the amendment, I speak to Amendments Nos. 11, 13, 15 and 20 to 23. All those amendments make a single point. Some are merely consequential, others deal with the identical points.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para2"></a>It may not have been fully appreciated among your Lordships that this is a nationalisation Bill. We no longer expect such Bills from the party on our left, but it seems instead that we have them coming from the party opposite. We do not welcome them any more from one quarter than the other.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para3"></a>Amendment No. 8 deals with Clause 153(2), which states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by regulations prescribe classes of persons who are, or are not, qualifying persons in relation to a local housing authority". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In other words, the Secretary of State is to take all the decisions about who goes on the local authority register, on what criteria they are put there, who may not be put on the local authority register, and what criteria of need may not be taken into account in Clause 157(8), on <P>


<a name="column_43"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which we have already touched. The Secretary of State is to make all the decisions and the local authority is merely to rubber stamp them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para4"></a>That creates a paper chase. Secretaries of State, as used to be said of kings, must see with other men's eyes and hear with other men's ears. Therefore it has to be provided in Clause 154(4), that a local authority's housing register,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall contain such information ... as the Secretary of State may prescribe by regulations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Where a new need is identified, a massive flow of information has to go to the Secretary of State. Someone in Whitehall will have to read through it and it will take a long time. Then, perhaps too late to meet the need involved, a decision will flow back through a regulation, we shall assemble in the dinner break to debate it, and a new category of need will be taken into account. It is a cumbersome process. It was the kind of process of administration which used to occur in the reign of King Philip II of Spain. It took an extremely long time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para5"></a>It is not only on these Benches that the issue has caused some dismay. When looking through papers I came across these words, which I shall not attribute. The speaker, a member of the Conservative Party, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have spent 15 years in local government, and all of those 15 years as a district councillor I served on the housing committee. During that time I found that gradually the management powers of the council were eroded by central government. This was a big problem for us ... Here is another proposal which will mean that councils' hands will be tied and they will be restricted from exercising their best judgment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is not an opinion confined to one side of the House. If there is any point in having local councils--and we on these Benches believe with great passion that there is--they should be entitled to take account of local circumstances to assess local needs for themselves on the basis of first-hand knowledge. The provisions of Clauses 153 and 157 will prevent that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para6"></a>One always used to hear a great deal from the Conservatives about Edmund Burke, who saw society as made up of a series of little platoons. In the cohesion of those little platoons he saw a great deal of the cohesion that makes society hang together. When we listen to Conservatives now we hear of nothing but individuals and the state. The little platoons are being disbanded; they are going the way of the Highland regiments. Among those little platoons, the local authorities have had an important place for many centuries. In taking this discretion away from them, the Secretary of State is creating a great deal of work. The measure will produce slow reactions. Despite provisions for yet more regulations which are designed to prevent it, it will produce a great deal of unnecessary uniformity. It will do a great deal of harm. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend. My concerns about the provisions to which he has drawn attention are not as regards the paper chase. They are simpler and more fundamental. Despite the Government's lip service to the need for flexibility, for response to local circumstances, and so on--I have already said that it appears in their consultation paper <P>


<a name="column_44"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on allocation--they cannot bear to allow local housing authorities to take decisions for themselves. In the interests of good government I could understand an argument that the clauses should provide for classes of persons who will be qualifying persons, allowing a local housing authority to add other classes. These clauses allow the Secretary of State to prescribe classes of persons who are not qualifying persons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para7"></a>It seems so harsh and centralised that it almost defies belief. Clause 157(4) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may ... specify factors which a local housing authority shall not take into account". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I agree that a local housing authority should not take into account whether an applicant has red hair. However, I do not believe that any local housing authority whose members submit themselves on a four-yearly or annual basis to election will behave in such a silly fashion. Local housing authorities have an ability to assess qualifications, needs and so on for themselves, in the light of their own circumstances. That has already been alluded to, not only by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, in moving an earlier amendment, but also rightly by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-12_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, in moving the amendment, the noble Earl, with characteristic modesty, disapplied almost all the regulation-making powers in Part IV of the Bill. He went on to say that it was a "nationalisation" Bill. I fail to see the connection between the two, but the noble Earl in his wisdom obviously finds one, even if it is not shared by other people. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that the provision was harsh and centralised.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para8"></a>There are good reasons for having the Bill as it is. The purpose of the regulation-making powers is twofold. First, as already discussed in our consideration of the government amendments moved by my noble friend Lord Mackay earlier, we propose to use the power to remove the entitlement to social housing from certain classes of people from abroad. We may also use it to confer an entitlement on certain descriptions of people who, we believe, should be entitled to be considered for permanent accommodation by a local authority. We have in mind, for example, giving anyone over 18 who is owed a duty under the homelessness legislation a right to appear on the housing register.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para9"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, thought that the Secretary of State was taking all the decisions on who goes on the register. I remind him that in our January 1996 consultation we made it clear that we would only limit access to the register in respect of certain classes of people from abroad. However, we are minded to give entitlement to appear on the register to certain people who have clear needs--in other words, those who are owed a duty under the homelessness legislation. One might say, "Why do all that by regulation?" The answer is in order to make it flexible. We do not wish to put all possible permutations that might arise into the Bill and set them in concrete. By having orders, we can amend and adjust the provisions from time to time as circumstances change.
<P>


<a name="column_45"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para10"></a>Amendment No. 15 deletes subsection (4) from Clause 154. That is the regulation-making power for the Secretary of State to prescribe the content of an authority's housing register. If a person is entitled to see his entry on the housing register, there should be a need to ensure that it contains information which is of use to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para11"></a>Clause 157 is exposed to no less than four amendments. Amendment No. 20 deletes subsection (3), thereby removing the regulation-making power under which the Secretary of State may specify further descriptions of people to whom preference is to be given. Since the power is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure--I sense the noble Earl is somewhat fonder of it than he is of the negative procedure--his amendment seems off-beam because the matter will be able to be discussed by Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para12"></a>Subsection (4) would be lost from the clause under Amendment No. 21. That is the regulation-making power for the Secretary of State to specify the factors which a local housing authority shall not take into account in allocating accommodation. An example would be where an authority sought to give priority to people solely on the basis that they had been born in the area. That seems unfair.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para13"></a>Amendment No. 22 demolishes yet another subsection of Clause 157--subsection (5). That is the regulation-making power for the Secretary of State to prescribe the principles in accordance with which a scheme for the allocations procedure is to be followed. We are minded to use the power to make regulations restricting the involvement of elected members from decisions on individual applications. Amendment No. 23 disposes of subsection (6).
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para14"></a>That is all good, swiping draconian stuff. If we take the amendments together, they would leave Part VI open to a kaleidoscope of interpretation and application by local authorities. They could well do things quite differently. If authorities were to be left entirely to their own devices in the field of allocations, I fear that an intolerable situation would develop with inconsistencies and unfairness creeping in all over the place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para15"></a>I know that secondary legislation is anathema to the noble Earl. However, in an area such as this we must have regulations. I ask him to delve deep into his conscience and realise that if we were to put everything on the face of the Bill, there would be no way of altering it, short of other primary legislation. Knowing the noble Earl's dislike, like mine, of too much primary legislation, I am sure that he will agree that it is better to have it in secondary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-12_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has made the case for my amendment a great deal better than I did. In the course of answering, he entirely mistook its purpose. I am not just arguing about primary versus secondary legislation. My argument is that I do not see why the Secretary of State should have the powers at all. It seems to me an outrage that he should have them. It is a bureaucratic nightmare, a centralisation and the <P>


<a name="column_46"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>imposition of a remote and uninformed judgment on a local and informed judgment. It is a gross constitutional impropriety.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para16"></a>The Minister said that it would create a kaleidoscope. But the Government have admitted in discussion of Clause 9 of the Asylum and Immigration Bill as well as in this Bill that different regulations may be needed for different areas. The Government admit the need for a kaleidoscope because they admit the variety of local housing circumstances. If there has to be a kaleidoscope, why should it not be judged by those best qualified to do so--those who live in the area and who meet the people there every day. They should do it rather than have it all taken into the hands of Whitehall.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para17"></a>I did not expect the Minister to understand what I meant when I described it as a "nationalisation" Bill. I mean that the Government are turning local authorities into departments of Whitehall. That is not what local authorities are for. Because they are elected at different times and places and because they may be of a different political complexion from the governing party, no matter which party that may be, local authorities are a necessary part of the political variety which makes this a free country. To take that away I regard as a grave error of judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para18"></a>The noble Earl recommended the measures to me on the ground that they were designed to disentitle people from abroad. I know that he has been away and I too am glad to see him back in his place. However, if he had not been away he would not have supposed that that would act as a recommendation to me. Why is it the Government's business to decide? I understand why, once they have set out on that course, they need flexibility. Once they have taken powers that are too detailed for them to have at all, they need regulation-making powers in order to change their minds and further regulation-making powers in order to change their changes of mind. "Greater fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em" and so on ad infinitum.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para19"></a>Once again, I recommend to the Minister that he study the report of his noble friend Lord Renton on the drafting of legislation. He drew attention to the fact that this over-detailed, over-prescriptive, way of legislating based on a desire to foresee all possible cases--which of course no legislator ever can--necessarily leads to a multiplication of powers. Although it is moved by the pursuit of certainty, it ultimately ends in exactly the opposite.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-12_para20"></a>Above all, I believe what lies behind the Secretary of State's judgment is the utter impatience felt by all executives, and even more badly by those who have been there too long, with any check to their power to do what they like. This Government have shown great impatience with anything that has impeded their will. They have shown impatience with the judges, the European Union, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the Church, this House, and with local authorities. We are seeing here a part of a very wide constitutional battery. It has occasionally been parodied by governments who have been in office even longer than this Government have.

<A NAME = "60708-13_para11"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 16 I shall speak at the same time to Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. These amendments establish a formal review procedure for requesting a review of a decision to refuse to put somebody's name on a housing register or to remove it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-13_para12"></a>We have always been concerned to ensure that the benefits of a review procedure of this kind should somehow be made. The need for a formal review procedure is important where access to the housing register is concerned as this, in effect, controls access to long-term social housing. Your Lordships will no doubt be aware that many local authorities impose restrictions on access to their housing registers, for example, by reason of age or local connection. They will continue to be able to do so under the provisions of this part, subject to regulations made by the Secretary of State. The House has already discussed at some length the possible content of these regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-13_para13"></a>When the question of a formal review procedure was raised during Committee stage by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish said that he would consider bringing forward alternative proposals at a later stage, and that is what these amendments are.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-13_para14"></a>Amendment No. 16 requires authorities to notify applicants that they have been placed on the housing register. Amendment No. 17 requires an authority to notify the applicant of an adverse decision, and of his right to request a review. Amendment No. 18 deals with the review process itself and the procedure for notifying <P>


<a name="column_50"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applicants of a decision on a review. It enables the Secretary of State to make regulations about the form that the review process should take.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-13_para15"></a>I hope the noble Baroness will not mind, even if her noble friend, Lord Russell, minds, that the Secretary of State will be able to make regulations to this. I do not think the noble Baroness will mind because we have tried to meet the points about which she was concerned, and we have brought these amendments forward to do just that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I welcome these amendments. With regard to the regulation-making powers, I retain a certain cynicism about regulation-making powers in general. There are only so many times in an afternoon when one can make the point. I accept that these things may need to be fleshed out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-13_para16"></a>I should like to ask the Minister a question as regards Amendment No. 18 which allows for provision, by regulations, in the new subclause (2),
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"requiring the decision on review to be made by a person of appropriate seniority ...". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Are the Government intending, by regulation, specifically to include or exclude members? Are the Government anticipating that the review will be made by a senior officer, or is it possible that members may be involved? I ask the point not in order to advocate the involvement of members--there are arguments as to whether or not that may be a good thing--but because I am genuinely interested in what the Government are proposing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Earl for rising again. I welcome the amendment generally, but ask another question. Subsection (6) of Amendment No. 17, which is repeated as subsection (6) of Amendment No. 18, effectively says that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Notice required to be given to a person under this section shall be given in writing ..." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which, normally, I would submit, would be expected to mean that a letter would be posted to the applicant advising him of the situation. Then it goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and, if not received by him, shall be treated as having been given if it is made available at the authority's office for a reasonable period for collection by him." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para0"></a>We need to appreciate, when considering this subsection, the actual situation in housing offices. Some of them are very busy indeed; some of them deal with an enormous number of inquiries by tenants and applicants for housing. One of the risks associated with this particular subsection is that it may encourage applicants who fall into this category to keep going along to their local housing office to inquire whether the relevant notices come forward. It also would imply that a local authority would not have to post the letter. It just says "given in writing". Then they have a fall-back position of saying that as long as there is a copy in the office available for collection that appears to be all right. I should have thought that that was not a terribly satisfactory way for a public service to go about its business.
<P>


<a name="column_51"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para1"></a>Having said that, there is a genuine difficulty, if one considers those people who may apply to go on the local housing register and who are literally homeless and living on the street. Obviously, people in that kind of category will not be in a position, generally speaking, to receive mail from the local authority. I wonder, first, whether we could have some explanation of the Government's interpretation of how they would envisage the subsection working and whether the reference to notices being made available at the authority's office is in fact constructed to ensure that homeless and roofless people living on the streets have some mechanism for being in contact and receiving those written notifications. If that is the case, I wonder whether it might be useful to identify separately that particular category of persons. It may be that that is the Government's interpretation of that subsection anyway, but it would be useful for the House to have some explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, there is an interesting and somewhat unusual provision in Amendment No. 18, which states that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Provision may be made by regulations ... requiring the decision on review to be made by a person of appropriate seniority who was not involved in the original decision". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not know whether anywhere else in the Bill there is a definition of "appropriate seniority" and I do not know--it is my ignorance--whether a similar provision is included in other legislation. The expression "appropriate seniority" is one on which there could be differing views. It would be helpful if my noble friend could explain exactly what the Government have in mind there and what "appropriate seniority" in this case means.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-14_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may deal at the same time with the questions of my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. There are probably hundreds of thousands of decisions on housing made throughout the country. They are quite often made by relatively junior people and it is possible that there may be mistakes. The idea behind the Bill is that when a person appeals, it will go to a more senior person than the first one. It will not go to the person who made the original decision but to a more senior person. Some authorities may wish that the reviews go to one person and another authority may wish them to go to another. It is even possible, as the noble Baroness asked, that they go to members. They could be involved. The point is that they should go to a person who is above the rank of the person who originally took the decision. It will be up to the local authority to decide how best to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, is worried about the notice being required to be given to a person. It shall be,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"given in writing and, if not received by him, shall be treated as having been given". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not believe that there is anything sinister in that. Sometimes people move away. Sometimes a person can be given a letter and, if he is in a particularly fractious frame of mind, he throws it back into your face. <P>


<a name="column_52"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Sometimes he might even tear it up and say, "I'm not going to take any notice of that." It is not good enough to say that a person has to have read it because a person cannot be forced to read it. If one has gone through every reasonable method of getting in touch with that person to tell him what is being done and he is either not available or refuses it, then it is lodged with the local authority and one says, "We've done our best. This is the fact, which he can come and see whenever he wants." That is the reason for having that passage in the Bill. We do not feel that there is anything sinister in it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend say whether there is a similar provision in any other legislation, or is this one unique?

<P>
<A NAME="60708-14_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I beg my noble friend's pardon. I forgot to answer that question. If I were to have answered it, I should have had to say I do not know. I shall find out whether or not it is unique.

<A NAME = "60708-14_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak at the same time to Amendment No. 70. Grouped with those two amendments is Amendment No. 73, which I tabled to ensure that the Government themselves tabled an amendment, as they said in Committee they would. Indeed, they have done so. It is Amendment No. 71 which, strangely, is grouped with Amendment No. 42. Even more oddly, my noble friend Lord Mottistone tabled an amendment to that amendment (Amendment No. 71), which is Amendment No. 72, and that amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 56. So there is bit of a mare's nest. However, I propose to deal now with only Amendments Nos. 19 and 70, as I said. I shall not move Amendment No. 73 in due course. No doubt some government department responsible for grouping amendments will make certain that my noble friend Lord Mottistone has word that his Amendment No. 72 (his amendment to my noble friend's Amendment No. 71)  is grouped with Amendment No. 42.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para9"></a>Amendment No. 19 is designed to ensure that the allocation criteria for priority in social housing includes disabled people living in inaccessible or unsuitable housing. Clause 157 refers to the priorities for local authorities when allocating permanent social housing. There are serious concerns that disabled people living in inaccessible or unsuitable housing will receive no higher priority under this system than a disabled person living in accessible accommodation who wishes to move for other reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para10"></a>There must be some mechanism for making a distinction between a person who requires settled accommodation and who is currently in reasonable accommodation and a person who requires settled accommodation who is currently in completely <P>


<a name="column_54"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unsuitable accommodation. This amendment seeks to ensure that the first category--category (a) as listed in the clause--is clearly applied not only to those living in
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"insanitary or overcrowded or ... unsatisfactory housing conditions", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
but also to disabled people whose housing is unsatisfactory, not because of its condition or state of repair but due to its inaccessibility or unsuitability for the needs of that disabled person.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para11"></a>If reasonable preference is given to non-disabled people for a variety of reasons, including living in unsatisfactory housing conditions, the same category of preference must be open to disabled people because they are living in inaccessible housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para12"></a>At Committee stage, the Minister placed considerable emphasis on category (e), which refers to reasonable preference being given to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"someone with a particular need for settled accommodation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
However, the Minister stated that the words "unsatisfactory housing conditions" in category (a) would cover a disabled person who occupied inaccessible or unsuitable housing. He did not, however, state that the guidance would specifically point that out to local authorities. Rather, the Minister said that guidance would draw the attention of local authorities to their responsibilities towards people with physical disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para13"></a>It remains a serious concern that the guidance may simply make reference to general responsibilities rather than pointing out the wider interpretation of category (a), which the Minister gave. It is still important therefore that the issue is clarified on the face of the Bill. That will ensure that disabled people and local authorities have a clear view as to how category (a) applies to those people living in inaccessible accommodation. It will further ensure that there are no disputes or legal cases surrounding the interpretation of general statements within guidance. If the Government are not prepared to add the information to primary legislation, a commitment that local authorities should include inaccessible or unsuitable housing for disabled people within category (a) should be clearly stated in guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para14"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 70 is to ensure that when the local authority discharges its duty towards homeless people in priority need by satisfying itself that other suitable accommodation is available that accommodation meets the needs of the household, including any disabled members of that household. This section of the legislation allows local authorities to discharge their duty towards homeless people in priority need by satisfying themselves that suitable accommodation is available in the district. It is important that that accommodation meets the needs of the household and, in particular, the needs of any disabled members of the household.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para15"></a>In practice, local authorities could satisfy themselves that suitable accommodation is available by being aware that local letting agencies have vacant properties or that local private landlords have vacancies. Their only duty is to provide the applicant with advice and such assistance as they consider appropriate in the <P>


<a name="column_55"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances in any attempts he may make to secure such accommodation. Without regard to the needs of the household, particularly those of the disabled member, there could be considerable difficulties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para16"></a>I am advised that RADAR is aware of a case which effectively illustrates the problems of local authorities putting homeless disabled people into completely inappropriate accommodation. A London borough agreed in 1994 that a young disabled woman was unintentionally homeless and in priority need. As it could find no suitable accommodation within its own housing stock, it gave her one offer of temporary housing association property which was completely inaccessible to her. Due to her disability, the young woman had extreme difficulty using stairs and required warm accommodation. The accommodation she was offered was on the third floor with no lift and no heating. It was also extremely expensive, requiring not only housing benefit, but also taking a considerable contribution from her small medical pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para17"></a>As she was literally homeless, with nowhere to go, the young woman accepted the offer of accommodation; it was the only offer she had. Two years later the young woman is still living in that third floor flat. She requires daily support from social services, including doing all her shopping. She cannot get out of the flat independently and her condition has worsened. The local authority agrees that she requires wheelchair accessible accommodation but has made no offers of ground floor accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para18"></a>During the Committee stage my noble friend the Minister stated that the homeless code of guidance already referred to the need to ensure that any accommodation provided meets the needs of disabled persons where necessary and that that advice would be repeated in the revised code of guidance. However, there appears to be no specific reference within the current code to accommodation specifically meeting the needs of disabled people. The relevant section of the code states in paragraph 12.4:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The sort of accommodation a council can secure will depend on the circumstances of the particular household. Do they need special care and support from the health services or social services? What is their own preference? How will they pay for it?" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para19"></a>Local authorities must also have regard to other duties and legislation concerning slum clearance, overcrowding and houses in multiple occupation. That section does not refer to the need to ensure that any accommodation provided meets the needs of disabled people. It does not address the issues referred to in the amendment. There is no specific mention of disabled people or the requirement for accommodation to be accessible. In practice, this rather vague guidance does not have the effect of ensuring that disabled people are offered accessible accommodation which is suitable to their needs, as illustrated by the case I quoted. The result is that disabled people rely on case law definitions of suitability and contemplate legal action. That is not a good solution to the problem, particularly as people are often literally roofless with nowhere else to go and do not have the time for lengthy arguments about case law or to look at legal action.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-14_para20"></a>The other suggestion made during Committee stage was that the Secretary of State should specify by order other matters which could be taken into account in determining whether or not accommodation is suitable. Surely it would be preferable to decide at this stage whether the criteria set out in the amendment should be taken into account when determining whether or not accommodation is suitable. They are the basic criteria which determine whether an individual can live in a property and are best placed on the face of the Bill rather than being left to order-making powers at a later stage. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60708-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment. Indeed, I wanted to add my name to it, but I was too late to do so. The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, stated the case clearly and convincingly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para0"></a>It is important to include Amendment No. 19 on the face of the Bill. Inaccessible or unsuitable accommodation may have a serious spinoff or impact on disabled people and can limit their independence. Also, it can affect not only one's physical health and wellbeing, but also one's psychological and social welfare. In some instances it may retard and even prevent one's eventual rehabilitation. A case was instanced by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para1"></a>It would also be helpful to include Amendment No. 70 on the face of the Bill. I hope that the Minister--I am delighted to see him back at his post; I believe he has been back for a couple of days, but this is the first time I have seen him--will give us an encouraging reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-15_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has only himself to blame for facing this amendment. These are precisely the problems that arise when the Secretary of State takes the power to specify all the criteria for allocation of local authority housing. It means that as soon as he forgets to put anything in--as he has here--he will face well-founded, heartfelt and well-informed arguments suggesting that he do something about it. Inevitably, we will have a politicisation of the debate on the criteria for need. That debate has begun here and I cannot think of any more powerful ground on which it could have begun.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para2"></a>I particularly welcome Amendment No. 73. Simply to say that other suitable accommodation is available may be a temptation to a cash-strapped local authority which is very near its capping limit. And, as in the case mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, other accommodation which is suitable to anyone else may be completely unsuitable for somebody who lacks the mobility to get there. I found the example given by the noble Lord extremely moving. Normally when one thinks of the homeless one thinks that the one asset that they enjoy is their mobility; their ability to come and go and perhaps sleep in a different doorway because the wind is warmer in one than another. But if one lacks mobility, one cannot do that. It makes the pain of homelessness far greater than it would be under any other circumstances I can think of. These are important amendments. If the Secretary of State intends to keep control of all the criteria of allocation, he must find some way of accepting them.

<A NAME="60708-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support this amendment. The first amendment goes to the provision in Clause 157, which refers to reasonable preference being given to people living in, "unsatisfactory housing conditions". The reason why I particularly support the amendment is that I am not yet persuaded that "unsatisfactory" refers to anything more than the housing conditions. In particular, I am not persuaded that it can be construed to mean unsatisfactory for a particular person even if it is satisfactory for another.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-15_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Darcy (de Knayth) for what she has said. She said that she hoped that I would give a sympathetic reply. I hope to do just that and that it will satisfy her. I also hope that it will satisfy the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, too. The noble Earl is in a combative mood today. First, he said that we should not have any regulations and he then moved a whole host of amendments to take out all the regulations. Secondly, he says that if one is to have regulations, this particular regulation has not been included. Thirdly, he then explained how Xerxes created a bridge of boats and when the wind and the waves got up, the boats were upset and the men fell in the water and they were ordered to whip the sea. As regards that amendment, I wonder whether Xerxes was more successful in whipping the sea than the noble Earl was in whipping his own troops into the Division Lobby.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para3"></a>The fact is that one has to have regulations. There cannot be a completely different panoply of housing rules throughout the country so that Somerset will be different from Lancashire and Yorkshire different from Birmingham. There has to be some kind of regulation running all the way through, particularly as the Government provide a very great part of the funding.

<A NAME = "60708-15_para4"></a>What concerns me here is that the noble Earl blames the Government for not including various items whereas I am much more concerned that we see that the points are covered. In my view--and this is where I hope to be able to satisfy the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth) and, with a generous attitude from the noble Earl, persuade him also--these matters are covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 19 and 70, to which my noble friend has spoken, both relate to the particular needs of disabled people. Amendment No. 70 would insert into Clause 185 a requirement that other suitable accommodation, which is available for occupation, must meet the needs of the household in terms of affordability and size and it must be accessible to disabled members of the household.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para6"></a>Clause 185 in fact provides that the accommodation must be suitable for the needs of the applicant and his household. Where the household includes a person with physical disabilities, it must be suitable for his needs as well. I draw the attention of my noble friend Lord Swinfen to the terms of government Amendment No. 71 to Clause 185. This will provide that the advice and assistance must be commensurate with the personal <P>


<a name="column_58"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances of the applicant. I can assure my noble friend Lord Swinfen that this matter will be fully covered also in the forthcoming revised guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para7"></a>So I believe that the concerns that my noble friend has expressed--I can well understand them and he is entirely justified to be concerned--have been met in the Bill as it is. I admit to just a twinge of regret that the amendment which my noble friend originally put down did not appear on the face of the Bill. Originally, when it appeared in the list of amendments, the authorities would have been required to meet, "the needs of any desirable members of the household". Of course, that was a misprint, but I wondered how "desirability" would be defined to the satisfaction of all parties. One also wondered what would happen to the undesirable members. If they were rendered homeless, just think what would happen then!
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para8"></a>My noble friend has seen the folly of his ways--or at least his drafting and, possibly, even his handwriting. Even if he had written the amendment properly, which he has now done, it is still not necessary. Amendment No. 19 would insert into Clause 157 a requirement that disabled people who are occupying unsuitable or inaccessible housing should be among those to whom reasonable preference is given in allocating housing accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para9"></a>I hesitate to tell my noble friend, because I admire the work that he does in this direction, but this is an unnecessary amendment. Clause 157(2)(a) specifies that reasonable preference is to be given to those occupying "unsatisfactory housing conditions". In our view that description must, and does, embrace,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"disabled people occupying inaccessible or unsuitable housing". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Under Clause 157(3)(a) and (b) the Secretary of State can specify by regulations further descriptions of people to whom preference is to be given and he is enabled to amend existing descriptions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para10"></a>The allocations provisions of Clause 157 grew out of Section 22 of the Housing Act 1985. We are not aware that the omission of a specific reference to disabled people has in the past caused any problems, but if it did, we have the power to put matters right in the regulations should that be found to be the case. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Swinfen for the tragic example which he gave. I shall certainly look at the provisions to see whether that kind of case will be likely to be reflected in future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para11"></a>There is also the guidance. That will deal not only with homelessness and housing advice, but also with allocations. I shall look carefully at what my noble friend said about disabled people in the context of allocations. We shall try to incorporate any salient points in the guidance. In drawing up guidance on the applications provisions of Clause 157, we shall cover matters of physical accessibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para12"></a>My noble friend was concerned about the needs of the disabled not being covered by guidance, but I can assure him that we shall expand the matters on guidance. The present code was written before the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 was implemented so there is room for improvement there. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, suggested that what was <P>


<a name="column_59"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 59</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suitable for one person was not necessarily suitable for another. That may well be the case. The test of suitability is applied on a case-by-case basis. It should take account of the applicant's particular and peculiar needs. That is the reason why it is important that each person should be considered individually. The same applies to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who was also concerned about that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-15_para13"></a>I hope that I have been able to persuade your Lordships that, despite the quite correct concerns of your Lordships about making certain that disabled people are properly looked after, that is the case in the Bill as it stands. I hope that that will prove satisfactory to my noble friend Lord Swinfen; to the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy (de Knayth) and to the two noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches, even if one is a lady. I hope that they will both consider that their cases and concerns are met.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Earl sits down, may I raise one issue with him which he has not touched on? I did not intervene earlier because the case for these amendments had been made so eloquently and the initial response from the Minister suggested that all the points that had been raised by the amendments would be accommodated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para0"></a>But the noble Earl has not touched on one particular aspect of the amendments which is quite important. Amendment No. 70 refers to meeting,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the needs of the household in terms of affordability". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para1"></a>Those of us who are keenly interested in this Bill are very indebted to the noble Earl for the letter that he sent us today in which he makes reference to affordability raised by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, at Committee stage. In that letter the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, identified the fact that 80 per cent. of applicants for assistance receive housing benefit and that the normal limits of affordability regarding housing benefit would therefore apply. However, we are left with 20 per cent. who would not come under the general aegis of housing benefit, and the noble Earl has not said anything about the suitability of accommodation in terms of its affordability.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para2"></a>We must bear in mind that, because of the problems of negative equity and repossessions, significant numbers of people are now becoming homeless and are seeking support and help with their housing who would not normally be on council house waiting lists. Therefore, can the noble Earl say something about affordability in the context of the suitability of the accommodation? I hope that the Government will be able to give us some assurance on that matter. If not, I think that the text of Amendment No. 70, to which the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, spoke so eloquently should perhaps be pressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-16_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the noble Lord is relatively simple in that a house cannot be suitable for a person if he cannot afford to live in it. Therefore, "suitability" covers "affordability". The Ritz might be a suitable place in which to live, but if a person <P>


<a name="column_60"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot afford that it would be quite inappropriate to send him to the Ritz. As I have said, I think that "suitability" covers "affordability".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend finally sits down, I wonder whether he could clarify the phrase "unsatisfactory housing conditions". I got the impression that my noble friend was referring to more than just the physical structure of a building and its cleanliness, heating and draught-proofing. I have always understood that "unsatisfactory housing conditions" means poor quality housing and housing that should be condemned. I was referring to the "usability" of a house for a disabled person. It would be useful if my noble friend could clarify that point for me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-16_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the phrase "poor quality housing" must cover a number of things and must relate to the person concerned. That phrase would apply if the rain was coming in and if the sewers stank. A property would also be "poor quality housing" if it comprised one bedroom and a bathroom but the occupant was a single mother with five children. That would be considered "unsuitable". Equally, a property would be unsuitable if it was at the top of a block of flats without a lift and was offered to someone in a wheelchair. That would obviously be improper. The phrase covers more than just the physical condition of the housing, but that is an important element of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for going just a little further on that point, which needed clarification. On the whole, my noble friend has answered all my concerns, but I should like to read what he has said and to reserve my position as to whether to return to this on Third Reading. However, given what has been said I doubt whether that will be necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para3"></a>Referring to the first version of the amendment, I know that this was not due to my handwriting (because the amendment was handed in in typewritten form) but I like to think that everyone is "desirable" to someone. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para8"></a>As I have already said on a number of occasions, the Government are taking steps to ensure that persons who are subject to immigration control and have been given leave to remain on the basis that they will not have recourse to public funds do not have access to local authority housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para9"></a>The Government's wider policy aim of excluding such persons from entitlement to any tenancy of, or licence to occupy, council accommodation is achieved by the provisions of Clause 9(1) of the Asylum and Immigration Bill, which has been considered thoroughly both in another place and by your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para10"></a>It is important that that provision should continue to apply when the Housing Bill comes into  force. The purpose of this group of amendments is to bring that about. However, there would be one exception to the exclusion from entitlement to local authority accommodation of persons subject to immigration control with no recourse to public funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para11"></a>Those noble Lords who attended the House during consideration of the Asylum and Immigration Bill at Report stage will recall that Clause 9 of that Bill was amended at the request of a number of noble Lords--including some of my noble friends, but more particularly the noble Earl, Lord Russell--to enable provision to be made by order to allow local housing authorities to lease accommodation to a college or university for sub-letting to its overseas students. Subject to the accommodation being surplus to the authority's general housing needs, such leasing would be allowed regardless of whether the students being accommodated were, or were not, persons entitled to be allocated a council tenancy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para12"></a>The amendments would ensure that the broader provision on exclusions in Clause 9(1) of the Asylum and Immigration Bill continues to apply in England and Wales. This is important since the housing register is not the only route by which a housing authority may make its accommodation available.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para13"></a>Where an authority has hard-to-let accommodation which is not desired by those on its register it may consider making this available en bloc to other organisations seeking modest accommodation. This could include organisations in the voluntary sector looking for accommodation for persons who have no claim to public housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para14"></a>The amendments would also ensure that the "leasing" provision, if I may call it that, remains in force, allowing local housing authorities to continue to lease to colleges and universities accommodation which is surplus to their requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-16_para15"></a>The amendments will ensure that persons subject to immigration control who are in this country on the understanding that they will not have recourse to public funds do not have access to publicly subsidised local authority housing.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para3"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 27 and, if I may, I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 28, 29, 30, 32 and 34. All these amendments are small but significant, particularly as they relate to Clauses 165 and 166. The need for them has to some extent been identified by Shelter, to whom we are most grateful. The amendments are necessary because the current drafting of Clauses 165 and 166 has an effect which was not intended. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will welcome these amendments generally. The present homelessness provisions in Part III of the Housing Act 1985 deal separately with two different issues concerning whether accommodation is available to an applicant. The first condition is whether the applicant is homeless because he does not have accommodation available to him. The second <P>


<a name="column_63"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>condition relates to the duty that he is owed once unintentional homelessness and priority need has been established. That duty is to secure that accommodation is available for the applicant and his household. Broadly speaking, the drafting restates the provisions in Part III regarding the assessment of whether someone is homeless and the question of a duty to secure that accommodation is available for an applicant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para4"></a>The current drafting of subsection (1) of Clause 166 means that subsections (3) and (4) of that clause, together with all the provisions of Clause 167, which broadly deal with the question of whether it would be reasonable for somebody to continue to occupy their present accommodation, would apply also to Part VII as a whole, which includes making available fresh accommodation. This is not what was intended. It is not needed and it would upset the structure of the legislation, which follows that of the 1985 Act and the case law which is based upon it. Instead, we are seeking to apply the definitions only to the assessment of whether a person is homeless. These amendments therefore combine to rectify the drafting of Clauses 165 and 166 and in short put the situation back as it was under Section 58 of the 1985 Act. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-17_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak to Amendment No. 31, which is in the group of amendments referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers. This amendment stands in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Perhaps I should specify what is meant by "family member". This Bill reaffirms much of the old Section 75 of the 1985 Housing Act, that where an authority has a homeless applicant accommodation should be suitable for him and his family or
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside there." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In the Government's amendment, to which Amendment No. 31 is an amendment, the Government have changed the wording to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him as a member of his family." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We cannot believe that is an oversight: it must be deliberate. That would therefore exclude all those who are not considered members of his family, even though they naturally and normally reside with the applicant: for example, a carer. If somebody was severely disabled--the importance of this was confirmed by the recent direct payments Act which was recently guided through your Lordships' House--the legislation expressly forbids any resident family member from being employed as a carer. Therefore, any paid live-in carer must expressly not be a member of the family. If you therefore seek accommodation with sufficient sleeping accommodation for that carer, it will be ruled out for consideration under the Government's phraseology. It would also, I believe, possibly apply to a same-sex partner, whether family member or not.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para5"></a>The court rulings seem to conflict on this issue. This amendment, therefore, would allow the authorities to decide who might reasonably be <P>


<a name="column_64"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expected to reside with the applicant, be they a family member or not, which would be done on the individual circumstances of the case. No local authority would be exploited by this amendment, as the local authority would decide and not the applicant himself or herself. Particularly in those two situations, it seems that people who at the moment under the 1985 Act would have a right to be considered--carers and same-sex partners--would be excluded by the Government's amendment as it currently stands from acquiring accommodation which is suitable and large enough for them all. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-17_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I always long to be helpful to the noble Baroness and it would be so encouraging if I could be helpful to her. Indeed, it would be a surprise and a delight to the noble Baroness too, but she does sometimes make life terribly difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para6"></a>When speaking to the earlier Amendment No. 30, and others, I explained that it was our intention to rectify the drafting in Clauses 165 and 166 and to return the situation to what it was under Section 58 of the 1985 Act. Therefore, we would not have expected the amendment of the noble Baroness to be necessary. However, on looking at the matter further it became apparent that in drafting the provisions which relate to other persons who might reasonably be expected to reside with the applicant as a member of his family we have in fact cut out the provisions for professional carers who may be required to live in. This was not our intention, and I am delighted to tell the noble Baroness that I shall be happy to accept her amendment. I am very grateful to her for drawing the matter to my attention.

I listened carefully to what the Minister said, but I was not persuaded that his reply fully covered all the points that had been raised. These amendments offer alternative routes to the same goal; the first amendment is about availability and the second amendment concerns suitability. There is no disagreement between us, I think, that if private rented accommodation is to be a realistic option for homeless families, it has to be affordable. It is increasingly important, given the fact that housing benefit only covers the full rent in something like 60 per cent. of cases and that the housing benefit situation has now been tightened up even more ruthlessly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para15"></a>All the research I have seen suggests that eviction from the private rented sector is probably the single most common reason for homelessness, following only <P>


<a name="column_66"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the breakdown of shared arrangements with families and friends. Looking at the quarterly returns to the Department of the Environment on homelessness--these are randomly chosen but fairly typical district councils--I notice that in Northampton, in the last quarter that I looked at, something like 13 of the 87 families accepted as homeless had been evicted from the private rented sector. In Eden District Council, five out of 12 had been accepted in that quarter. In Bury St. Edmunds, 12 of the 40 had been accepted in that quarter. For anywhere between a quarter and a third of homeless families, according to the statistics of district councils I have seen, the loss of private rented accommodation was the main reason for homelessness. It is often, though not always, because they cannot pay the rent and their benefit does not cover it, but it may be that the situation has been worsened because of the issues of rent deposit schemes and rent in advance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para16"></a>This situation is likely to get worse, not better, given that in this Bill the Government make the six-month shorthold tenancy the residual tenancy with landlords having to opt out rather than opt in. In future, housing insecurity in the private rented sector will grow, not diminish. The Awua judgment accepted, as I am sure do the Government, that affordability is a material consideration. This is particularly a private rented sector problem. Rents in the private rented sector are likely to be anything between two-thirds and three times as much as equivalent council housing, especially in inner cities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para17"></a>The Government accepted all of this in the consultation paper on allocations earlier this year. They stated that reasonable preference should be given to those with limited opportunities to secure settled accommodation to reflect the particular difficulties that some households on low income might have in obtaining such accommodation in the private sector. Such households may also find that higher rents in the private sector are a deterrent to taking employment, given the rate at which housing benefit is withdrawn. Recent Rowntree research shows that families who are locked into housing benefit face a 65p taper before adding in the taper from council tax. If they find a part-time job and are on family credit they will pay a marginal tax rate of about 97p in the pound.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para18"></a>The only question is whether it is better to do it through the first amendment, which regards affordability as part of the consideration of what is available, or the second amendment, which defines what is considered to be suitable. We hope that the Minister will indicate his preferred route and support one of the two amendments. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60708-17_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the points that have been made are important. I am happy to support them. I do not believe that it is widely understood how far housing benefit now regularly falls short of meeting the rent. Shelter has today published a survey of a number of people rehoused in the private rented sector after homelessness. It finds that one fifth of them have had to find money from their benefits to pay their private sector rents. Shortfalls met from income support range from &#163;2.15 to &#163;23 a week. Twenty three pounds a week <P>


<a name="column_67"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out of income support does not leave one with very much to buy something to eat. We would welcome an assurance that in cases like that the accommodation would not be regarded as suitable. This is particularly important now that it will be universal practice, as it has been previous common practice, for people to be given only one offer and then to be found to be intentionally homeless if they do not take it up. It is even more important than before that that one offer should be suitable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-17_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said only one thing with which I disagreed. I refer to her reading of the Awua judgment. I have read that judgment with care. The precise point in that case was that Miss Awua had received an offer of permanent accommodation which she had refused. Since that was the central issue in the case everything else in the case was really obiter. As I understand it, it was not a finding by the court that temporary accommodation by itself was enough to prevent a person from being homeless. It was temporary accommodation only in the context of an offer of permanent accommodation which had already been made and refused. According to my understanding, the last paragraph of the judgment--which I regret I do not have to hand at this moment--made that point entirely clear. Since that is to be superseded by this Bill I do not need to spend too long on it. It would be a pity if a myth entered housing law based upon a judgment which caused confusion because there were too many reasons why the judge decided the matter as he did. Therefore, to find the ratio decidendi would require a considerable number of further cases. I hope that we will concentrate on the fact that, if there is only one offer, it must be suitable. It is not suitable if one has to find a large part of the rent out of one's income support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I too support the amendment. I use this opportunity to put two questions to the Minister. First, I seek the confirmation of the Minister as to the meaning of "available". In particular, does it retain its normal meaning as "available for occupation by a particular person", attaching the availability to the person concerned? I ask that question because later, in the context of Clause 181, the Minister has tabled an amendment to provide for satisfaction "that the accommodation was suitable for him"; in other words, it applies suitability to an individual. I wonder whether there is any difference here to which we should be alerted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para0"></a>Secondly, I should like to ask the Minister about the timetable for regulations. I thank him for his long letter which comments on a number of issues. That letter arrived in the course of this afternoon. In it the Minister says that his department intends to consult the relevant interested bodies about the content of regulations to be made under Part VII and to have those regulations ready in time for commencement. Can the Minister confirm that actual regulations will be ready for commencement, not--as might be read <P>


<a name="column_68"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 68</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into this--draft regulations? It is important that the regulations on suitability are in place by the time that these parts of the legislation are in force.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-18_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, flushed with the success of the previous amendment, I long to be helpful again to the noble Baroness. For the moment, my basket has run out of goodies, not because I disagree with the way in which the noble Baroness puts her case but because of the way in which the amendments may operate. The noble Baroness seeks to put beyond doubt that accommodation may be regarded as available to an applicant only if he is able to comply with the terms of the tenancy, in particular by being able to afford the rent. That may seem to be a perfectly reasonable proposition. Your Lordships will be aware that there was some discussion on the question of affordability at Committee stage when the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, proposed a similar amendment. There is already a degree of case law to support the proposition that someone is homeless if he cannot afford the rent of a property and that accommodation that may be offered in discharge of a duty is not suitable if the applicant cannot afford the rent. I refer to the answer that I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell. One may be offered the Ritz but if one cannot afford it it is not much good. The noble Baroness feels that the matter is not beyond doubt and seeks to insert a provision to this effect on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para1"></a>In speaking to the amendment of the noble Baroness in Committee, my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish said that the proper place to set out what constituted affordability was in an order rather than on the face of the Bill. I believe that that is right. Circumstances and people's expectations as to what constitutes affordability are apt to change. It is important that we equip ourselves with powers which can adapt to changing attitudes and circumstances, even if that means, by the grace of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, secondary legislation. The noble Earl asked whether expensive accommodation was suitable. Accommodation is not suitable if a person has to find a large part of the rent himself and cannot afford it from his resources. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked whether availability attached to a person. I answer that by reminding the noble Baroness of the example that I gave earlier. A single parent with five children may be offered one bedroom and a kitchen. That may be available to someone but it is not available to her, nor is it suitable for her.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para2"></a>With regard to the regulations, we intend to make an order on affordability before the commencement of the Act, I hope by October, and we will consult on the regulations and the form that they will take beforehand. It will be the final order. It will not be the draft order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether there is as much difference between us as the Minister may think. Unless there was some slip of the tongue, what he said is that what counts as affordable would be conveyed in guidance. He did not <P>


<a name="column_69"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say what counts as available but what counts as affordable would be conveyed in guidance. I absolutely agree. What counts as affordable should be conveyed in guidance but the question of affordability as part of the definition of being available or suitable should be on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para3"></a>I wonder if, with the leave of the House, the Minister can confirm that he did say what he meant to say, in which case he is actually supporting my argument that "affordable" should be part of the definition of the criteria of what is available or suitable, but that what counts as affordable in the light of the housing benefit situation and local reference rents should indeed be carried by guidance. In that case, there would be no difference between us. Therefore, I wonder whether the noble Lord did mean to say that what counts as affordable becomes part of the guidance or whether he meant to say what counts as available be part of the guidance. With the leave of the House, perhaps he could help me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-18_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will try to help the noble Baroness, though of course with words such as "available", "suitable" and "affordable" it can become quite complicated. Perhaps I can set the noble Baroness's mind at rest. I always enjoy doing so, and I seem to be doing that quite well this afternoon. I can confirm to her that we intend to make use of the order-making powers in this part to address the issue of affordability. We will use those powers in order to place beyond doubt that accommodation is suitable for an applicant only if it is affordable. We intend to discuss the detail of our proposal for this order with the local authority associations and other interested parties in due course. I hope that the noble Baroness may rest her head quietly in contentment, not only with my answer but also with the fact that we shall discuss it with the local authority associations before the order is produced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that answer. Our difficulty, of course, is that the case law has been somewhat opaque. I am simply concerned as to whether something which is quite so pivotal to the notion of accessibility--that is whether the rents are affordable--can be left to order-making powers. Obviously the Minister has said this on a previous occasion and we were not sufficiently persuaded, but we will consult and see whether his answer this afternoon still further allays our worries on the matter. With the leave of the House, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(a) a person who normally resides with him as a member of his family, or
<BR>
(b) any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him as a member of his family.
<BR>
For this purpose "domestic violence", in relation to a person, means violence from a person with whom he is associated, or threats of violence from such a person which are likely to be carried out.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 35 and speak also to Amendments Nos. 37 and 76. These three amendments work together to deliver a commitment which was made in another place to broaden the definition of domestic violence so as to embrace violence from partners who are no longer living with the victim.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para9"></a>Amendment No. 35 expands the wording of Clause 167 so that it will not be reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if it is probable that this will lead to domestic violence against him or against a member of his family who resides or might reside with him. Of course, as in the Civil Service, the male embraces the female and therefore that refers to her as well. It specifies that domestic violence is violence, or threatened violence from someone with whom he is "associated".
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para10"></a>The definition of "associated" brings us to Amendment No. 37 which inserts a new clause after Clause 167 setting out the circumstances in which a person is "associated" for the purposes of Part VII of this Bill. It is a long and detailed list which some of your Lordships may recognise from the Family Law Bill. Indeed, that Bill was the source of this clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para11"></a>Amendment No. 76 is a small but significant consequential amendment. By extending those definitions and importing a definition of "associated person" into this part of the Bill, we are trying to tackle the situation whereby a person is subjected to violence or threats of it by a very wide but strictly defined group of people. Our main aim is to deal with actual or threatened violence on the basis of a person's relationship rather than on the basis of what might be described as a "residency-type qualification".
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-18_para12"></a>These are technical but important and significant amendments. I hope that your Lordships will agree to them. I beg to move.

It seems to me that the same point would apply to Amendment No. 35 where, again, we have the same words. In so far as the Minister suggested there had been some oversight and that Amendment No. 31 corrected this, it may well be that the same principle would apply here and the Minister would be happy, pleased or <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>delighted to accept the particular proposition. Obviously I do not have an amendment tabled to that effect, but if that were the case and the Minister were to say so, then clearly we could see what would happen at the final stage of the Bill. As is clear, the point is very different from the categories covered in Amendment No. 37, as is clear. So I hope that the Minister will see his way to agreeing that there is a small defect in Amendment No. 35 which he will put right.

<A NAME="60708-19_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I do congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. I think it is the first time today in which he has participated in our discussions. The proceedings have been bereft without him, even though they have been looked after by the noble Baroness with exemplary duty. He makes a very important point. The noble Lord is a man of great perspicacity because he has, I think, found something. I believe that he is right and, if I may, I will ensure that we amend that at a later stage in the Bill. I am grateful to him for his vigilance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I thank the Minister. It is a real delight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, the Minister leapt to his feet so fast--he is obviously getting into practice--but my noble friend and I both have questions on Amendments Nos. 35 and 37.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para0"></a>My first question is to ask the Minister to confirm whether paragraph (f) in the new clause (set out in Amendment No. 37), which refers to both people having had "parental responsibility", covers the situation where one person is the parent of the child and the other is a step-parent. Sadly, there are occasions when the relationship between step-parents--one a natural parent and one a step-parent--has led to domestic violence. That is my first question in relation to subsection (1)(f).
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para1"></a>My second question relates to the definition of "domestic violence", which is referred to as being violence or threats of violence from such a person which are likely to be carried out. I am concerned about how it is possible or whether it is appropriate in that context to assess the likelihood of threats being carried out rather than approaching this on the basis of the concern of the person who may be the subject of those threats; in other words, that domestic violence should mean actual violence or threats of violence which give rise to reasonable concern that they will be carried out, thus importing a degree of subjectivity rather than objectivity which may be very difficult to prove.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for these amendments and I echo the question which my noble friend has just asked. But I believe that these amendments will sit well with Part IV of the Family Law Bill and provide a back-up where it is needed. It is a significant contribution to what the Government have done on that subject.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para2"></a>On Amendment No. 37, I should like to know that I am correct in my reading of the words and that this covers same-sex partners or carers. With that sole question, I welcome warmly these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I wish to continue the line of questioning which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, adopted, in relation to what is meant by "domestic violence". Do the Government include within that term psychological violence as well as physical violence? I bear in mind the recent successful court case where a stalker was prosecuted for psychological rather than physical damage. Is that now included in government thinking about the term "domestic violence"? Does it include psychological as well as physical violence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for jumping up and so bouncing the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, from an opportunity to take part in the debate. I was so excited at being able to give the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, a bit of encouragement that I was accelerated in levitation and I should not have been.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para3"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether a step-parent would be included in these provisions. The full parent and one step-parent are covered by the term "parental responsibility". The noble Baroness was concerned also about whether violence would be carried out and about threats of violence. That depends very much on the case and whether it is a real threat. Obviously domestic violence takes a number of different forms and each case must be considered on its merits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para4"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, asked me whether the provision covers same-sex partners. It does because it covers cohabitants. If they are cohabiting, they are covered by the provisions of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for interrupting the noble Earl, but subsection (3) refers explicitly to a man and woman who are not married to each other but are living together as husband and wife. Therefore, it appears that the definition excludes same-sex partners. I hope that what the Minister says is correct, but if it is, the definition "cohabitants" would need to be amended accordingly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I must say that the Opposition are scoring a lot of brownie points today. They are being enormously vigilant. The information which I gave the noble Baroness is wrong and the noble Baroness is right. I apologise for misleading your Lordships. I am very glad that the noble Baroness has corrected me.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para5"></a>I turn now to the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell. He is worried about psychological violence. I cannot think why he wants to be worried about that but he is. He asks whether that is covered by these provisions. I cannot give him a very good answer. It is not ruled out, but psychological violence covers a very wide spectrum. <P>


<a name="column_73"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It would depend on the nature of the violence. We do not rule out the fact that psychological violence could be covered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness asks another important question to which the answer is in the affirmative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 36:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 103, line 7, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) "It is not reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if proceedings for possession of the dwelling house have commenced and the person has no defence against those proceedings.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment deals with possession proceedings and the extent to which it is necessary to require a defendant in such proceedings to go all the way through with them, if I can use that expression.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para8"></a>The point was dealt with, although rather late, at the last stage of the Bill on 19th June and the Minister commented on the matter at col. 416. At that time, I argued that it was inappropriate to require people threatened with homelessness and who have no defence to go through with the expense and ordeal of a court hearing where a mandatory possession order is inevitable. Not only will those people incur expense, but so too will everybody else involved. The stress as well as the expense is an important factor in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para9"></a>Eviction from assured shorthold tenancies is an increasingly common cause of homelessness. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, referred to that earlier today. Some 11 per cent. of homeless households accepted for rehousing have become homeless because of the ending of an assured shorthold tenancy. The Bill is aimed at making such tenancies the default tenancies, if I can put it that way, of the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para10"></a>The Minister said that the department's recent study which evaluated the Homelessness Code of Guidance found that almost all--something like 94 per cent., he said at col. 416--authorities would take a notice to quit or a notice of seeking possession as evidence of impending homelessness. Accepting that, it nevertheless leaves some 6 per cent. or thereabouts which do not take notice to quit and so on as evidence of impending homelessness. Some authorities undoubtedly are still insisting on tenants undergoing the expense and problems associated with a court hearing to gain a possession order before they can be accepted as homeless.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para11"></a>I believe that that approach is counter-productive. I have referred to costs. The load of court business is also increased and I think that requiring tenants to stick it out to the very last, when inevitably they will have to leave, is contrary to the Government's own aim of encouraging landlords to let their properties.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-19_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness said that she tabled this amendment again to enable the Government to reconsider it. She is right to be concerned. There are always border lines and it is always right to be concerned about those people who fall on the wrong side of the border line. The noble Baroness said that she did not want the inclusion of this amendment to undermine what we are trying to do in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para13"></a>The Homelessness Code of Guidance makes it clear that authorities should not require applicants to have to fight possession proceedings where there is no chance of success--for example, when an assured shorthold tenancy is being repossessed at the end of a fixed term--before accepting that a household is being threatened with homelessness. Indeed the recent Department of the Environment study--an evaluation of the Homelessness Code of Guidance--showed that almost all authorities (94 per cent.) would take a notice to quit or notice of seeking possession as evidence of impending homelessness. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that about 6 per cent. do not do so. As the accountants would say, the arithmetic stacks up between us.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para14"></a>We have tried to guide the 6 per cent. to accept such orders, but we would not wish to make that mandatory in every case. That is why I am doubtful that we want the proposition advanced in the amendment. There are many different forms of tenancy, and many different grounds for possession. There are many defences which can apply in particular cases, both technical--for example, the proper service of notices--and substantive. In some cases it would be extremely difficult and costly for a local authority to make a decision without going through the facts of each case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para15"></a>A possession order may take several months to come into effect. We do not believe that it is either necessary or reasonable to expect local authorities immediately to assist people in such a position. We would however expect authorities to be ready to assist people where they have been alerted to the existence of a possession order, and to make appropriate arrangements without insisting that an applicant goes to court. If it were to prove necessary, the Secretary of State could make an order under this clause--with the agreement of the noble Earl, Lord Russell--to ensure that authorities take proper account of possession orders in assessing whether it is reasonable for an applicant to continue to occupy accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-19_para16"></a>I understand the concern behind the amendment--the noble Baroness is quite right to be concerned--that people with no defence against a possession order should receive timely assistance. However, as the existing arrangements are shown to work well--and we can reinforce the point when we issue new guidance, as we probably shall--I advise your Lordships not to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>introduce a new requirement which, at the margin in a difficult case, would require a local authority to anticipate the decision of the courts. I hope that on reflection the noble Baroness will agree that that is the right course to take. It has worked well and I suggest that it would be better for us to continue with it rather than to include mandatory requirements in the Bill.

<A NAME="60708-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether it has worked as well as the Minister says. The percentage which he gave--and which his noble friend gave at the previous stage--of 94 per cent. was not a percentage of all cases; it was a percentage of authorities which take notice to quit as evidence of impending homelessness. That does not suggest to me that the provision is working well. Rather it suggests that some authorities take one line while others routinely do not take note of notice to quit. I am not convinced, from the way the Minister has presented this, that the code of guidance could be capable of being used to distinguish between good notices to quit and bad notices to quit, if I can put it that way. I refer to the notices which will be effective and those which may not be effective. However, perhaps this is not the point at which to pursue the matter further. For the moment we shall have to agree to differ. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-20_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a third time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para4"></a>We are now concluding our consideration of the Security Service Bill. The Bill has not been changed in the course of its passage through the House, but in no way does that detract from the rigour of the scrutiny to which it has been subjected. At Second Reading I predicted that our discussions on the Bill would benefit greatly from the wealth of expertise that your Lordships' House can draw upon. I am happy to say that that prediction was correct. We have been able to draw upon the particular knowledge and personal experience of a number of noble Lords--expertise covering the police service; the intelligence agencies; and the workings of government, from both the ministerial and civil service perspectives.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para5"></a>Though this Bill is short, it is significant. It will enable the Security Service to use the skills and expertise that it has built up over many years in the fight against terrorism to support the police and other law enforcement agencies in their work against serious crime. Counter-terrorism work will still remain the service's top priority but it is clearly sensible that, when resources permit, the Security Service should be able to make a contribution to the efforts that are made to combat organised crime. I am sure the House does not need me to spell out the threat to decent society that is posed by organised criminals, and therefore the importance of bringing all the means at our disposal to the battle against that threat.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para6"></a>I know that the principle underlying this Bill has received support from all parts of this House. It is important that the House has been united in its determination that everything must be done to tackle the menace of organised crime. As your Lordships are aware, this Bill is not the only piece of legislation that the Government intend to bring forward to ensure that the response of the law enforcement agencies to organised crime is as effective as it can be. This Bill is a precursor of a package of further measures. They include the creation of a unified crime squad to build on the sterling work already done by regional crime squads, and a proper statutory footing for the National Criminal Intelligence Service. We also intend to legislate on police intrusive operations. That is a subject that we have touched on at several points during our consideration of this Bill and my right honourable friend the Home Secretary gave further details of our thinking on this only last week.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para7"></a>This is not the occasion to debate those issues. The plans have not been finalised, but let me assure the House that they are developing well and in line with the timetable required to meet our commitment to bring forward early legislation. Importantly, they also command the support of the police. It is clear from our discussions of the present Bill that your Lordships will wish to return to a number of important issues when this House comes to consider that legislation. That is entirely right and proper. In the meantime, there is no reason why we should not proceed with the present Bill. It is a discrete measure, even though it forms part of the Government's wider strategy for tackling the menace of organised crime. It is also a sensible measure, enabling, as I have said, our law enforcement agencies to benefit, where appropriate, from the skills and support of the Security Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para8"></a>Furthermore, by passing this Bill, Parliament will also send a positive statement of our firm intent to combat the drug traffickers, the racketeers and the money launderers with every legitimate means at our disposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para9"></a>The Government are determined to address the issue by making provision to allow the expertise and skills to be brought to bear. I think that I can speak for all parts of the House when I say that there should be no doubt about the importance of tackling the menace of organised crime firmly and effectively. Bringing the skills of the Security Service into play will help us to do that. I commend the Bill to the House.

She knows that from the beginning to the end of our discussions on the Bill we have supported that aim. We have supported generally the package of measures which the Prime Minister set out in his Blackpool speech last year.
<P>


<a name="column_78"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para11"></a>At the same time the Minister describes the Bill as being a "discrete" measure. I assume that she refers to "discreteness" rather than "discretion". It is not a discrete measure unfortunately. In Clause 2 it has implications for the police service and for the Security Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para12"></a>It might not have been immediately obvious when the Bill was first drafted, but I do not think that we should let the occasion of this Third Reading pass without recording that Clause 2, which deals with warrants, raises important questions of civil liberties. They were raised in Committee and in particular at Report stage, but unfortunately have not been resolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para13"></a>On the day after our Report stage, the Economist--not, I suggest, a journal particularly in opposition to the Government--had a fierce article about the Bill. It stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An Englishman's home has always been his castle, inviolate from intrusion without a court warrant. No longer, it seems. As the Economist went to press, the Security Service Bill looked certain to canter through its final stages in the House of Lords on June 27th". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not know whether the Minister or I would call it cantering through, but the Bill went through with two Divisions. The article continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill casually tosses aside individual freedoms for which Britons have fought for centuries". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para14"></a>That is not only the view of the Economist. It was also expressed in leading articles in the Guardian and the Observer. More importantly, it was expressed in concerns by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, both in Committee and at Report stage. The noble and learned Lord described this as a "major constitutional shift". He asked three times as to whether his interpretation was right; and he did not receive an adequate answer. It is not just that the definition in Clause 2 of serious crime is very wide, although it is. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, told the House correctly at Second Reading that the definition, as we have it, could cover a common burglar and a protester against the Newbury bypass.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para15"></a>That is not the only issue. The power to authorise a warrant for intrusive surveillance--the Minister has referred to intrusive activities--by the Security Service is to be given not on a judicial warrant but on an executive warrant, the warrant of the Secretary of State. That is the matter which was first determined in the case of Entick v. Carrington in 1757, which is now apparently to be overturned, I suspect without malice aforethought or without adequate thought. I cannot believe that it can seriously be the Government's intention to turn aside the most important rule: that the executive--Ministers--should not have the power to intrude into the homes of the people of this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para16"></a>The powers of the police are unclear and inadequate. As Ministers have recognised, it is true that they will have to be tidied up. But that should not justify, or be thought to justify, extending the warrant powers of the Secretary of State in relation to the Security Service, as is provided for in the Bill. At the very least, there ought to be congruity between the police powers and the Security Service powers when they seek to pursue for <P>


<a name="column_79"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrest and conviction, and as regards the detection of serious crime. That ought to be the minimum requirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para17"></a>There should be a further requirement that the executive, through the Secretary of State, does not have powers over the home of people in this country which have never been available previously to the executive and which have been deliberately confined to the judiciary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para18"></a>We shall have to come back to many of these matters when we come to the further legislation which the Government now propose, as the Minister rightly observed. We shall have to consider police powers in particular for intrusive surveillance. There are powers for search warrants given by magistrates or judges. There are powers under the Interception of Communication Act 1985 for telephone tapping, and, presumably, also for interception of the post. But all we have for intrusive surveillance are the 1984 Home Office guidelines on covert listening devices and visual surveillance in private places. Those guidelines state only that they are applicable when normal methods have failed and when it is likely that such surveillance will lead to arrest and conviction. Those are not adequate safeguards. They have to be more precisely defined than in those Home Office guidelines.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para19"></a>That has been recognised by the courts. The case of Sultan Khan is now, I believe, before the Judicial Committee of your Lordships' House. That case follows the remarks in the Court of Appeal by the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor of Gosforth. Those results will be of great importance to the interpretation and validity of the Bill. The European Court of Human Rights is also considering the case of Alison Halford, the former assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, who has complained of the bugging of her office, and I believe her home, by police colleagues. That case could result in a judgment that the existing British law, including this Bill, is a breach of privacy without judicial warrant which could be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para20"></a>It is by no means certain that the Bill will be enacted unscathed. Cases before both our courts and the European Court still leave the matter unresolved. However, as the Bill stands, I am afraid that I have to agree with the judgment of the Economist that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Bill casually tosses aside individual freedoms for which Britons have fought for centuries". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
To that extent the Bill is, regrettably, in default of the proper care which Government should have for the liberties of the individual citizen; and of the most fierce parliamentary scrutiny--it is partly my fault--which might otherwise have been expected.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para21"></a>It is because we support the objectives of the Bill that we have been perhaps calmer than we might. However, I warn the Minister that when the rest of the package of legislation comes back before Parliament in the next Session, we shall look to ensure not only that the powers of the law enforcement agencies are adequate to the serious problems which they face from organised crime, but also that the package includes proper protection of the liberties of individual citizens of this country.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, on occasions like this there is always a temptation to repeat one's excellent Second Reading speech. I shall do my best not to do so. I tried to set out the background to the Bill on Second Reading and in my view nothing has been said during the Committee and Report stages or by the noble Baroness this afternoon that has undermined the judgment I then made. It was that there was understandable anxiety in the Security Service that there would be widespread redundancies. There was a hunt for new areas of activity where it could be argued plausibly that the Security Service had a contribution to make. That is the reality of the situation that we face with the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para22"></a>I am not an opponent of the Bill, but am sceptical for two reasons. First, only 17 or 18 members of MI5 will be involved in work of that character in any event. Secondly, I was interested to hear the noble Baroness say a few moments ago that "when resources permit" the Security Service would become involved in the activities she outlined. That rather implies to me that the number of MI5 officers involved will not be substantial although they can make a positive contribution for the reasons indicated by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Condon. I referred to that during the Second Reading debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para23"></a>The point to which I wish to return was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh; namely, the case of Khan. I have the judgment of their Lordships' Appeal Committee on the matter and wish to refer to two of the judgments given on that occasion. First, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley, gave his judgment in turning down Mr. Khan's appeal. Mr. Khan was a rather unattractive gentleman in the heroin business in South Yorkshire. The noble and learned Lord said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Though I have no doubt in this case that the Chief Constable [of South Yorkshire] exercised his discretion fairly and bona fide I consider that fairness both to accused persons and to those who have to exercise this discretion make it highly desirable that such interceptions should be governed by legislation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We then come to the lead judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The sole cause of this case coming to your Lordships' House is the lack of a statutory system regulating the use of surveillance devices by the police. The absence of such a system seems astonishing, the more so in view of the statutory framework which has governed the use of such devices by the Security Service since 1989, and the interception of communications by the police as well as by other agencies since 1985. I would refrain, however, from further comment because counsel for the respondent"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
that is the Crown--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"was able to inform us, on instructions, that the government proposes to introduce legislation covering the matter in the next session of Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The noble Baroness gave such an undertaking, but, as I pointed out, the Government have a perilously short period in which to carry through the undertaking. It is the period between November this year and April next year. After that, they have the good fortune of meeting the electorate. During that short period, the Government will presumably have to introduce the legislation. <P>


<a name="column_81"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They could easily be faced with a situation in which the legislation has not passed through all its stages by the time the Prime Minister has to dissolve Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para24"></a>On a previous occasion, one of the noble Baroness's predecessors had to approach both Opposition parties after the Prime Minister of the day indicated that there was to be a general election. The Minister had to ask what sections of the legislation we were prepared to agree to pass into law, on that occasion without adequate discussion. We undertook to allow part of the Bill to go on to the statute book because of the urgency.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para25"></a>I hope that if we are to have a re-run of that situation, for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, there will be some form of discussion or consultation before we are faced with an approach of that kind. I would be extremely concerned at any suggestion that the person who would decide on the bugging warrants for police forces should be a Minister of the Crown rather than a judge. That is not just for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, but for different reasons. I do not like the idea of Ministers of any government becoming involved in operational policing issues. I cannot see how they could avoid becoming involved in such issues if they were to have the power conferred on them to approve warrants of that kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para26"></a>Apart from anything else, it seems to me that it would be far more sensible to allow a High Court or Crown Court judge to make a decision on the matter. I hope that that will be considered by the Government between now and the time when they introduce the legislation. I repeat that I hope that we will not be asked, just after the Prime Minister announces that he will be compelled to have a general election, to agree to pass legislation of this kind in a situation where we could not give it careful consideration. Some of us would be troubled by such a power being put in the hands of Ministers alone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-20_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, despite what the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, said, I recognise that both noble Lords agree with my opening statement that there is unanimity among us that this is an important issue for us to address. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, suggested that the property warrant power dealt with in Clause 2 amounts to a change of constitutional significance. For what he said he prayed in aid the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, at the previous stage of the Bill. The noble and learned Lord is not in his place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para27"></a>Without presuming to get into a debate over legal interpretation, the Government's reading of the position is that the celebrated case of Entick v. Carrington established the important principle that a person's house should not be entered without lawful authority. With the passage of the Security Service Act 1989, subsequently updated by the Intelligence Services Act 1994, Parliament legislated to allow the Security Service to apply for warrants authorising entry on, or interference with, property under rigorously controlled circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para28"></a>Authorisation by the Secretary of State in accordance with this legislation represents lawful authority. All that has changed is that the Security Service will now be <P>


<a name="column_82"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>able to apply for property warrants in pursuance of its new statutory function relating to serious crime, in addition to its existing national security and economic well-being functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para29"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Knights, who is also not in his place, pointed out on Report that the distinction between national security and police matters is not clear cut. The police deal with counter-terrorism matters often in tandem with the Security Service. Terrorist groups get involved in drug trafficking to finance themselves. Further, no such distinction between national security and policing matters was made in the historic judgment that we have been discussing. The mischief that was being addressed in 1765 related to a case of sedition which, if anything, would be a national security case today.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para30"></a>In short, this Bill will not extend the Security Service's powers; it will merely extend the functions under which those powers can be applied. I do not accept that that represents a change of constitutional significance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para31"></a>The noble Lords, Lord McIntosh and Lord Harris of Greenwich, referred to the lack of judicial authorisation. The Security Service is accountable to the Secretary of State. Being responsible for authorisation of the service's warrants is an important way in which he can exercise those responsibilities. It would be unprecedented and inappropriate to involve the judiciary in the intelligence gathering process, without knowledge of the target and before it was known whether criminal charges were in prospect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para32"></a>Warrants can be authorised only in tightly controlled circumstances and the issue of all warrants is subject to scrutiny by the independent commissioner. He is a senior member of the judiciary and therefore provides judicial scrutiny of the decisions of the Home Secretary, applying the principles of judicial review.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para33"></a>I find it a preposterous idea to suggest that this Bill came about as a result of possible redundancies or, as I believe the noble Lord said, a lack of work for the Security Service. I do not believe that the Security Service has ever been more challenged than it is today. Its work is important.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-20_para34"></a>That links well to the other point referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich; namely, my reference to "when resources permit". It must be "when resources permit", because the primary function for the security services is counter-terrorism. They will work in support of police activities, and will be requested by the police to support them in those activities. If they find that acceding to a request from the police would inhibit or thwart in any way their primary function, it would be for the security services simply to say that they were not in a position to offer that support. It must be right that the Security Service considers its primary function first.

<A NAME="60708-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness was kind enough to refer to my speech but said it was "preposterous". If it was quite so preposterous, I am mildly surprised that she did not bother to indicate as much when she replied to the speech that I made on the matter at Second Reading <P>


<a name="column_83"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when, as my authority, I drew on a report by a House of Commons committee. Therefore she rather overstates her case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I have not seen a statement in any House of Commons committee report which says that the sole reason for the Bill is somehow to fill a gap for the security services and prevent redundancies. If the noble Lord can find such a quotation, I should like to see it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para0"></a>The Security Service Bill fulfils a very important function. But, in the fight against organised crime--money laundering, drug trafficking and the serious crimes to which we have referred during the course of the Bill--we also believe that bringing the expertise of the security services together with that of the police is a very important measure. We believe that the intellectual validity of the Bill is well understood. It is simply not a way of avoiding redundancies in the Security Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para1"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, expressed his very real concern about putting on a statutory footing the surveillance work of the police. I repeat, yet again, what I have said on so many occasions: it is our intention to put it on a statutory footing. The noble Lord should not become too exercised about what would happen post-election. First, I expect that we shall still be here as the Government after the election. I know that irritates the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para2"></a>Even given what the noble Lord may be suggesting, I deduced from his remarks and from those of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, that they, too, regard it as very important to underpin police activities by means of legislation. It would be a priority for any of the parties coming into power. We intend that the issue will be addressed at an early opportunity. As I said, work is well in hand, and we will keep faith with that. From remarks made, I believe noble Lords opposite support that approach. I have no doubt that, at the time, there will be arguments and lively discussions about means to an end. However, I hope that we shall now allow the Bill to receive its Third Reading. I commend the Bill to the House.

<A NAME = "60708-21_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I am sure that the Minister is well aware that appearances are frequently deceptive. My noble friend Lady Hamwee and I have put down amendments dealing with the same point which appear to have opposite effects, but, in fact, are destined to achieve exactly the same end. We are concerned with subsection (1) of Clause 168, which requires local housing authorities to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"secure that advice and information about homelessness ... is available free of charge to any person in their district". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para9"></a>We both wanted to know what this clause meant. I approached that by a standard probing device of putting down an amendment to leave out the clause. My noble friend has approached it by the opposite route of laying down a more detailed specification of what it might include. We both wish to know what it does.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para10"></a>When I first saw this clause I must admit that I was reminded of the provision in the arrangements for the Social Fund, which deals with those who are held to be too poor to receive any assistance from the Social Fund. They are, instead, given money advice. I have always wondered what use that provision was to anybody. I am slightly more reassured about that as we have gone through the Bill, but I should like to be reassured that it does mean something a little more helpful than that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para11"></a>I am reminded of an occasion when I was a first year postgraduate, and I asked for information which was available, as I subsequently discovered, in one of the standard works of reference. My supervisor told me, "There is a book in the Bodleian". It was some time before I discovered that book. Similarly, if one were to tell homeless people, "There is housing available in Tower Hamlets", it might be quite some time before they discovered that housing. That is why I should like to know that something a little more specific than what I was offered by my supervisor is offered to the homeless under this clause. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, instead of allowing my noble friend Lord Russell to act as the curtain-raiser, I wonder whether I should leave it as a sort of one-act show. The purpose of my amendment, Amendment No. 39 in this group, is to highlight the importance of the availability of services being made widely known. I propose that there should be independent and comprehensive advice, which is not only valuable in itself, but often necessary as a check on local authorities--I say that with my local authority background--to tackle the root causes of homelessness. There are many causes and complex inter-relationships of causes. It is a tool for developing a more strategic approach to the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para12"></a>The duty proposed in the Bill does not specify that at least an element of independent advice should be included and the duty of local authorities should not be restricted to advice which seeks to prevent homelessness--although that in itself is important--but should address the strategic problem of housing insecurity by providing comprehensive housing advice. Independent advice is good because it should be accessible to those who need it. I include owner occupiers and tenants in the private rented sector. It is more accessible than perhaps a statutory service may <P>


<a name="column_85"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be able to provide and relevant to those groups--owner occupiers and tenants in the private sector--who may not regard the local authority as a likely source of assistance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para13"></a>I mentioned the need for a check on the quality of local authority decision-making. That has been the thrust of many of our amendments over the two stages of the Bill. I believe too--again either with the benefit of my local authority background or despite it--that independent advice can often provide very good value for money. It may perhaps lend itself more than statutory advice to the settlement of disputes. We are in an age in which mediation and reconciliation are regarded as more important than perhaps they were some years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para14"></a>I believe that the department supports independent advice. It has funded the national homelessness advice service. The interim report by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, on access to justice recognises the importance of independent advice. In another place the Minister said that an amendment to that effect was unnecessary and would be an additional cost to local authorities. However, although I should like to go along with the underlying notion that all local authorities carry out good practice, I fear, sadly, that that is not the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para15"></a>The amendment is based on parallel provisions in the Children Act. It is not clear why the provisions were necessary there, or at any rate acceptable, but here they are unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I support both amendments, Amendments Nos. 38 and 39, which are grouped together, using them to make a point that we have not discussed elsewhere in the Bill. It is a point to which we may wish to return on Third Reading. It is the problem of homelessness which faces those owner occupiers in the private sector mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee--those who face repossession for all kinds of reasons but who, by definition, will not currently be on the waiting list. Most other forms of housing need, if one is in private rented accommodation or the like, put one in a position to go on a housing waiting list. No local authority will accept an owner occupier on a waiting list unless there are very strong medical grounds for a change of housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para16"></a>It seems to me that we could reasonably ask local authorities to pursue rather more vigorously ways in which they can help someone facing repossession to retain his home, if not necessarily his tenure. That would mean not so much a rent-to-mortgages scheme (as when the Government pushed us so hard in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill) but that local authorities should seek to establish wherever possible a mortgages-to-rent scheme. I shall not go into the matter in any great detail tonight. It may be that we shall come back to it at Third Reading. But, given all the alterations in income support arrangements, of which Ministers on the Government Front Bench will be well aware, there is for many, particularly those who are bad insurance risks by virtue of their occupation--insecure; contract; part-time; flexible; based on commission or whatever--real difficulty in being able to retain their home.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para17"></a>I know that mortgages-to-rent schemes are not easy, especially when arrears remain as a debt. But, given the problem of negative equity, the sale of the property is not an easy option either. Also, given that there is not a low income mortgage support scheme, owner occupiers need a route into housing benefit if they are to remain in the same home and there bring up their children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para18"></a>I understand that there are good examples of mixed tenure--part renting, part owning--in the social housing sector under the Joseph Rowntree Trust and other housing associations. I believe that some building societies, for example, Bradford and Bingley, have an excellent record in helping people remain in occupation of the house through a mortgages-to-rent scheme and making possible staircasing down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para19"></a>I use the amendment as a hook to raise the issue. It struck me that at no stage in all our discussions have we considered the situation of an owner occupier faced with homelessness who, by definition, until the point of homelessness, was unable to go on the housing waiting list. It is important that local authorities should be encouraged, under the advice and assistance rubric, actively to enter discussions with building societies to see to what extent they can promote mortgages-to-rent schemes in their localities.

<A NAME="60708-21_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I was fascinated to see the noble Earl, Lord Russell, table an amendment to leave out subsection (1) and his noble friend Lady Hamwee put down an amendment to keep in subsection (1) and add a lot of things to it. I do not know whether or not noble Lords on the Liberal Democratic Benches talk to each other but on these Benches we always try, as the expression goes, to sing from the same hymn sheet. Anyhow, they have introduced two amendments which are totally different and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said that she wanted to support both. So she rather indelicately sits astride the hedge and waits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para20"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, tabled his amendment obviously from his frustrated experience as an undergraduate when he was told by his tutor to go down to the Bodleian and find a book there. I suppose that is the way you are taught if you go to Oxford. Some people who go to other places are taught differently. I can assure the noble Earl that times have moved on since 1868 and different practices occur.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para21"></a>The level of advice and assistance that is available to a person who may be experiencing, or is about to experience, a housing crisis varies throughout the country. Some authorities already provide good advisory services, but recent research that we commissioned showed clearly that provision is patchy overall.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para22"></a>We want to ensure that people are properly informed and to do that we must ensure that they have access to proper advice. In that way we can help prevent people becoming homeless in the first place. Research shows that timely housing advice can prevent homelessness by enabling a particular problem to be tackled in good time or an alternative housing solution to be found before a crisis develops. This new duty will ensure that people everywhere have the benefit of a good advisory service.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para23"></a>It will be for each authority to decide the precise issues and areas that the services should cover. Different areas will require different types and levels of service. The revised Homelessness Code of Guidance to Local Authorities when it is issued will cover that matter, but we would not want to dictate from central government exactly how the services should be provided.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para24"></a>Authorities will not have to provide the advice themselves, although they may if they want to do so. They can invite other agencies to act as the provider. In many areas there will already be established organisations which provide housing advice services, and the authority may want to harness existing expertise to provide the service which is required under the new duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para25"></a>Amendment No. 39, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, seeks to insert a new subsection into Clause 168, requiring authorities to publish and disseminate information about services they provide, either directly or indirectly, and to take steps to ensure that those who might benefit from the services receive that information. I understand the concern of the noble Baroness in tabling this amendment. However, I do not believe that it is necessary. The imposition of a specific requirement to publicise and disseminate advisory services would be burdensome on local authorities. Moreover, it would require the Government to be prescriptive about how it should be done. We would have to tell them what to do and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, would not like that--he does not like the Government telling people what to do. We do not wish to be prescriptive: we wish to retain flexibility, so that authorities may decide what is appropriate in each case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para26"></a>It is clearly in an authority's own interests to ensure that its services are brought to the attention of people in its area, in particular to help reduce the number of homelessness applications. But we do not believe it is necessary to put the requirement on the face of the Bill. We have repeatedly made clear that the revised guidance will cover advisory services, and I believe that is the right vehicle by which to persuade authorities of the benefits of publicising their services.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para27"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked whether the advice should be independent and whether it should extend to owner occupiers and private tenants. It is for a local authority to decide what to do. Many will support independent advice either by grant or by contract. There is no reason why the advice should not extend to owner occupiers and tenants and why it should not be independent. That, too, is a matter for local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para28"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, raised the question of mortgage-to-rent schemes. It is important, if unnecessary repossessions are to be avoided, that borrowers who are in difficulty should have access to sound advice and good counselling at the earliest possible stage. It is often the fact that borrowers in difficulty have multiple debt problems; it is not just the borrowing, there are other problems as well. The advice that they are given often needs to reflect a <P>


<a name="column_88"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wide range of problems as well as the procedures, benefit entitlements and possible escape routes. There is therefore a need for co-operation and co-ordinated action by the main agencies involved in order to ensure that the borrowers who are in difficulty receive effective advice and the support that they require to meet their needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para29"></a>A joint working group of the Council of Mortgage Lenders and local authority associations found that that co-ordination can be achieved through local arrears fora which are set up by the local authority and can include representatives of mortgage lenders, local advice agencies and the benefits agencies. A number of local authorities have already set up those fora and the Government recommend that other authorities should follow suit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para30"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned in particular mortgage-to-rent schemes. Those are one of a range of measures operated by lenders with the help of housing associations, local authorities and others in order to avoid repossessions. Mortgage-to-rent schemes have been used successfully, notably by the Bradford & Bingley Building Society. I agree with the noble Baroness that those schemes and other mortgage rescue operations should be welcomed. Local arrears fora, which are run by local authorities, are well placed to assist with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-21_para31"></a>To encapsulate my response: the amendments are unnecessary.

<A NAME="60708-22_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, my amendment and that of my noble friend Lady Hamwee work well together. Mine was meant to be the advance reconnaissance party, sent out to probe the enemy's advance. I probed and found it non-existent. My noble friend's amendment was meant to be the main body of our forces, brought along to go through the gap.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para0"></a>I asked the Minister what the clause would mean in practice. The Minister told me, if words mean anything at all, that he really does not know. Immediately afterwards he told my noble friend that her amendment is unnecessary. He can perfectly well have one of those propositions; I do not see how he can have both. If he does not know what will be done under the clause, how can he know that my noble friend's amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para1"></a>I thought the Minister might make a great virtue on this amendment of not wanting to be prescriptive. It is strange how eager the Government are to be prescriptive when it is a matter of stopping other people from doing things and how reluctant they are to be prescriptive when it may be a matter of offering some urgently needed help. We on these Benches take the duty to supply advice very seriously. My honourable friend Mrs. Maddock in another place was responsible for strengthening the provision before us. I am glad that she did so. We would like to do more of this. We would like real advice to be available and, as my noble friend said, we would like that advice to be independent. I do not see that we have got that here.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para6"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this is another probing operation. It deals with the requirement to offer assistance in obtaining accommodation. Again, I tabled a probing amendment to leave out the requirement in the hope of persuading the noble Earl to tell me exactly what it means.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para7"></a>"Assistance" can mean all kinds of things. It can mean anything from what I quoted just now down to a detailed list of addresses, rents and so forth. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, reminded us earlier, assistance for people with special needs may have to be extremely specialised and well informed if it is to work. Indeed, for people with limited mobility the need for advice to avoid them going all around The Wrekin looking in the wrong place may be extremely important.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para8"></a>We need to know what is meant by "assistance" before we can decide whether it is worthwhile. Both advice and assistance, if they are to soften the apparently harsh outlines of Part VII of the Bill--Ministers have often urged us to think that they do soften those harsh outlines--will need to be reasonably precise. One cannot soften things with hot air. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I wish to speak to this group of amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, mentioned earlier that there are some interesting groupings: this may be one of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para9"></a>Amendment No. 41 stands in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham. It is an amendment to Clause 173 proposing a presumption of eligibility. It proposes that the authorities, in establishing eligibility under Clause 174 which deals with persons from abroad, shall,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"satisfy themselves, if the applicant is eligible for assistance, whether any duty, and if so what duty, is owed to him under the following provisions of this Part". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para10"></a>As drafted the Bill allows authorities to make such inquiries as are necessary to satisfy themselves whether a person is "eligible for assistance". It will be based on immigration status. Other noble Lords have far more experience than I do of the arcane provisions of this part of the law. It is enough to say that it is complex and, having taken part in the spectator sport of the debate on the application of certain provisions, it is certainly safe to say that housing officers are not likely to find it straightforward to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para11"></a>They cannot be expected to be familiar with immigration law and practice. The applicant's immigration status will be a major factor. The groups who will be excluded include, of course, illegal entrants, people given temporary admission and those given <P>


<a name="column_90"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>limited leave on the basis of having no recourse to public funds; people who fail the habitual residence test, as well as the asylum seekers. The experience of the habitual residence test in housing and income support cases suggests that the test is applied in different ways in different authorities and within authorities. This is a matter that has been referred to at an earlier stage of this Bill. The factors to be assessed include the length and continuity of residence, future intentions, employment prospects and others. As I say, it is not straightforward.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para12"></a>The amendment is not a weaker test. It proposes that unless there is full evidence of ineligibility based on fact, the local authority cannot refuse assistance. It may be more onerous to establish ineligibility, but that will only arise in certain cases because the majority of applicants will be eligible. It differs from the proposed test where the authority has to satisfy itself that the applicant is eligible and therefore would have to subject every applicant to the test. The test that this amendment proposes would ensure that people are not refused assistance where they are eligible, but would achieve what I understand to be the Government's intention of excluding people who are not eligible. It is particularly important in that the amendment would avoid the scope for discrimination, which would almost certainly arise under the current test where housing officers need only satisfy themselves about a person's status.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I have made clear on a number of occasions that the Government attach great importance to ensuring that persons from abroad who do not have a valid claim to assistance under the homelessness legislation should not have access to it. As far as that assistance is concerned, it is pretty clearly explained in Clause 172. Just before the portion which the noble Earl would like to be removed from the Bill through his amendment, the clause refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'assistance under this Part' means the benefit of any duty under the following provisions of this Part relating to accommodation or assistance in obtaining accommodation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
So the assistance that we are referring to is the assistance which is described in the rest of Part VII of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para13"></a>What we are attempting to do in this part of the Bill, and in one or two other parts of the Bill still to be considered, is to ensure that those who do not have a valid claim for assistance under the homelessness legislation should not have access to it. Therefore, it will be necessary for authorities to make sure that applicants are eligible for the assistance they seek. That is why the Bill is drafted as it is. Clause 173(1) requires authorities,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to satisfy themselves whether [an applicant] is eligible for assistance". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
This is a prerequisite if we are to be sure that costly assistance provided at the expense of the national taxpayers and the local council taxpayers is not exploited by those who are not entitled to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para14"></a>Amendment No. 41 would undermine this aim by removing the requirement for authorities to satisfy themselves whether applicants are eligible for assistance <P>


<a name="column_91"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under Part VII. Indeed, authorities would need only to make such inquiries as were necessary to establish whether applicants were ineligible for assistance. That changes the onus.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para15"></a>It might be argued that the effect of the amendment is a little different from what is currently drafted in the Bill. In that case your Lordships may wonder why we should be invited to make this change since I do not believe that it clarifies the authority's duty in this area. I believe that, if anything, the amendment seems to replace what is a very clear provision with something which is much more vague and, consequently, it is unhelpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para16"></a>Some of your Lordships have previously expressed concern that housing authorities will find it onerous to have to consider a person's eligibility, which in effect will mean probing his immigration status. If I understood the second contribution from the Liberal Democrat Benches from the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that is what she was discussing, at least in part.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para17"></a>I have said on a number of previous occasions that authorities already have to take into account the immigration status of homeless applicants following the Court of Appeal's decision in 1993 in the Tower Hamlets case. That concerned applicants who had entered the country illegally or who had overstayed their leave to remain. No duty under the homelessness legislation is owed in either case. Following that decision, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment issued a revised homelessness code of guidance to local authorities concerning applications from persons outside the United Kingdom, including a model screening procedure for making inquiries about immigration status in a sensitive and non-discriminatory way. Indeed, I believe that I have spoken at greater length about the revised homelessness code on previous occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para18"></a>That guidance also makes clear that information about an applicant's immigration status can be obtained by local authorities from the Immigration and Nationality Department at the Home Office, if that is necessary. We intend to issue a revised guidance on handling these aspects of homelessness applications when the provisions in Part VII come into force. It is important that authorities are under a clear obligation to determine whether a homeless applicant is eligible for assistance as part of their inquiries to satisfy themselves whether any duty is owed under Part VII.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-22_para19"></a>Amendment No. 41 would undermine the provisions in the Bill which provide for that. Amendment No. 40 would remove the definition of "eligible for assistance" in Clause 172. As I have already said, the concept of eligibility is an important one. It is a thread which runs right through Part VII of the Bill. The removal of the definition would be neither helpful nor desirable. With that explanation of how the system will work, and perhaps the reference to some other speeches that I have <P>


<a name="column_92"></a>

<P>
<A NAME="60708-23_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Of course, he is not the only one who has made other speeches. The Minister may remember a number of debates on amendments moved by his noble friend Lady O'Cathain which were concerned with the pressures on airlines of trying to judge immigration status. That case was very well made out and it was extremely persuasive. I was happy to support it. Some small part of that case has now been heard and I am glad that it has. But I do not believe that local authorities are any more competent to judge immigration status than are the airlines--indeed, they are possibly slightly less able because airlines inevitably have some knowledge of traffic from country to country whereas local authorities, by their very definition, very often do not.

<A NAME = "60708-23_para0"></a>So if one of these cases has prevailed and the other has not, I do not believe that it is because of the superior intellectual merits of the one which has prevailed. In saying that I do not in any way wish to denigrate the case which has been made on behalf of British Airways, with which I agree.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para1"></a>As for my own amendment, the Minister reminded me very vividly of an exchange which took place in another place in, I believe, 1956, between Mr. Aneurin Bevan and the right honourable Alan Lennox-Boyd. Aneurin Bevan asked when it would be appropriate to give Cyprus independence. The Minister said, "At the appropriate moment". He was asked, "What is the appropriate moment?" and the Minister replied, "The appropriate moment is the appropriate moment". The Minister has told me that "assistance under this Bill" is assistance under this Bill. I shall read what he said carefully to see whether I can find anything else in it. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60708-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 42:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 105, line 14, at end insert--
<BR>
(" ( ) If the authority are satisfied that other suitable accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant and have a duty under section 185 they shall at the same time notify him of the address of the dwelling-house which they are satisfied is available for his occupation.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, government Amendment No. 71 is grouped with my amendment, Amendment No. 42. My amendment, which is very specific, is the vehicle for asking precisely how the Government expect that a local housing authority will exercise its duty and, in particular, how we can expect accommodation to be suitable for an applicant if no specific address is in mind. That links to government Amendment No. 71 and allows me to ask what is meant by subsection (3) which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The duty ceases if the applicant fails to take reasonable steps to secure such accommodation". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_93"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I believe that "accommodation" is used there in the general sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para6"></a>My amendment deals with specific accommodation, and suggests that an applicant should be directed to a specific property which is both suitable and available. Without having the address of the property, the applicant would not be able to challenge a decision involving advice and assistance under Clause 185. It would not be possible to challenge the fact that the accommodation may be unsuitable without particular accommodation being in issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para7"></a>Perhaps I may give one example. A private landlord may own a block of flats which may generally be available to people on benefits. However, to take the sort of example which the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has rightly been using, an applicant may be directed to that block in which a ground floor flat may be "appropriate"--with apologies to Aneurin Bevan and Mr. Lennox-Boyd--but the particular flat on offer may be on a higher floor and may not be accessible to someone with mobility problems. If the authority merely has to indicate that "accommodation" (in a general sense) is available, accommodation may not really be "available"--in the normal understanding of that word--to that applicant because the accommodation on offer may be unsuitable for him and he may then be unable to secure any accommodation. My amendment is designed to link a property to an applicant and vice versa. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I should like to take this opportunity to thank my noble friend for tabling Amendment No. 71 which I suspect is in response to an amendment that I moved in Committee. Amendment No. 71 goes nearly all the way to meeting what I wanted. Indeed, it is so close that I do not think that it makes a great deal of difference but, as I said earlier, as a result of the tabling of Amendment No. 71, I shall not be moving Amendment No. 73, which was designed purely to make certain that the Government came up to scratch.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-23_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for tabling an amendment to ensure that the Government come up to scratch. I cannot see why on earth he thought that it was necessary to do such a thing--the Government always come up to scratch.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para8"></a>I was fascinated by the anecdote given by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, about Aneurin Bevan and Lennox-Boyd. The noble Earl said that Lennox-Boyd said that Cyprus would be given independence "at the appropriate moment" and, when asked what the "appropriate moment" was, said, "The appropriate moment means the appropriate moment". I remember one of his colleagues giving a different answer when asked when Cyprus would be given independence. He said "Never". That was Mr. Henry Hopkinson who later became Lord Colyton and, for that minor indiscretion, he found himself in the Foreign Office for not too long. That is why Ministers sometimes choose their words <P>


<a name="column_94"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>very carefully. I shall endeavour to choose my words with equal care this evening so that I shall not suffer the same fate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para9"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has moved her amendment, Amendment No. 42. My amendment is Amendment No. 71 and I hope that the noble Baroness will not think it totally discourteous of me if I explain my amendment first because, when I have done so, I think that the noble Baroness will see how her amendment does or does not fit in.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para10"></a>Concerns were expressed by a number of noble Lords during Committee stage that the provisions in Clause 185 did not offer sufficient protection. Some noble Lords, in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, felt that the provisions might allow a let-out for less scrupulous authorities. In response to the noble Baroness, my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish said that it was our intention to put forward amendments for consideration on Report which would clarify the level of advice and assistance which was expected of local authorities. Since Committee stage, officials have been discussing with Shelter and the local authority associations possible measures to clarify the nature of the duty. Amendment No. 71 delivers the result. I thought that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would be delighted, just as my noble friend Lord Swinfen has said that he is.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para11"></a>Amendment No. 71 makes it clear that an authority must be satisfied that the advice and assistance it has provided is sufficient to enable the applicant to secure accommodation. This amendment strengthens the provisions in Clause 185, while ensuring that the applicant takes some responsibility for arranging his own accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para12"></a>Clause 185 is an important provision: it is a halfway stage between the full homelessness duty and the purely advisory role. In order for this provision to work, it is important for the applicant to play his part in finding a solution. By encouraging people to take some responsibility for finding their own housing, Amendment No. 71 preserves the role of the individual. At the same time, it will give people the confidence that they will be given proper support in their endeavours.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para13"></a>The provisions in Clause 185 provide a practical way in which applicants can help themselves without having to place themselves entirely at the mercy of the local authority. Amendment No. 71 strengthens those provisions. That is the position with regard to my amendment. Amendment No. 42, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would require a much increased involvement of the local authority in securing the alternative accommodation for the applicant. By requiring an authority to give the applicant the address of the property which it is satisfied is available, the amendment could come close to placing a duty on the authority actually to do the whole job of securing the accommodation for the applicant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para14"></a>There will be a number of ways in which an authority can provide the necessary advice and assistance for the applicant. In some cases this may involve identifying a particular property which it knows to be available, but in others the authority may establish links with a <P>


<a name="column_95"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>landlord who has a range of property, or with a letting agent. It may refer the applicant to that landlord (or agent) and leave them to sort out which of the properties in the landlord's portfolio the applicant is to take. Were the amendment to apply, that sort of process would not be possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para15"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether accommodation (in the general sense) has merely to be available. The answer is no; the accommodation must reflect the applicant's personal characteristics. That is explained in subsection (4)(a) which is introduced by our Amendment No. 71. The noble Baroness asked how an applicant can challenge whether alternative accommodation is suitable and available if the local authority does not specify the actual address. It is understood in the phrase "alternative accommodation" that there is a duty under Clause 185 which is not discharged if suitable accommodation is not actually secured, unless the applicant has failed to take reasonable steps to secure it himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para16"></a>I think it is necessary to ensure that the applicant does take reasonable steps to ensure these things. He ought to have advice and help from the local authority but he cannot be removed entirely from the responsibility of doing it. It would be wrong if he were, because it would or could place quite intolerable burdens on the local authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-23_para17"></a>I would end by saying that Amendment No. 71, which is in my name, prevents the authorities from taking an unreasonably short-term view of what constitutes suitable alternative accommodation, but at the same time it places some responsibility on the applicant to take up the opportunities which are provided to him. I think that a provision like that is preferable to an open-ended duty of the kind proposed by the noble Baroness. That is why, in a spirit of total modesty, I suggest that my amendment might be better than that of the noble Baroness.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to ask the Minister two questions. The first refers to his amendment. He has directed your Lordships to subsection 4(a) which requires the authority to have regard to all the circumstances, including the characteristics and personal circumstances of the applicant. Can the Minister help me and perhaps others of your Lordships by saying what is meant by the word "characteristics"? Is that something different from need? Secondly, as regards my amendment, I am still unclear--and perhaps the Minister can give me a short answer--how, if the authority is not aware of the address of a property, it can know that it is suitable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-24_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the first of the noble Baroness's questions, the characteristics and personal circumstances of the applicant are exactly what they are said to be, to repeat the advice of Alan Lennox-Boyd. He said, if I might transpose this, that the characteristics and personal circumstances of the applicant mean the characteristics and personal circumstances of the applicant. In other words, a person has certain characteristics; his requirements and needs <P>


<a name="column_96"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are of a certain nature. I have used before as an example the extreme case of a person who may be a single parent with five children, and she has certain characteristics and certain circumstances to which the housing provisions have to be made appropriate. You can find other examples among those who may be disabled, mentally ill or tied down by children. These are all the characteristics of the applicant and they must be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para0"></a>The property will be suitable if in practice it meets the needs of the applicant. I cannot go any further than that, and I am sure the noble Baroness will understand why. The purpose is to ensure that a housing situation meets the needs of a particular applicant, and the needs of one applicant are different from those of another. It is the characteristics of a particular applicant which determine whether or not the housing which is available is appropriate to that applicant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I will think about this and perhaps put down an amendment at Third Reading to change "characteristics" to "needs". I remain concerned about this because if an applicant cannot find secure alternative accommodation he will re-apply, and so we are faced with a fast-revolving door. It would be churlish not to acknowledge that the Government have moved, even if not quite as far as I personally would have wished. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-24_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>   moved Amendment No. 43:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 105, line 27, at end insert--
<BR>
("provided always that no British subject shall be deemed to be, a person from abroad.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para3"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, perhaps I may be forgiven if for a moment I thank the Minister for introducing the case of the late Lord Colyton, formerly Mr. Hopkinson. I remember it well: Mr. Lennox-Boyd was clearing up the mess it created. By coincidence, one of my academic colleagues happened to have read in the Public Record Office, where it is now in the public domain, the brief from which Mr. Hopkinson spoke. Though it did not say "never", the word "never" was written in the margin and he made the mistake of reading it out. The conclusion I have drawn from this story, and of which I become more and more convinced, is that "never" is a short time in politics.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para4"></a>This amendment deals with subsection (1) of Clause 174, which provides that a person from abroad shall not be eligible for housing assistance. My amendment seeks to provide that a British subject shall not be taken to be a person from abroad. One would have thought that that amendment might have been a tautology, but sadly at present it is not. Some of your Lordships may have noticed in the  Independent a few days ago a report of the case of Mr. Hussein. Anyone who was aware of what was going on at Trent Bridge on Saturday must realise that "Hussein" (however spelt) is now a good English name. This particular Mr. Hussein is a British subject resident in Kuwait and <P>


<a name="column_97"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>married to a Kuwaiti by whom he has children. Mr. Hussein has been converted away from Islam. He has been found guilty of apostasy. He has been sentenced to separate from his wife and children and he faces the prospect of a death sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para5"></a>As you might expect, British consular staff are involved in trying to procure Mr. Hussein's safety. In any normal circumstances, with any normal country with a dedication to protecting the interests of its own subjects, one would have thought that the advice given to Mr. Hussein might have been to go home to his own country where he has his own citizenship. But were Mr. Hussein do so he would not of course instantly be employed. Neither would he be able to obtain benefits because under the habitual residence test he would be found to be a person from abroad. To be found to be a person from abroad in your own country really is a peculiarly sadistic form of insult. It is entirely unnecessary, and deprives people of rights which everybody ought to have in a country somewhere. If by any misfortune one ceases to be able to enjoy those rights in one's own country, one ought to be able to enjoy them in another; but he has done nothing to justify being deprived of them in the country of his citizenship.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para6"></a>Mr. Hussein is not alone in this case. The British have always been a travelling people. That has been in our interest, as it has from time to time been in the interests of the other places to which we have gone. One thinks of people who may be wishing, for example, to return from Liberia, where they may have been working as doctors or teachers; but if they return destitute--maybe turned out by the burning down of their house--to their own country where they should have been able to come in safety, they find they are turned away as persons from abroad. I really do not understand why the Government do this. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, may be pleased to hear that only this morning I telephoned the Kuwaiti Embassy on behalf of Mr. Hussein, about whom he was speaking. However, as somebody who was involved, with many others, in the development of housing aid and advice in the 1960s, both before and after the creation of the body known as Shelter, I read with some encouragement the terms of Clause 168. The clause provides that every local housing authority shall secure that advice and information is available free of charge to any person in its district. The clause goes on to repeat the phrase "any person" no less than three times. Therefore, it is a source of grave disappointment to read further on in Clauses 173 and 174 that the duties in respect of both homelessness and other forms of housing assistance are being whittled away from any person in the district and are being made subject to all kinds of tests and discrimination.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para7"></a>I should warn the Government that if they continue to make things so difficult for local housing authorities in respect of asylum seekers and refugees it will be incumbent on them to make proper housing provision for such people. This will become a function of central government, as it has been made almost impossible for local government to deal with the question.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, in this amendment in this part of the Bill we are not talking about asylum seekers or refugees. They have been covered in other parts of the debate, and we will probably come to them later. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that anyone who seeks asylum on his arrival in this country is eligible for benefits and to be considered under the homelessness legislation. The noble Lord refers to advice which is available to any person. Under Clause 168 the advisory services are fully open to persons from abroad to help prevent homelessness. The difference is that assistance under the homelessness legislation--which means finding a house and perhaps providing one--is not available because that must accord with, and be parallel to, the person's eligibility for housing benefit. I know that the noble Lord does not agree with the Government as to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para8"></a>I believe that as a country the United Kingdom is reasonably generous to people seeking asylum. If they claim asylum at the port of entry most assuredly the benefits system will be open to them until a decision is made one way or the other by the Home Office. As far as concerns the habitual residence test, the noble Earl and I have been over this on a number of occasions. I suspect that we will never come to agreement. Although I normally obey the rule never to say "never" in politics, I believe that in this case it can be said with some safety. The noble Earl appreciates that United Kingdom citizens along with other people from the European Union are caught by the habitual residence test simply because of the rules of the European Union. Under those rules, we cannot differentiate between our citizens and other citizens of the European Union. To devise a rule to prevent people coming here and claiming benefits to which they have little or no entitlement we have had to introduce the habitual residence test. That must cover people from abroad. It applies equally to British citizens, EU citizens and settled immigrants. The noble Earl knows that that is the position. That was designed to combat abuse of our benefits system.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-24_para9"></a>Listening to the noble Earl, your Lordships may have thought that we would turn people away at the front door. That is not so. Of course they are British citizens, but if they have not been habitually resident here should they be immediately entitled to these benefits just as if they had been here all their lives? I do not believe that that should be so. The noble Earl does not agree. He believes that if such a person comes here, regardless of how tenuous his links may be to this country, as long as he is a British citizen he ought to be eligible immediately for all the benefits that those of us who have lived in this country all our lives are entitled to. That is a point of view. It does not happen to be my point of view, and I do not believe that it is the view of the majority of taxpayers. I accept that there are some taxpayers, like the noble Earl, who have no problem <P>

<A NAME="60708-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say whether a person with a British passport, who is entitled to enter and live in this country but who happens to have lived abroad, is able to come to Britain as an asylum seeker?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, that is a neat question, to which the answer is no. The simple reason--which I thought would be obvious to anybody--is that if that person holds a British passport he is allowed to stay in this country. The question is whether such a person is immediately entitled to British benefit. I do not believe that he ought to be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister saying that someone who claims asylum at the port of entry but who is not a British citizen is entitled to British benefits but that a British citizen who is under threat of persecution and applies for asylum at the port of entry, as in the case outlined by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, is not entitled to British benefits?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I thought that we were discussing homelessness and housing assistance, not benefit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to say that we are talking about benefits because the two are tied together. If people have lots of money they will not need to be considered under the homelessness legislation. If they do not have lots of money they will need either housing benefit or the local authority to pay for them. They will need benefit from the British taxpayer or the British council tax payer one way or another.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, if a British citizen goes to live in Australia his pension is frozen at whatever the rate is at the time. If that person returns to this country the pension is immediately reinstated at the current rate. I know a number of people who regularly return to England in order to have their pensions upgraded. I wonder how that affects this issue. I am sorry to put a fly in the ointment in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend will know, if a person is entitled to a British pension he will have paid contributions while resident in the United Kingdom. The pension rules allow such an individual to come back and establish himself here, receive an upgrade of pension and then return to Australia--if he must. The pension is then frozen again. However, that is an entirely different issue. The noble Baroness may laugh but I would just like to get it on record that I presume the Labour Party will repeal the habitual residence test if it wins the election and will allow people to come here from wherever it is in the world and link themselves in to the United Kingdom benefit system--whatever that may cost the British <P>


<a name="column_100"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>taxpayer. I presume that is the Labour Party's policy. I certainly know it is the Liberal Democrats' policy because the noble Earl has told me on a number of occasions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister asked me a question. I am delighted to see that he is practising for the position of Opposition by interrogating noble Lords on these Benches as to the implications of our policies. I am sure he will get even further practice of that in future. I simply asked him a question which he may go on to answer but I think he thought he had passed by our point. Why is it acceptable that someone coming out of a situation, as outlined by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, in Kuwait or Iran who is not a British citizen would be entitled to means-tested benefits but someone who is a British citizen coming out of the same situation of persecution would not be entitled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, your Lordships will have noticed that the noble Baroness evaded the question about what the Labour Party's policy would be. I presume that means that it does not have a policy. Maybe it is under review. Or perhaps there is to be a referendum on it. I must conclude that the Labour Party would be prepared to allow all the people we are excluding from benefit to have access to the benefit again. If that is the case, then, in accordance with what I will call the "Brown doctrine", savings will have to be found elsewhere in the British benefit system in order to pay benefits to people from abroad and asylum seekers, presumably, who come here saying they will not live off the British taxpayer and then, when they get here, decide to claim asylum. All that money will have to be found from elsewhere in the social security budget. I imagine that means that other British citizens will have to lose some of their benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para0"></a>I am asked the question about British citizens. I am afraid the noble Lords opposite are becoming confused. All we are discussing with the habitual residence test is whether or not a person who is not an habitual resident here, including an EU citizen--because we must remember that they can be EU citizens as well as British citizens--has a right immediately to claim United Kingdom benefits. We say they should not have. The Opposition clearly say they should. What is the difference between a returning British citizen and an asylum seeker? The difference is that a returning British citizen is immediately entitled to go to work. He does not need to wait for the six months. There are no problems about working immediately he reaches this country. Therefore, if the gentleman from Kuwait comes here, he can use his undoubted talents to start work immediately. He is in quite a different situation from an asylum seeker who, of course, is not allowed to work until at least six months have passed in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para1"></a>We look for a number of factors in deciding whether somebody is habitually resident: a claimant's future intentions, the reasons for his coming to the UK, his employment record, and the continuity of residence in another country. All claimants are subject to the habitual residence test when making application for benefits. <P>


<a name="column_101"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is only fair that British subjects who may have lived abroad for a great many years--and in some of the examples we have had even retain property and interests abroad--should be required to establish whether they are habitually resident here when they wish to claim assistance provided by resident British taxpayers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para2"></a>As I explained to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, earlier, local authorities normally rely on housing benefit to defray a considerable part of the costs of their homelessness duty. Nevertheless, providing assistance under the homelessness legislation still involves them in expense. Were this amendment to be passed it would prevent our aligning entitlement under the homelessness legislation with entitlement to social security benefits and could result in an even greater cost to the local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para3"></a>I understand the noble Earl's concern about the habitual residence test. I understand that the noble Earl is opposed to it absolutely and that he would be prepared to live with what, when this issue first came to our attention, were called "benefit tourists".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-25_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is putting words into my mouth. He knows perfectly well that, like the Social Security Advisory Committee, I believe that the actively seeking work rules are much better designed to catch those people than the test. I ask him to withdraw the remark he has just made.

<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para4"></a>However, be that as it may, the position is that the habitual residence test is a clear test which must be applied to United Kingdom citizens returning here just as it must to European Union citizens and other people with settled status here. I believe that it is a perfectly sensible protection for the British taxpayer. I am sure that the majority of my fellow countrymen agree with me, although I accept that others do not. It seems to me that we should make sure that we use our benefit system and the considerable amount of money which the taxpayer entrusts to us to run that benefit system for the purpose for which it was intended; namely, to help those of our fellow citizens resident in this country who have fallen on hard times.

<A NAME="60708-25_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I really rather enjoyed that. I am grateful for the support that I received from all sides of the House. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for giving more information about the case of Mr. Hussein. I am grateful to those on the Opposition Front Bench for their extremely useful questions about the relationship between an asylum seeker and a British person suffering under the habitual residence test.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para5"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, for reminding us of the problem of the Australian resident pensioners. That is a serious problem <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>to which we must return. However, I fear that the noble Baroness was perhaps unwise to draw the Government's attention to the practice of people returning from Australia to up-rate their pensions. The Government will stop that next. If the noble Baroness wishes to join me in challenging them when they do that, I shall be happy to have her support.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para6"></a>Before moving the amendment, I should have declared a non-pecuniary interest because for a period of five years or more, I have twice been resident outside the United Kingdom. Therefore, if I had returned home destitute as a result of any misfortune, if it had been in place then, I would have been caught by this test. Therefore, when the Minister says that British subjects returning from abroad who are caught by this test have a very tenuous connection with this country, I find those words personally offensive and I should be grateful if the Minister would also withdraw that allegation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para7"></a>As always, the Minister had a great deal to say about the taxpayer, who is, of course, not singular. Of course the interests of taxpayers need to be taken into account but the Minister's success in doing that has not been very great, in particular in relation to the people whom we are considering. If they are denied benefit, they become homeless, destitute and probably patients in a hospital where they will be a charge on public funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para8"></a>But if they are able to obtain work--and hardly anybody can do so who is sleeping rough on the street--they will become taxpayers. The Minister knows perfectly well that that is the way in which I believe the interests of the taxpayer should be served.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-25_para9"></a>The Minister is right about our policy but he must not put into our mouths what he believes the consequences of that policy will be. We believe that he is very deeply mistaken in that calculation. I was very surprised by what the Minister said when he referred to the advice clause to which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, drew attention. The Minister said that persons from abroad will be entitled to advice about how to avoid homelessness. But when they are not entitled to work and have no money--

<A NAME="60708-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl really must not go on about not being entitled to work. If the people concerned are British citizens they will be entitled to work immediately on their return here. That is quite a different category from asylum seekers who are not British citizens.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. I had temporarily slipped a gear and I thank him for pulling me up.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para0"></a>The fact remains that even if you are entitled to work, not everybody who is so entitled is of an age and has the health which permits them to do so. The Minister will recall one particular case about which we have corresponded at very great length where that was definitely the case. Therefore, in those cases, I should be grateful to know precisely what advice those people will be given. I presume it will be the traditional Irish advice that they should not have started from here in the first place; but I do not know what else they should have done.

<A NAME = "60708-26_para1"></a>The noble Lord should also look very carefully at the judgment of Lord Justice Neill in the Kihara case in the Court of Appeal which drew attention to the combination of pressures that a number of people in that situation face.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para2"></a>Rather unwisely, I thought, in the context of previous discussions, the Minister told me that he would never agree with me about the habitual residence test. I must ask him the traditional question: what, never? There is an appropriate response; I hope he can give it. The Minister will go on about taxation. I think he is going the wrong way about it, but we shall not agree about that either, and we shall have plenty more opportunities to return to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 44:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 105, line 27, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) A person who is subject to immigration control within the meaning of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 is not eligible for housing assistance unless he is of a class prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 44 I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 47, 48 and 49. I believe I have already explained to your Lordships--in the context of moving amendments to Clause 153 of Part VI of the Bill, dealing with those who may or may not be a qualifying person for the purpose of housing allocation--that the Government are concerned to put beyond doubt the question of the lawfulness of excluding certain classes of persons subject to immigration control from entitlement to housing assistance. I remind your Lordships that this concern arises because of the recent Court of Appeal decision which stated that the regulations which we passed at the end of January were unlawful insofar as they deny council tax benefit, housing benefit or income support benefit to asylum seekers whose claim has not been finally determined.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para5"></a>Amendment No. 44 is similar to Government Amendment No. 7--which I moved earlier this evening--which has already been considered under Part VI. Amendment No. 44 will make clear on the face of the Bill that persons subject to immigration control are not eligible for assistance under Part VII, and will put beyond doubt--in primary legislation--that such persons are ineligible unless otherwise prescribed by regulations. Other than clarifying the issue of the lawfulness of any exclusions from eligibility under Part VII, the practical effect of this amendment is, like Amendment No. 7, nil because the classes of person which we intend to exclude from eligibility are unchanged.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para6"></a>We intend that regulations should specify that the following classes of person subject to immigration control are eligible for assistance under Part VII: refugees; persons granted exceptional leave to remain, or having indefinite leave to remain; asylum seekers (and the dependants of asylum seekers) whose asylum <P>


<a name="column_104"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>claim has not been turned down and who either applied for asylum at the port on arrival, or applied for asylum within three months of a declaration by the Home Secretary that their country of origin has undergone an upheaval. As with regulations to prescribe persons subject to immigration control who are qualifying persons for the purpose of Part VI, we intend that regulations prescribing those who are eligible for assistance under Part VII should be made at the outset, on commencement of this Bill. I commend the amendments to the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, it is of course confusing and difficult to have so many government amendments at this stage of the Bill. I am bound to say that it has been difficult to examine these amendments in the time available, to test whether they are innocuous or whether they contain a sting. I listened hard to what the Minister said in introducing these four amendments. The difficulty is that as we have two Bills proceeding through Parliament at the same time there is some overlap. I am bound to say that had the Government kept the housing provisions either in the asylum Bill only or in the Housing Bill only, it would have been much easier than having similar groups of people covered in both Bills. That has certainly caused me confusion, but I fear it has also caused the Government confusion, and that makes it worse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para7"></a>When the Minister talked about the people who would be eligible for assistance he did not mention asylum seekers who claimed asylum within three days of arrival in this country, as was established in a previous amendment. I do not wish to have too suspicious a mind about this, but I wonder whether Amendment No. 48, which seeks to remove subsection (3) of Clause 174, is intended in some way to circumvent that three-day amendment that this House accepted. It certainly could, on one construction, be seen to be doing that. I hope that is not the case because if it were I should have thought that it is not totally above board and is not the right way to take this matter further.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para8"></a>Regrettably, because we are dealing with the issue at Report stage and not in Committee, other than asking for leave of the House to make further interventions, it is much harder to establish the truth of the matter. That is another difficulty in having a raft of government amendments at this late stage of the Bill. I should like some assurance that nothing the Minister has said will, directly or indirectly, affect the amendment passed by this House: that asylum seekers claiming asylum within three days of arrival will have the same entitlements to benefits as those who claim asylum at the port of entry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has made an extremely important point. I, too, am anxious to hear the assurance for which he asks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, when the Minister replies will he explain to the House the meaning of the wording in Amendment No. 49, "whether another person". It does not seem plain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister read a list of categories of people who would be eligible. <P>


<a name="column_105"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>He referred again to the concept of an individual applying for asylum at the port of entry. My noble friend Lord Dubs queried whether the Government recognised that there was an amendment at Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para9"></a>Perhaps I may put another category to the Minister; he may not have considered it. A rich person comes from a country where he would be subject to persecution. There are special categories or criteria by which people with large amounts of wealth can come to this country without difficulties with immigration control, and so on. The wealthy person comes to this country but loses his wealth after being resident for some time. It may be a bad Stock Exchange investment--stocks can go down as well as up. He becomes destitute in this country with no visible means of support. Would the Government entertain an application for asylum for that person even though the application was not made within three days of arriving at the point of entry?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, as these are my amendments, I can sum up this short debate at Report stage. I do not believe that there is any problem about the procedure of the House. Therefore, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Dubs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para10"></a>I shall not pursue the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, down his hypothetical path. I am always intrigued at the manufacture of hypothetical cases. If a rich asylum seeker comes to this country, his asylum application will be treated in the same way as anyone else's and he will clearly not be eligible for benefit on any specific count even if he applies at the port of entry. So far as I am concerned, he will not be eligible for benefit, although one never knows the view of the Opposition parties on that. I gather that they would not consider him eligible for benefit either.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew8"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, he is an asylum seeker. I thought that asylum seekers were more deserving of benefit than anyone else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I believe that the Minister has misunderstood my comments. I was talking about someone who was rich and is now destitute. What is the Government's position?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-26_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord would give me a moment or two to answer. A person does not come to this country rich and in the twinkling of an eye suddenly become poor. After a few months of putting money on the wrong horse, or whatever it may be, he then ends up poor. I guess that by that time the asylum application would have been considered. If the person had been granted asylum or exceptional leave to remain and then became poor, he would be eligible for benefit. However, if he had not been granted asylum and became poor, he would be like anyone else not granted asylum: he would not be eligible for benefit. That is a pretty clear answer.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para11"></a>To return to more serious matters, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked about "whether another person", the words in my amendment. It is simply a re-drafting amendment with no practical change in effect from the provisions drafted in Clause 174 (4). With the assurance that there is nothing underhand or devious intended, I hope that the noble Lord can be comforted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para12"></a>Amendment No. 48 would remove subsection (3) of Clause 174. The subsection provides that regulations that prescribe classes of persons who are ineligible under Part VII may make reference to housing benefit legislation. While it remains our broad policy aim to align entitlement to assistance under the homelessness legislation with entitlement to housing benefit, we do not intend to make direct reference to social security legislation for the purpose of making regulations under Part VII. That is the position.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-26_para13"></a>As to the three days, nothing takes away from the general principle of aligning the benefit regulations with the asylum provisions which apply at the port of arrival. I have mentioned before that we are considering what we should do about the defeat which I suffered a week ago in your Lordships' House.

(" ( ) Nothing in subsection (1) above shall render ineligible under this Part any claimant pursuing an appeal under the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment stands in my name and that of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and with it I wish to speak to Amendment No. 46. I should not have tabled the amendment if I had not listened to and then read carefully the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, at the Report stage of the Asylum and Immigration Bill. I found his answer so unsatisfactory that I thought it appropriate, on a more limited basis, to put this amendment forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para1"></a>I wish to make two points. First, I shall deal with the point that the noble Lord made about equating benefit entitlement for asylum seekers with the same system of benefit entitlement for normal UK residents. The Minister said that, while an appeal is taking place, a UK resident does not receive benefit and the situation is similar with asylum seekers. However, the point is different; it has been made before but must be repeated. If a UK resident is held not to be entitled to a particular benefit and chooses to appeal, the appeal is based on the decision to refuse the benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para2"></a>In the case of an asylum seeker who is turned down by the Home Office in his asylum claim, if he appeals and then has his benefit stopped, the appeal is not about entitlement to benefit but the right to asylum. Yet, if the Government have their way, the asylum seeker will lose his benefit while the appeal is going on. It is because the subject of the appeal is different that it is not straightforward and not fair to equate the two processes. It is not right to say that one is treating all people equally.
<P>


<a name="column_107"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para3"></a>The main point of the amendment is to put right something unacceptable. If an asylum seeker does things properly and claims asylum at the point of entry or within three days--if the amendment holds, as I hope it will, in its passage through the other place--then the asylum seeker is entitled to various benefits, including homelessness accommodation. If the Home Office turns down the application, all the benefits stop unless and until the asylum seeker is successful in carrying out an appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para4"></a>I believe I have got it right as regards financial benefits. The Government have said that a successful asylum appeal to an adjudicator or an immigration appeal tribunal will result in the asylum seeker getting back the financial benefits that he lost during that period. But as regards homelessness accommodation, that clearly is not possible. Not many asylum seekers are eligible for homelessness accommodation because they are not in the priority categories. But, as the Minister confirmed, if an asylum seeker is entitled to homelessness accommodation, as soon as the local authority is aware that the Home Office has turned down the asylum application it will have to turn him out. It need only reconsider the claim as and when the asylum seeker wins the appeal. That period between being turned down by the Home Office and having an appeal resolved can be weeks, is likely to be months, and could be years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para5"></a>It is quite appalling that an individual who is deemed homeless and who, quite properly under the law, is put into homelessness accommodation by the local authority should then be made homeless from homelessness accommodation. That is absurd. I cannot believe that the Government could on a clear day, thinking about it, wish that to be the outcome. It is not comparable to loss of financial benefits. The Government are saying that that person and the family will be thrown out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para6"></a>If there are children, the local authority will continue to bear the responsibility. It then has to go through the complicated process of assessing the family under local authority provisions in order to see whether it can step in and help that particular family. The process is complicated and bureaucratic. It is bound to be expensive for a local authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para7"></a>It is curious, to say the least, that the Government are telling a local authority which has housed an asylum seeker that the day after an asylum claim is turned down it has to throw the individual out while assessing, under other provisions put forward by the Government, whether to do something for the family, or at least take the children into care. I suggest that the whole procedure is likely to cost a great deal of public money--probably more than any perceived saving. It is a clumsy attempt to try to be consistent as between the policy on financial benefits and that on homelessness accommodation. It surely cannot be humane or sensible. I repeat: it cannot make any sense to turn people out of homelessness accommodation and make them homeless in the process. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, this is an important amendment, even though it affects only a small group <P>


<a name="column_108"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of people. If the consequence of withdrawal of benefits is homelessness, that will be a very strong incentive to asylum appellants to abandon their appeal or to withdraw from it. If that happens, it will negate the whole appeal procedure which has been built up over a long period of years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-27_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I shall not repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said. He put the case extremely well. I shall merely refresh the point that benefit withdrawn after appeal can be backdated and repaid. You cannot repay a home after an appeal. That is a vital distinction and I am most grateful to the noble Lord for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para8"></a>I am sure the Minister will recall a speech made at Third Reading of the asylum Bill by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, in support of an amendment moved from these Benches by my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby. The noble and learned Lord argued that the right to appeal is a fundamental judicial matter and that, by completely removing all means of support during an appeal, the Government might be thought to be frustrating the right of appeal itself. If the Minister has read the Court of Appeal judgment he will understand the reasoning behind the noble and learned Lord's thinking. It is a powerful and compelling point. The Minister will, of course, need to remember that the point of the Court of Appeal judgment was that the denial of benefits threatens the very right to seek asylum itself. I know he does not agree with that, but the question is one to be determined by the courts and not by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para9"></a>The amendment which was carried in this House in relation to entry will be, I believe, sufficient to protect the Government against that charge. Were they to accept the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, they would be protected against the second plank of that charge. The Minister should remember that although Parliament can do whatever it likes, it is incumbent upon Parliament to do something before the courts can understand what it has done. If Parliament enacts a contradiction, the courts cannot be certain which part of it Parliament intends.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 45 would prevent an asylum seeker, who is pursuing an appeal under the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 from being prescribed as ineligible for assistance under Part VII of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para10"></a>The amendment goes to the heart of the steps the Government are taking to reduce the number of asylum seekers who come to this country and lodge appeals that have no real basis. I shall remind your Lordships of the figures. Only three out of 100 appeals are found to be genuine asylum seekers. The other 97 are not. Those are the figures on appeals. I have advised your noble Lords on other occasions of those figures, and I apologise for doing so again, but I think it is well worth keeping in front of us the fact that only 3 per cent. are successful on appeal. Therefore, a very large number of asylum seekers pursue an appeal once the Home Office has refused their initial claim, and they do not succeed. Of course, all the time social security benefits and <P>


<a name="column_109"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assistance are being given, and to date they were considered for help under the homelessness legislation while they pursued these asylum claims.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para11"></a>We have been over this ground on a fair number of occasions, and this House and the other place have decided on various parts of the Asylum and Immigration Bill, which will, in fact, enact what I have been advocating for some time, and the parties opposite, of course, have been disputing for some time. Genuine asylum seekers come to this country to escape persecution and not to obtain benefit. As I have said on a number of occasions, it is as much in the interests of those who are genuinely seeking asylum, as it is in the interests of our own taxpayers to reduce the number of economic migrants currently clogging up the asylum system.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para12"></a>The Government are taking action to remove entitlement to benefits and to assistance under the homelessness legislation from people who enter this country on the understanding that they will support and accommodate themselves, or indeed people who come here illegally, but who then change their minds and decide to claim asylum, and then have their claims for asylum turned down by the Home Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para13"></a>I pointed out last week that since the social security regulations were introduced earlier in the year removing benefit entitlement from these groups, the number of asylum applications in March, April and May has reduced; indeed the number reduced quite dramatically in May. Excluding these groups from entitlement to assistance under the homelessness legislation is a logical extension of that policy. Moreover, it would not be acceptable to place local housing authorities under the additional, onerous, burden of having to meet the full housing costs of applicants accommodated under the homelessness legislation, who were unable to claim housing benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-27_para14"></a>Amendment No. 45 would undermine our policies of removing the incentive for economic migrants to come to this country and pursue unfounded claims for asylum, and, more generally, of aligning the entitlement of persons from abroad to assistance under the homelessness legislation with entitlement to housing benefit.

<A NAME="60708-28_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, could the Minister tell the House how he knows the claims have been unfounded before they are heard?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, we have been over this a great many times. Out of every 100 claims decided by the Home Office only five are granted asylum. Out of every 100 claims going to appeal only three are granted asylum. Those are the 1995 figures. The 1994 figures are somewhat similar. The position is there; it is quite clear and quite obvious. That is the evidence. I do not think one requires any more evidence. The position is perfectly clear. As I said, Amendment No. 45 would undermine our policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para0"></a>Amendment No. 46 would remove the regulation-making power which allows the Secretary of State to prescribe that certain groups of persons from <P>


<a name="column_110"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abroad are not eligible for assistance. As I hope I made clear, the Government are clear that persons from abroad who do not have a valid claim to public assistance--and that includes assistance under the homelessness legislation--should not have access to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para1"></a>It is important, therefore, that there should be scope to prescribe those classes of person who are not eligible for assistance under Part VII. Our policy is that entitlement to homelessness assistance should align with entitlement to housing benefit. The groups of persons we intend to prescribe as not eligible under Part VII will be precisely those groups which are excluded from entitlement to housing benefit under social security regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para2"></a>Amendment No. 46, like Amendment No. 45, would undermine that policy, and I cannot recommend either of the amendments to the House.

<A NAME="60708-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, in his comments the Minister seemed to imply that, despite doing the right thing by applying at the port of entry, such people should still be deterred from seeking to come here. That has taken the argument several stages further than the Government's original proposition, which was to draw a distinction between those claiming asylum at the ports and those who failed to do so but claimed asylum when they had been in the country for some time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para3"></a>The Minister thought that such a distinction would help the Government to control things on their terms. We on these Benches were not happy about any of that, but for the moment I accept the Government's argument. We have now taken the matter a great deal further. The Minister is now using the same type of emotional reasoning--if one can talk about emotional reasoning--or argument against those asylum seekers who have done as the Government said: they have claimed asylum at the point of entry; they have done everything properly and have had homelessness accommodation, if they were in the priority category, as only a small proportion of them would be; they are then turned down by the Home Office, maybe nine months, a year or two years later; and they then appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para4"></a>If there is any virtue in having a system of appeals, it is to ensure that justice is done to asylum seekers. Yet the Minister says, "No, no--most people do not win their appeals and so forget about justice to those people". That is what the Minister said tonight. That is what he said in this House on 24th June during the Report stage of the Asylum and Immigration Bill. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Frankly, unless their case is extraordinarily strong, my advice would be that they should consider returning home".--(Official Report, 24/6/96; col. 715.) </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He made the point on a number of occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para5"></a>If there is a concept of justice, it is not one that can be modified by statistics. Justice is for every single individual. It is not good enough to say that 3 per cent. win their appeal. Those 3 per cent. surely have certain basic rights. The Minister says, "We will forget about those rights; 3 per cent. is not enough to bother about and they ought to go home". That is the nub of the <P>


<a name="column_111"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government's argument. Furthermore, in quoting the 5 per cent. who obtained asylum status and the 3 per cent. who won appeals, the Minster forgot about the others--the 20 per cent. or so who obtained exceptional leave to remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para6"></a>But my key point is that if there is an appeal system, it ought not to be undermined by coercing people to leave the country and possibly face danger if they have to return to where they suffered persecution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para7"></a>Finally, the Government conceded that, where there are cash benefits which are lost to asylum seekers during the period between being turned down by the Home Office and winning an appeal, those who win appeals will obtain financial recompense. Not a word has been said about recompense to people who have lost their homelessness accommodation. I should have thought that justice and equity demand that the Government do something for those people who have lost out even more badly, because in the end they will end up on the streets, compared with those people--and it is bad enough--who have lost their financial benefits. So the Government even within their own policies are inconsistent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para8"></a>I do not know whether the Minister wants to comment further. Regrettably, we are now at Report stage. But I think the Government are wrong. They are behaving badly. They have not made their case. The right of appeal is a right of appeal for every single individual. The Government are seeking to undermine that right for individuals who may well have to face danger in the country from which they have fled. I think it is shameful. I think it is shabby. In the absence of any further comment from the Minister, I very reluctantly beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 50, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 51 to 53. Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 are simply drafting amendments which clarify the provisions in subsection (1) of Clause 175. They do not alter the substance of the clause and, with your Lordships' agreement, I do not intend to dwell on them further.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para15"></a>Beyond subsection (1), the provisions in Clause 175, as drafted, largely re-state existing provisions in the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, which provide a statutory framework for the Home Office to advise local housing authorities about the status of homeless applicants who are asylum seekers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para16"></a>Under the present homelessness legislation, authorities need to know whether an applicant is an asylum seeker, as that will affect whether a duty is owed and, if so, the extent of the duty. Broadly speaking, no duty is owed to asylum seekers who have accommodation--however temporary it is--which is available to them. Where they do not have accommodation available to them and they meet the normal statutory homeless criteria--that is, they are unintentionally homeless and in priority need--the duty owed is to secure temporary accommodation pending resolution of their asylum claim.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para17"></a>Under the present legislation, authorities need to know when the status of asylum seekers whom they are accommodating changes: if their asylum claim fails they are no longer entitled to homelessness assistance. That will remain broadly the same, but Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 update the provisions in the Bill to reflect the revised information needs of housing authorities in the light of the new position on asylum seekers' entitlement to benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para18"></a>Authorities will continue to need to know whether an applicant is an asylum seeker but, additionally, they will need to know the circumstances which will determine whether the applicant is eligible for assistance under Part VII--such as whether he claimed asylum on arrival. The new clause after Clause 175, which would be inserted by Amendment No. 53, will provide for that. Amendment No. 52 paves the way by deleting the associated provisions in Clause 175 which would no longer be required. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, again this is an amendment which we have not had time to examine in the detail in which we would have wished. However, I wish to make some comments, particularly on Amendment No. 53. I appreciate that in some respects the point of Amendment No. 53 is not totally different from the equivalent clause as already stated on the face of the Bill. Nevertheless, I should like to ask the Minister a number of questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para19"></a>First, I should like some assurance that information that goes from a local authority to the Secretary of State will not be passed on to the Home Office. I say that because it is accepted practice in this country--sometimes breached--that when government seek information for one purpose, they will not use that information for other purposes. It would be a matter of assurance to individuals if that information were not <P>


<a name="column_113"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>directly passed to the Home Office. There may be arguments to the contrary, but there is a point at issue there and there may be some anxieties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para20"></a>Perhaps I may continue with my questions. Secondly, have the Government assessed how much work this will involve for the Home Office, the Secretary of State for the Environment and for local authorities? There is a danger that all of them will be put to a great deal of work and effort. I wonder what the implications are in that connection. Thirdly, what happens if a local authority actually passes a name to the Secretary of State for the Environment and nothing is known of that individual by the Home Office or by the Secretary of State? I find this matter quite complicated. There may well be people who the local authority suspects are asylum seekers, but it has no way of determining that and so the local authority will pass names to the Secretary of State and he will then have to make a decision. As regards my first question as to whether information will be passed to the Home Office, I suspect that the answer is that information will be passed because only that department can give the answer. I can see a rather difficult, circular argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para21"></a>Fourthly, what happens if nothing is known of the individual? There will be difficulties. The local authority may consider the case of a black person who is thought to be an asylum seeker, even though that person was born in this country and has lived with his family here for more than one generation. There may be the difficulty that an attempt is made to investigate the individual, who is British in every possible sense, having been born here, and who does not come under these provisions. That means there is the danger that there will be discrimination by local authorities who will not want to get involved in all the complexities of the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-28_para22"></a>Those are four questions, and I have a fifth, which applies to these amendments as it did to the others, but the Minister did not answer it. What recompense is to be given to an asylum seeker who is thrown out of homelessness accommodation for the reasons discussed in the previous short debate? What recompense is to be given if and when that asylum seeker is given refugee status or exceptional leave to remain as the result of an appeal? Surely some recompense is there by right. Will the Government make some available?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has picked up the clause and the amendments wrongly because the Secretary of State involved is the Home Secretary. The Secretary of State for the Environment does not come into this issue at all. The information seems to be going in the opposite way because the new clause in Amendment No. 53 states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall, at the request of a local housing authority provide the authority with such information as they may require". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
So the information is going the other way, from the Home Office to the local authority, after information has been requested on the person before it.
<P>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para0"></a>I have already mentioned on a number of occasions the code of guidance and the information that already exists for local authorities when they ask people for their details. The local authority has to ask everyone particular questions when they present themselves under the homelessness legislation. It has to be established whether they are homeless, where they have been living, how many children there are and what is the position. All these questions have to be answered. I believe that the local authorities, as I have said before, have plenty of experience to be able to decide when they may have to ask a question about immigration status. That is perfectly clear. I imagine that many people will just say, "Yes, I am an asylum seeker and I claimed at the port of entry". It will then be fairly easy for the local authority to check that information. If the applicant is not telling the truth to the local authority then the Home Office will be unable to confirm that the person is an asylum seeker who claimed asylum at the port of entry. Therefore, I do not believe there is a great problem there. These procedures have to take place already in certain cases under the 1993 Act. I do not believe that there will be any great difficulty about the information which will pass largely from the Home Office to the local authority regarding the individual under consideration. Of course, nothing may be known about a person.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para1"></a>As I have said, the code of guidance on the screening procedure applies to absolutely everyone. We shall discuss the code with the Commission for Racial Equality, as we did with the last code. To be honest, there is no evidence that the current procedures are not working well. I believe that that answers the points raised about the code of guidance and the information passed to the Home Office, which will largely be sufficient information to allow the Home Office to identify a person and to check whether he is who he says he is.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para2"></a>On the question about workload, the arrangements provided in the new clause, which is Amendment No. 53, are broadly the same as the present arrangements which are provided under the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993. Therefore, I do not believe that there will be any great increase in the workload.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para3"></a>The noble Lord also asked about recompense. As he knows, if somebody appeals against an asylum decision and wins that appeal, I announced a fortnight ago today--we introduced legislation last Monday to give effect to this--that that person's benefits will be backdated. On the point about recompense in relation to the homelessness legislation, that does not involve money one way or the other so there will be no recompense for that aspect. However, if somebody who has been helped by a charity wins his appeal--I have explained that only three in 100 do so--his benefit will be backdated and he will be able to pay back some of the money that he has received from the charity or whoever has helped him.

<A NAME = "60708-29_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment stands in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham. It seeks to add another category of people who have a priority need for accommodation to those listed in Clause 177(1). In this case we seek to specify that young people leaving care have a priority need.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para16"></a>This amendment is not dissimilar to one moved in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. His amendment went to the issue of suitability. Section 24 of the Children Act 1989, to which I referred, places a duty on a local authority which has been looking after a child to advise, assist and befriend the child with a view to promoting his welfare once he ceases to be looked after by a local authority. It is a limited duty. A person qualifying for advice and assistance means a person within the area of the authority under 21 and one who, after reaching the age of 16, was looked after by the local authority, accommodated by and on behalf of a voluntary organisation, accommodated in a registered children's home, by a health authority, an LEA, a residential care home or privately fostered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para17"></a>Most young people leave home in their early 20s. The average age for people leaving home among the general population is, I understand, 22. People leave with the support of their family, no doubt taking their washing back at weekends--we have all either done that or had it done to us--and find their feet over a period. Approximately 8,000 young people leave care before their 18th birthday. For them it is a much sharper, more sudden and clearer demarcation. Some continue to receive support from a statutory or voluntary agency to find suitable accommodation. Many will set about the task of finding a home on their own, with little or no support or chance of returning to their family. The lack of family cuts them off not only from minor things like taking the washing home, but help with rent deposits and even help with finding a place to live. Young people leaving care are, I believe, particularly vulnerable to homelessness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para18"></a>At present some local authorities carry out assessments on homeless young people and may provide them with accommodation if they consider them to be vulnerable; but only just over half the local authorities regard homeless 16 and 17 year-old care leavers as vulnerable in every case. The amendment is intended to ensure that the vulnerability of young people is recognised on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-29_para19"></a>At the last stage on 25th June, the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, said (at col. 875 of Hansard) that he regarded the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, as unnecessary. He talked of the obligations of a housing authority, but the <P>


<a name="column_117"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>housing authority only has a duty to comply with a request from social services in this context if that does not conflict with its other duties. So if the housing authority's other duties do not include preference for care leavers then these young people will be in no better a position than anyone else. On a more practical level, people working as housing officers are rather more versed in housing law than in social services law. So I think it would be better to have an explicit duty on the face of the Bill. I do not believe that it is unnecessary; nor indeed do I believe it is a duplication. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I should have liked to support this amendment when it was previously moved by my noble friend Lord Northbourne. I think it is a fact that provision for young people leaving care varies enormously across the country. Some excellent work has been done on it by such voluntary bodies as the Coram Foundation and various children's societies. Nevertheless a considerable number of young people do leave care without assistance from anybody. They are particularly vulnerable, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has pointed out and, in my view, they are extremely likely to drift into crime, to be drawn into crime or to find themselves before the courts for one reason or another. The amendment highlights a very sensitive situation. It is a valuable proposal that should be accepted by the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-30_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, it is right that the noble Baroness should draw attention to the situation of children because they are very important. However, I am bound to tell her that I do not believe that the amendment is needed. The first reason is that children leaving care may well be determined by the local authority as vulnerable within the categories specified in subsection (1) of Clause 177 and will therefore be in priority need for accommodation. The department's homelessness code of guidance for local authorities picks up the point. It states that some groups of young people will be less able to fend for themselves than others and gives those leaving local authority care as a specific example of how the provision should be applied.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para0"></a>The second reason is that the Children Act itself makes provision to ensure that support will continue for young people leaving care. Apart from defining who such people are, Section 24 also requires social services authorities to advise, assist and befriend young people when they leave their care. Further, a social services authority, under Section 27 of that Act may call on the assistance of a housing authority in discharging its duty to that young person. If such a request is made the housing authority is under a duty to comply with it. There are already two statutory safety nets for children leaving care--the vulnerable category in Clause 177 of the Bill and the provisions <P>


<a name="column_118"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Children Act 1989. I suggest that there is no need to identify them specifically on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that the provision in Clause 177 is as obvious as the Minister suggested. He refers to the vulnerable category in Clause 177(1)(c):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person who is vulnerable as a result of old age, mental illness or handicap or physical disability or other special reason". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
There follows a provision which allows the Secretary of State to specify further descriptions. The Minister referred to the homelessness code of guidance. That is a code, not a statutory provision. He also referred to the section of the Children Act which requires the local authority to advise, assist and befriend. That is not a requirement to provide accommodation. I would have wished to see the direct obligation on the face of the Bill. I anticipated that the Minister would tell me that the housing authority had a duty but I am advised that the duty is to be observed if it does not conflict with other duties. For that reason, I am concerned that if the other duties do not include preference for care leavers this group of young people will not be covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para1"></a>I am not sure that we will get any further tonight. I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. There appears to be a difference of interpretation between myself and the Government. Perhaps I should look at the matter again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-30_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may assist the noble Baroness. Clause 177(1)(c) refers to
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person who is vulnerable as a result of old age, mental illness or handicap or physical disability or other special reason". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The courts have held that those other special reasons can also include young vulnerable people. So I think she will find, as far as concerns the results which have appeared in the court, that young people fall in the category to be found in Clause 177(1)(c).

As your Lordships will see, Amendments Nos. 56 and 68 are similar. They are designed to ensure that Clauses 178 and 183 give proper consideration to fair treatment for people who are specifically mentally ill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para5"></a>Your Lordships may wonder why I picked out these particular people. As I see it, the reason for their inclusion on the face of the Bill, in addition to the point <P>


<a name="column_119"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that my noble friend Lord Ferrers has just drawn to our attention in Clause 177, is that from time to time, unlike other disabled people who are not mentally ill, as well as other homeless people, people who are severely mentally ill are sometimes not responsible for what they do. I made this point to your Lordships in Committee at col. 851 on 25th June so I shall not press that point any further at this stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para6"></a>Amendment No. 69 makes a similar point--but from a slightly different point of view because of the text of the clause--in relation to Clause 184. I suggest to the Government that in the case of Amendment No. 72, which seeks to amend Amendment No. 71, the local authority should take into consideration an applicant's health including, but not by any means exclusively, mental illness. That is important for all people who are affected by Clause 185, as are characteristics and personal circumstances. It seems to me that that would be a very important further aspect which Clause 185 needs to cover.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para7"></a>I truly believe that these particular points need to be included in the Bill. They are very small points and I hope that my noble friend will feel that he can accept them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-30_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, when we discussed this in Committee one of the distinctions drawn by noble Lords on these Benches was that we believed, and pressed the Minister, that somebody who suffered from mental illness or a severe learning difficulty whose actions gave rise to some concern about anti-social behaviour, may very well need to be rehoused because their behaviour may be intolerable to other tenants who may themselves be frail and elderly and have a need for quiet enjoyment. But though they may need to be rehoused in a different form of accommodation they should not be regarded as making themselves intentionally homeless, which is what these amendments address.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para8"></a>At the time, when we pressed the Minister on this with the help of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, he said he believed that such people would have made themselves intentionally homeless. But I believe that the Government may now be able to widen that point--I try to put it diplomatically--to suggest that there may be other considerations and it may not be the case that such people have made themselves deliberately homeless if they were not aware of the consequences, or could not appreciate the consequences, of their activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para9"></a>I repeat, that does not remove the need--not invariably but very probably--to rehouse such a person if their behaviour is intolerable to others who may be equally frail. But at least it would ensure, if that is the case, an ongoing duty of responsibility to the local authority, which is clearly appropriate in these cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Mottistone. A number of people will be in that position because of the closure of mental hospitals and because they are no longer able to have a bed there as a result of the Government's care <P>


<a name="column_120"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in the community policy. I feel that this is part of care in the community and will assist in their care. Therefore, I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-30_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, this is a rather difficult area of life with which we must deal. Again, I believe that my noble friend and other noble Lords are quite right to draw attention to it because those who are mentally ill have a way of behaving which makes it difficult sometimes to assess whether their behaviour is due to their illness and they do not know what they are doing or whether they know perfectly well what they are doing and, therefore, their behaviour cannot necessarily be ascribed to their illness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para10"></a>All these amendments seek to ensure that the local housing authority shall have regard to the physical or mental health of the applicant when it fulfils certain of its duties under the provisions of Part VII. In particular, the amendments would require authorities to have regard to that when considering the vexed issue of what is rather indelicately called "intentionality".
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para11"></a>I believe that these amendments are not necessary. Your Lordships will recall that this matter was discussed in some detail in Committee when the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, asked whether someone suffering from mental or physical ill health would be regarded as intentionally homeless if his behaviour was such as to cause the local authority to evict him. My noble friend Lord Lucas wrote to the noble Baroness on 3rd July about this matter and he copied his letter to all who spoke in the debate on Parts V and VII of the Bill. He arranged that a copy should be placed in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para12"></a>My noble friend made it clear that under Clause 179 a person becomes homeless intentionally if he deliberately does or fails to do anything in consequence of which he ceases to occupy accommodation. The same consideration applies to becoming threatened with homelessness. The action or inaction must be deliberate and, clearly, it would be for the local housing authority to determine in each case whether a person's actions or inactions were deliberate and therefore whether the extent of the authority's duty towards the person under the homelessness legislation continued.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para13"></a>The homelessness code of guidance will be revised. The existing code advises that an authority should not, as a general rule, consider certain situations to be deliberate. One of those is that the authority had reason to believe that the applicant is incapable of managing his affairs--for example, as a result of old age, mental illness or handicap. The revised guidance will reiterate that point, but the assessment of whether actions or inactions are deliberate must rest with the authority and must be determined in each separate case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-30_para14"></a>The issue of vulnerability, in whatever form it comes, is, in the long term, bound to be one for the authority to determine. It would be wrong to tie down the authorities in their consideration of individual cases in the way in which my noble friend's amendments propose. Therefore, I understand my noble friend's concerns and I think that he is quite right to raise them. But in the <P>


<a name="column_121"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>end, the vulnerability must be a matter for the authority to determine. Therefore, the Bill as it stands covers the matters about which my noble friend is anxious.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mottistone: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate what the Minister said and that he understands why I have tabled these amendments. I thank also my noble friend Lord Lucas for sending me a copy of his letter to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, which took us a little further in that direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para0"></a>However, the Minister said that he thinks it is unnecessary to include this provision in the Bill. My reason for believing that it is necessary is borne out by what he went on to say, namely, that the guidance will be re-written. One always knows that guidance that is being re-written is something over which Parliament has little control. At present the guidance refers to a housing authority having reason to believe a particular circumstance is occurring. That is how I understand the matter. However, since housing authorities were set up, we have had care in the community. The noble Earl and his department have perhaps been thinking about housing and that side of local government. However, that is quite different from social services which work now with health authorities to provide assessments of people who are severely mentally ill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para1"></a>My amendments, Amendments Nos. 56 and 68 state,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"after a medical examination and report". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I rather think that that was what my noble friend considered unnecessary, because a housing authority would make its own decision. We now have a system--which is written into the law--of having assessments made of people who are mentally ill, or who are suspected of being mentally ill. Therefore, there is a source of information which can be referred to over and above an opinion which a housing authority may have. It would seem to me there is a worthwhile opportunity for my noble friend to consider returning with an amendment of his own at Third Reading to seek to take advantage of the care in the community facilities relating to the mentally ill. Those facilities would be worth referring to rather than depending rather vaguely on amendments to the guidance. I hope the House will allow my noble friend to tell me whether he would consider doing that between now and the next stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-31_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, of course I shall consider what noble Lords and my noble friend have said. The important point to remember in all this is that one can, if one is not careful, cut up the legislation--if I may use that phrase without being too vulgar--with all sorts of provisions which may in the long term be undesirable. That is why one has codes of guidance. They fill in what one might describe as the loose spots. The legislation ought to give the whole picture as a generality. The code of guidance then explains how the provision should be carried out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para2"></a>In the case we are discussing the code of guidance pre-dates care in the community and requires updating in the light of experience. We intend to do that by consulting the Department of Health. Therefore I believe the code of guidance constitutes the best way of <P>


<a name="column_122"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>approaching the matter. Of course I shall take into account what my noble friend and others said. If there is any way I think the provision ought to be altered before the next stage, I shall let my noble friend know. However, I do not wish to raise his hopes too high. I believe the provision is best kept as it is, and that the matter is addressed by the code of guidance. However, I shall certainly consider what my noble friend said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mottistone: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend the Minister for undertaking to consider the matter further. I wish to leave him with one point which I tried to make earlier; namely, there is a difference between people who are mentally ill, and other patients, in that unlike other people the supposition is not that they might be pulling a fast one under circumstances in which their mental illness is taking effect. Often when their mental illness is taking effect they can fool people into thinking that it is not; and then people get killed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para3"></a>Having heard that, and hoping that my noble friend will budge a little before the next stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall be brief. The amendment provides a way of allowing the Government to expedite what we all wish to see.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para11"></a>The Government expect local authorities to house the great majority of homeless families within two years. For those years local authorities have a responsibility, a duty, to ensure that there is temporary housing while those families wait. Thereafter, the local authority must review the circumstances and may extend their responsibility beyond the two years. As we rehearsed earlier today, in many parts of the country--London, the South and rural areas--homeless families will have to <P>


<a name="column_123"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wait longer than two years before their time comes through. Equally, if they have special needs, and are hard to house--those who are disabled, those who require a larger property--they are also likely to have to wait for two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para12"></a>Given by definition that homeless families are entering a common waiting list--people other than homeless families will now have additional preference--it means that homeless families will be waiting longer, and are less likely to be housed within the two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para13"></a>The amendment allows the Secretary of State to review the situation: whether the majority of applicants in a local authority are housed within two years; whether there has been a build up of households in temporary accommodation; and whether this leads to unjust and unacceptable treatment of homeless people. If so, the Secretary of State can extend the minimum duty beyond the two years. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-31_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, one of the central aims of our reform of the homelessness legislation is to ensure that local housing authorities are the last resort--not the first resort--for people who find themselves in a housing crisis. It is vitally important that there should be a safety net to help people who find themselves in difficulties through no fault of their own, and who are unable to resolve those difficulties without help.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para14"></a>The present homelessness legislation was intended to provide that. But, increasingly, it has become clear that the present statutory framework provides an incentive to some people simply to turn to their local housing authority for help without first making any effort themselves. I do not think that that is right, and I doubt whether any of your Lordships think it right either. Everybody must be expected to take some responsibility for meeting their own needs within the limits of their own capabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para15"></a>The provisions in Part VII will ensure that local authorities must continue to provide a safety net for families and vulnerable people who have become homeless through no fault of their own. Where the authority is not satisfied that there is suitable other accommodation available, it will have a duty to secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para16"></a>When these provisions were first introduced in another place, it was proposed that this duty should last for a minimum of 12 months. But in response to representations made at that time, the minimum period was extended to two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para17"></a>In most areas I believe that that should be sufficient time for the household to be allocated a social tenancy through the housing register, if that is what they require. Let us remember that at least three-quarters of all people allocated council housing get it within that period. If not, the authority has a discretionary power in Clause 182 to continue to secure accommodation for up to a further two years, and possibly beyond if necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para18"></a>An authority can continue to secure accommodation for a household for as long as it wishes. That is a generous provision. Two years is far longer than most <P>


<a name="column_124"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people in most circumstances will need to find longer-term accommodation. There is a provision for continuing assistance, but it must be subject to periodic review. I do not see that there is justification for adding legislation to the Bill which will alter the provision. Nor do I see why it should be subjected to prescription by the Secretary of State. I hope that the noble Baroness will be content with that position which is a great improvement on what it was in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-31_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, occasionally one sees the size of the gulf between us. The Minister's reply was to make comments such as: "People should not get council housing if they have not taken responsibility for themselves". It is as though getting a council house is an act of dependency. Like other people in your Lordships' House, I have been involved in the provision of council housing for a quarter of a century. I find that attitude unfortunate and wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para19"></a>Council housing is provided by citizens of a local authority for each other. The assumption seems to be that you help yourself if you go into the private rented sector and pay more for less, but that you are being dependent if you go into a council house provided by yourself, as a citizen and local taxpayer, and you are being less than upstanding and independent. I find that a serious misreading of what council housing has been about since it was first instigated under the Addison Rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para20"></a>I wish that the Government would understand what council housing has done over the generations. I will tell the Minister what it has done. It has broken the link between poverty and lousy housing for generations of people in this country. Nor has it come by courtesy of a subsidy from the taxpayer. That is another myth regularly propagated by the Government. Over the past decade, little new capital money has come into council housing, the subsidy comes not from central government to council tenants, it comes as a result of rent pooling and therefore a mutual subsidy from one tenant to another. The notion that such tenants are getting a freebie from the taxpayer is wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para21"></a>The third point I wish to tackle in the Minister's reply is that he continually said that council housing is such a scarce resource that we must not allow permanent housing to go to the undeserving. If it is such a valuable resource, why have the Government refused to allow local authorities to add to it by allowing them to recycle their capital assets? If it is such a valuable resource, why may not local authorities multiply it and meet housing need in the way they should? If that were to happen we would not have some of the problems that we face with the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-31_para22"></a>If the Government Benches refer to council housing, I hope they will recognise it for what it is: a community asset provided by the local community for its citizens through the mutual pooling of rents. That is how it is formed and run. The notion that somehow you are being a less than upstanding citizen if you seek a council house and that therefore the Government must narrow the entry to it because local authorities cannot be trusted <P>


<a name="column_125"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to do so is an unfortunate and undesirable response. There is no meeting of minds on this. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: After that diatribe from the noble Baroness, perhaps we may turn to Amendment No. 62. It relates to concerns which were expressed during Committee by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that under the clause an authority may be able to discharge its duty prior to the end of the two-year period required by subsection (3) with an offer, through the housing register, of unsuitable accommodation. The noble Earl said that it had been the practice of some authorities to offer unsuitable accommodation to people whom they did not want to house; the duty would end if an applicant refused the offer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para1"></a>It has always been our intention to ensure that the duty may only be discharged if the accommodation offered is suitable. We have had the opportunity to consider the implications of subsection (3) further. Although it is my view that the provisions in the subsection would provide the protection which the noble Earl seeks, it is important to put the matter beyond doubt. Amendment No. 62 does so; an authority must satisfy itself that accommodation offered through the housing register is suitable before it discharges its duty. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60708-32_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl very warmly for this provision. I agree with him: I believe it does put the matter beyond doubt. I hope it will make things work a good deal better in practice, and I thank him for that.

<A NAME = "60708-32_para5"></a>In a rather throw-away line in responding to Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 the Minister seemed to dispose of these amendments by saying that he saw no need to dispense with the review. Nevertheless, I introduce them in order to obtain a slightly longer response.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para6"></a>Clause 182 allows a local housing authority to continue to provide accommodation after the minimum period but only when it has carried out a review of the matters set out in Clause 182(2). This small set of amendments seeks to give the Secretary of State the power to set aside the requirement for a review.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para7"></a>We have heard on a number of occasions of the quite possible but almost absurd position that an authority may have to turf a family out of temporary accommodation <P>


<a name="column_126"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>after two years if in its view at the end of the period no other suitable accommodation is available in the district, even if the family is "nearly there" and could expect an offer of permanent accommodation quite quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para8"></a>This amendment would allow the Secretary of State to give a local housing authority a discretion as to whether or not to secure accommodation depending on the circumstances of the individual case. I cannot see that this would lead to any danger that authorities would leave families in temporary accommodation needlessly, since such accommodation is likely to be more expensive than permanent accommodation. It would be quite irrational for an authority not to re-house a family as it reaches the head of the queue for permanent housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para9"></a>The Bill allows the Secretary of State to do a very great deal by regulation. This amendment would leave Clause 182(1) intact and gives him the possibility of allowing something not to be done, but to pass the discretion to the local housing authority. I beg to move.

I move with hesitation lest I stimulate the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, into a twizzle again and she lacerates me on my understanding--or misunderstanding in her view--of the object of council houses. I will ask her to be quiescent over that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para10"></a>We have already discussed, in dealing with Amendments Nos. 60 and 61, the extension of the minimum period to accommodate to two years. The authority also has a discretionary power in Clause 182 to continue to secure accommodation for up to a further two years and possibly beyond if necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para11"></a>If the authority declines to exercise that power and if the household believes that it is still entitled to assistance, then it can make a further application. Authorities will recognise that it is not in their interests to provoke further justifiable applications in this way and will wish to think carefully about whether to continue providing accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para12"></a>When the authority decides to exercise its power to provide accommodation beyond the initial two-year period it must check that the household is still eligible for assistance. For example, it would have to check whether the children, who might have formed the basis of the priority need in the first place, are still part of the household. It must also satisfy itself whether other suitable accommodation is now available in the area. Those are the criteria which determine whether a household is eligible for the two year homeless duty. It is perfectly reasonable and logical that they should be the same criteria which must be satisfied before an authority can exercise its power to continue to secure accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para13"></a>Clause 182 allows an authority to continue to secure accommodation for a household for as long as it wishes. That is a generous provision, but it is inherent in the policy that such assistance should only be available to people who need it, and there must be reasonable periodic checks <P>


<a name="column_127"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to ensure that people retain the basic entitlement to it. The review requirement in Clause 182 achieves that. I do not see any reason, or indeed any justification, for adding provisions to the Bill which would allow those fundamental provisions to be suspended.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para14"></a>The noble Baroness was concerned that the local authority may have to turn a family out after two years. Theoretically it could do so, but, of course, there is no point in doing so. If the household is still in priority need and there is no alternative accommodation, then there will have to be a new duty for two years if the household re-applies. Therefore, I think that is a situation which is unlikely to materialise in fact, even though in theory it might be possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-32_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, might I say that only the rules of order have hitherto restrained me from saying that the noble Baroness did not speak only for herself.

I do not think that he was restrained by any rules of order from saying so, in the same way as I do not think I was restrained by any rules from saying that I thought the noble Baroness had gone a bit far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-32_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   No, my Lords, the noble Baroness did not speak only for herself. It is with a little difficulty that I am not starting on my own diatribe. I think one could add, for instance, the use of housing revenue accounts by some authorities over the years, to give but one example.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-32_para15"></a>The Minister says that the local housing authority must check certain things. This is circular. It "must check" only if the Bill requires that it shall check. The Minister says that this is a generous provision, as if somehow the provision of housing is a gift. He goes on to say that as a matter of fact a local housing authority probably would not find itself in the position that I have posed. The Secretary of State has so many powers to make prescription and to make regulations that I am rather sorry that the Minister is not accepting the offer of another one, simply to help matters along. However, I can see that he is not going to accept this gift from me. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para14"></a>The House will be aware that there was considerable discussion at Committee stage of the period in which an applicant could request a review of a decision on his homelessness application. We were treated to some eloquent expositions by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and other noble Lords on the circumstances in which applicants might be unable to lodge a request within 14 days.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para15"></a>Amendment No. 79 would extend the time in which an applicant may request a review to 21 days. I believe that this will provide ample time for people in the circumstances envisaged by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and by other noble Lords, to request a review. As my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish said during Committee, it is in the interests both of applicants and local authorities to ensure a swift resolution of a homelessness application. It is in no one's interest to encourage applicants to delay putting in their appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para16"></a>Amendment No. 80 will allow an authority, should it choose to do so, to extend the period by informing the applicant in writing. That will enable authorities to make exception in any case where they consider that an applicant may have difficulty in meeting the deadline.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 81, 82 and 83 address concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, during Committee stage. They create an avenue of appeal to the county court for applicants who are dissatisfied with the results of an authority's own review.
<P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para18"></a>These amendments build on provisions already contained in the Bill to safeguard applicants' rights to a fair hearing. Clause 190 contains a new requirement for local authorities to establish a procedure for reviewing decisions that they have made as to the discharge of their duties. The review procedure in Clause 190 covers all the main areas in which the applicant has a substantive right.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para19"></a>Amendment No. 82 deals with the review procedure itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para20"></a>I am happy to go into the details of the other amendments. They mostly answer points raised by noble Lords opposite. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said in a moment of despair a short while ago that she was not going to get anything out of the Government, I hope that she realises that she has actually got something; and quite a bit. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I have a brief query. The amendment is welcome. It confines itself to 21 days. I wonder whether we could persuade the Government to come back with an amendment including the words "or with good cause" either at Third Reading or at some later date. That would cover the cases where somebody with a physical illness or disability who may be in hospital, or somebody with a mental illness or learning difficulty who may have a problem meeting the 21-day deadline, may not fully understand the import.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para21"></a>The situation must be carefully watched so as to ensure that it is not a source of abuse. But perhaps the Minister will accept that in a few cases there may be good reason for not meeting the 21-day deadline. Under those circumstances the local authority should be required to receive appeals beyond the 21 days. I would have no objection to it being done through the code of guidance. Perhaps the Minister can help us on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-33_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I recognise something that is even more than crumbs of comfort: a genuine movement on the part of the Government. The noble Baroness is quite right. Mixing my metaphors, it would be a shame to spoil the crumb for a ha'p'orth of tar.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para22"></a>I tabled a manuscript amendment and perhaps I can explain it at this stage as it is an amendment to the Government's Amendment No. 83. Amendment No. 83A seeks to omit the word "may" and insert "shall"; in other words, to provide that the authority shall continue to secure accommodation during the period for an appeal if and until an appeal is brought. It is a simple but important point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para23"></a>In tabling the amendment I suggest that the interim duty should continue until final determination of the matter. After all, it is the point of the right of appeal. It should not be argued--anticipating what the Government may say--that somebody may use the right of appeal to stay in accommodation. The matter is not at an end until the appeal procedure has been exhausted or the right to appeal has not been used. Perhaps the Minister can comment on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-33_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, in joining in the thanks, I should like to join with what the noble Baroness, <P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lady Hollis, said in regard to "good cause". On the CSA in 1991 I tabled an amendment almost equivalent to that suggested by the noble Baroness. It came up well past one in the morning and I did not move it. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack incorporated it in the Bill at the next stage as a government amendment. I have had many notable courtesies from the Government, but that one takes some beating.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-33_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am more than flattered that so many noble Lords should be grateful to me--they are right to be grateful because I have gone a long way to try to help them. But there may be a moral in what the noble Earl says; that is, if he does not move some of his amendments we may accept them without his argument; if he argues them they may become less attractive. However, I am grateful to the noble Earl for that kindness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para24"></a>When the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, rose to speak and asked if we could extend the time a little longer, I wondered whether she had ever sold a horse--she would do jolly well at it. First, we put in 14 days and the noble Baroness, at Committee stage, wanted 28 days. We then thought again about it and decided that 21 days would be a good compromise, but the noble Baroness comes back with, "What about a little bit more?".
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para25"></a>We believe 21 days is actually right, but the noble Baroness should not get too excited. If the noble Baroness would like to address her mind to Amendment No. 80, she will see that it says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or such longer period as the authority may in writing allow". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That covers her point, which is that it should be 21 days or longer, under those circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-33_para26"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, mentioned her Amendment No. 83A. That seeks to change the power to provide accommodation into a duty. That would place a more onerous requirement on an authority than exists under the present legislation or than is provided for in Clause 176 when the authority carries out a review of its own. I do not believe that we want that. I hope that the noble Baroness will agree that that might be going, to use a colloquialism, over the top. I am grateful to her for putting down that amendment and for making us look at the matter again, but the Bill is better without the amendment.

<BR>
section (Discharge of functions: arrangements with registered social landlord) (arrangements with registered social landlord).
<BR>
(2) In those sections those functions are referred to as the authority's "housing functions under this Part".").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak at the same time to Amendments Nos. 85 to 87. Amendments Nos. 87A, 88 and 88A will also come within its purview, as will Amendments Nos. 89, 90, 100 and 252. All these amendments relate to the discharge of functions by local housing authorities under Part VII.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para5"></a>Clause 191 contains a number of important provisions which govern the way in which authorities may carry out their duties. They make clear, for example, that an authority may provide accommodation itself or it may secure accommodation from somebody else. It also provides that if an authority uses its own stock to rehouse somebody, then it may only do so for two years in every three. The exception is where the accommodation is a hostel or is leased. The clause also allows an authority to make a reasonable charge for the accommodation which it provides. In many cases that will be met in part or in full by housing benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para6"></a>A number of noble Lords voiced their concern during Committee stage that the provisions in Clause 191 did not give local authorities sufficient flexibility to discharge their duties. In particular, concern was expressed about the two years in three years provision. Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 are paving amendments. They broaden the scope of the supplementary provisions in Part VII by giving effect to the new clauses inserted by Amendments Nos. 87, 89 and 90.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para7"></a>Before I turn to Amendments Nos. 86 and 87, perhaps I may remind your Lordships of the purpose of the two years in three years provision in Clause 191. They enable an authority to use its own long-term stock for providing accommodation for no more than two years. Thereafter it may not accommodate the same household in such stock until the elapse of a further year. The aim of the two years in three years provision is to preserve the principle of a single route into long-term social housing. Some authorities may want to set aside part of their housing stock for short-term use in the discharge of their homelessness duties. That is entirely reasonable. But it would not be reasonable for an authority to accommodate someone indefinitely in its own stock on this basis. It would create a back-door route into long-term social housing, which would be grossly unfair on people on the housing register.
<P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para8"></a>Some noble Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, expressed concern in Committee that the provision may cause hardship in some cases. We have listened sympathetically to the arguments put to us by the noble Baroness and others. We have made clear our willingness to consider alternative propositions, provided these met our objective of ensuring a single route into social housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 86 and 87 address the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness and other noble Lords. They replace the provisions in Clause 191 with a new set of provisions. The new provisions contain a direction-making power to enable the Secretary of State to waive the provisions where an authority would otherwise be unable reasonably to discharge its duties under this part. The waiver would apply to specified types of applicant--for example, large families or people requiring specially adapted housing--and may last for up to a year. This would have the effect of extending the two years in three provision to a three years in four provision. If an authority wishes to extend the period further, it must apply for a new direction, and demonstrate that it still needs the flexibility that a direction would allow.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para10"></a>The waiver may be subject to a number of conditions. These may require the authority to review its priorities or its allocation scheme to ensure that the problem did not recur. It is our belief that, wherever possible, authorities should address long-term needs through the housing register.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 87, 87A, 88 and 88A seek to remove limitations set on the use of the direction-making power. Amendment No. 87A, which stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would allow the power to be used even where an authority could otherwise be able reasonably to discharge its housing functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para12"></a>Amendment No. 88, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, seeks to extend the period during which a direction may apply and to remove the Secretary of State's powers to impose conditions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para13"></a>Amendment No. 88A, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would allow the provisions limiting the effect of the direction to be waived.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-34_para14"></a>I hope that your Lordships will agree that my amendments substantially meet the concerns expressed at earlier stages by your Lordships. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60708-35_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, yes indeed, but I am never content to let the matter rest there. The noble Earl referred to my manuscript amendment, to which I should like to speak so that we may explore the point a little further. I should perhaps say now that I shall not be moving Amendment No. 88A. Amendment No. 87A seeks to amend subsection (4) of the new clause set out in Amendment No. 87 and to add at the end of that subsection:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or if it appears to him that notwithstanding such exclusion or modification the authority will be able reasonably to discharge their housing functions under this Part". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para0"></a>Perhaps I may put it a little more simply. If an authority can discharge its functions even if it uses ordinary accommodation--in other words, stock other <P>


<a name="column_135"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than hostel or short-life accommodation--it should be able to do so. I do not believe that my amendment threatens what the Government are attempting to do, and although the Minister dismissed the point, I hope that it warrants a little consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may move Amendment No. 88 and speak to the others in the group, including the substantive amendment, Amendment No. 87. I should like to explain that when we pressed this in Committee and talked about the two in three-year rule, what we were not seeking to do was to have a short-cut, in the phrase the Minister used again tonight, into "long-term housing". Certainly from my own knowledge, local authorities who use their own stock as temporary housing use hard-to-let housing, which is unattractive and very often unacceptable to those on the waiting list. Homeless families going into that hard-to-let housing are not in competition with families on the waiting list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para1"></a>There may be exceptions to that, but that is generally done. I hope that the Minister accepts it from us so that there are no more suggestions that we are somehow trying to subvert the Bill, make short-cuts, queue-jump and the rest of it: we are not. We are saying that, where there is hard-to-let housing, local authorities choose to use it in such cases, possibly because there is a shortage of private rented housing. Those people who are allocated such housing should not come within the two in three-year rule. They are not in competition with those seeking permanent housing from the waiting list.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para2"></a>However, it is indeed true that we welcome the Government's modest concession, following the debates that we have had. We on these Benches are pleased that the Government recognised that there was a black hole, so to speak, for a few--I hope only a few--hard-to-house families. It means, in other words, that the local authorities will no longer be required to evict from their own temporary housing a hard-to-house family which has not yet come to the top of the queue in two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para3"></a>There are a couple of points which I hope that the Minister will be able to answer. The first concerns the working of the extension by one year. The Minister has said that it could be three years out of four, or four years out of five: in other words, each and every extension would have to be negotiated with the Secretary of State. We are grateful to the Minister for having made the position clear. However, I should like to ask the Minister why he is binding himself in primary legislation so unnecessarily. Our amendment would remove subsection (5). I would actually be happy with a more modest amendment, to which we might return on Third Reading: to leave out the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which shall not exclude one year."</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In other words, it means that the Secretary of State, whether he wants to or not, has to limit the local authority's use of this for one year, except where it may be extended by his express consent for a further year. I can understand why the Secretary of State may wish to limit local authorities in what they can do by saying,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for such period as the Secretary of State may determine" <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_136"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 136</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
but I do not understand why he has to bind himself in primary legislation. I have been puzzling over this amendment for some time, but of course we are dealing tonight with some 80 government amendments out of the 122 tabled and it is actually quite difficult to be sure that we understand all the ramifications.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para4"></a>It seems to me, if I understand it correctly, that the regional office will have to consider each and every case, each and every family and examine each and every case file before permitting local authorities to house that family for an additional year in their own hard-to-let housing. Really? Let me put some figures to the Minister. I could be wrong, but somewhere between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. of homeless families will not come to the head of the waiting list in two years: 60 per cent. of those are likely to be in London and they are not usually housed in the local authority's own stock, simply because the pressure in London is so much greater than outside. But outside London for the 40 per cent. most local authorities will use their own hard-to-let housing as temporary accommodation for homeless families apart from bed and breakfast accommodation. I calculate that between 5,000 and 10,000 individual families--it may be the lower figure--will need to have an exemption offered to them by the local authority, if it is thought reasonable. To get that exemption the local authority will have to seek consent from the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State--or the regional DoE officers--will have to assess between 5,000 to 10,000 case histories a year in addition to the normal workload. They will become assistant housing managers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para5"></a>Is this a sensible use of officer time at regional DoE headquarters? How do the Government expect to find efficiency savings if they throw 5,000-plus extra cases each and every year at the DoE? There may be up to 1,000 at each regional office. Are the regional offices so overstaffed that they can absorb that work without difficulty? Where will the Government find efficiency savings? It is daft to ask regional officers, acting as untrained surrogate assistant housing managers, without the necessary skills and qualifications and possibly all the case notes before them, to do this on a case-by-case basis for up to 10,000 homeless families each and every year. It is an absurd waste of highly trained expensive official time. These officers will be doing something for which they are not qualified.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para6"></a>I believe that what is required is either the amendment that was narrowly defeated in this House, which would leave the matter to local authority discretion, or the ability of individual local authorities to make application to the Secretary of State in the light of local circumstances for a general dispensation. If a local authority has a general problem it needs a general dispensation. That should be granted by the Secretary of State. He should not bind himself in primary legislation by limiting that discretion to one year only. We wonder whether the Government understand the caseload implication of the amendment as it stands, unless there are category exemptions as opposed to individual case history exemptions. The workload is more than that which is dealt with by two or three average local authorities in a year.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-35_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I speak to Amendment No.87, which I welcome. There does not appear to be much commonsense in putting someone out of a hard-to-let property which is not needed by anyone else. It is not desirable to move people unnecessarily from such a property. I strongly support the Government's view that there should not be yet another way to enable people to jump the queue by a loophole of this kind. I and other noble Lords feel strongly about this. No doubt the Minister will say whether or not the words of the amendment mean exactly what I believe they mean.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para7"></a>I believe that the amendment will address inner city areas, particularly in London, about which I have spoken. As I understand it, there would be no question of the Government or any person having to act as a surrogate housing officer to deal with individual cases. I agree that that would be impossible. I imagine it is intended that local authorities will apply for an exemption--the word "dispensation" has been used by the noble Baroness--either for a category of person or a particular hard-to-let area of accommodation. There would be ways of simplifying the situation rather than having to deal with the 5,000 or 10,000 cases to which reference has been made. It is interesting that when we debated this matter earlier the tiny number of cases then referred to has suddenly grown enormously tonight. When I spoke against the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, which was so narrowly defeated, certainly there was no mention of 5,000 to 10,000 cases. But tonight it seems that that figure suits her and therefore it has come back again. However, I welcome the fact that the two years could become three years in really necessary cases and cases where the accommodation would otherwise be surplus and perhaps unused by anyone. Also, my noble friend the Minister did say that the authority could apply for even further time beyond the three years. That shows great flexibility and sensitivity whatever the situation may be. I support Amendment No. 87.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-35_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes for supporting Amendment No.87. I am glad also that I was able to clear up some concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, about whether we could have three years out of four, or four years out of five. I am glad that she understands that. The noble Baroness asked why we bind ourselves in primary legislation. The purpose of primary legislation is, of course, to set the direction of a policy and not to give the Secretary of State unfettered discretion. Indeed, I do not think that that is what the noble Earl, Lord Russell, wants either.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para8"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said that the regional office would have to handle every case. She referred to 5,000 or 10,000 cases and said we must be "absolutely daft" to introduce such legislation. I quite agree; we would be absolutely daft if we had introduced such legislation. I can assure her that we have not. Perhaps I can explain why.
<P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para9"></a>Most local authorities will not need to apply for the extension. If they do, they will apply en bloc for a class of family, not for individual cases. As an example, one might say that they had run out of houses for families requiring four bedrooms. It is those categories that would be applied for. They would be applied for en bloc, not in individual cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para10"></a>The direction will therefore apply to categories of household type, where necessary. I remind the noble Baroness of what I said earlier. The waiver would apply to specified types of applicant; for example, large families or people requiring specially adapted housing. It might last for up to a year and would have the effect of extending the two years in three provision to a three years in four provision. If an authority wished to extend the period further it would have to apply for a new direction and demonstrate that it still needed the flexibility which a direction would allow. That would refer, as I say, to classes of housing as opposed to individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para11"></a>I turn to the manuscript amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. As I explained earlier, local authorities should seek to use their older stock, wherever possible, for meeting long-term needs. We believe such needs are most effectively addressed through the housing register. There should be no need for an authority to use its own stock to house people under the provisions of Part VII for long periods. If their needs are of a long-term nature, these should be reflected by their position on the housing register. If an authority consistently finds that people whom it has rehoused in its own stock under the homelessness duty are still there after two years, this could be because it has set aside too much of its stock for short-term use, because it has framed its allocation scheme incorrectly or because it has failed to plan for needs of certain types of household in its housing strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para12"></a>Only if these circumstances do not apply--where, for example, there is a shortage of a particular type of property such as housing with four or more bedrooms--will a direction be appropriate. We believe that the direction-making power should only be used in limited circumstances; for example, in the case of applicants requiring specially adapted housing where an authority would otherwise be unable to carry out its duties effectively. We think that it should be regarded as a temporary measure, subject to annual review, to deal with the circumstances which happen to prevail at the time. It is not intended to provide a general or a continuing exception.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para13"></a>I refer also to Amendment No. 89, which strengthens the provisions governing out-of-area placements. Clause 191 allows authorities to secure accommodation for homeless applicants outside their district should they so wish. We should prefer to see authorities placing people within their own areas but we accept that there are circumstances in which that may not be possible. Therefore, we do not wish to prohibit an authority from securing accommodation for applicants outside its area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para14"></a>Amendment No. 90 replaces the provisions in Schedule 15 relating to the type of tenancy which may be offered under the new duty. Under Schedule 15, if a <P>


<a name="column_139"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>registered social landlord offers to provide housing for someone in discharge of an authority's duties under this part, the tenancy will not be assured. My right honourable friend the Minister responsible for housing indicated that it was our intention to reconsider that provision, and Amendment No. 90 provides that, generally, landlords may provide assured tenancies for people being assisted with accommodation under this part.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-35_para15"></a>I hope that I have been able to allay some of the fears of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. Even though I have not been able to agree with the manuscript amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I hope that she will understand the reasons why we think that it would not be suitable.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-36_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment deals again with the issue of suitability and would have the effect of requiring local housing authorities to satisfy themselves, when they consider whether private rented accommodation is suitable, that the landlord and the landlord's managing agent do not have a record of offences for harassment or illegal eviction under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. They would have to consult their records, their legal departments and tenancy relations officers about the record or lack of record of the landlord.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-36_para9"></a>We have discussed suitability in terms of the physical provision of the accommodation in question. This amendment addresses the management of the accommodation. It is perhaps rather late to go into great detail, but I ask your Lordships to exercise some imagination to understand that some landlords--and I do not begin to suggest that all landlords are bad--can harass tenants in quite imaginative ways. For example, they may pay constant visits without warning at unsocial hours; offer money to tenants to get out; make threats--that is an obvious strategy; allow the property to get into a state of such disrepair that it is dangerous to stay there; cut off services; start building works and leave them unfinished--that must be a particularly distressing form of harassment--or harass tenants because of their age, sex or sexual orientation. In 1990 the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys found that 9 per cent. of private tenants could have experienced some form of harassment or attempted illegal eviction.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-36_para10"></a>Having read of a number of examples of harassment, one in particular reminded me of how tenants might have felt. A tenant returned to her property and found the agent had let himself in and was using her vacuum cleaner to hoover up. She did not think agents were allowed to enter a tenant's house without asking. When I was a student I rented a flat. I recall the landlord letting himself in, repainting the kitchen and painting round the towel that was hanging on the back of the kitchen door. I would not have classed that as harassment, but I felt affronted by it. That is perhaps a minor example of the breed. I may joke about that, but the issue is a serious one. I beg to move.

<a name="column_142"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibility to make sure the flat of the noble Baroness was kept in a clean and proper condition. The noble Baroness has asked us to exercise our imaginations as regards the amendment. Normally I regard my imagination as rather like that of a fossilised potato chip, but to exercise my imagination at this hour of the day will be a struggle, but I shall do the best I can.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-36_para11"></a>Clause 192 sets out matters which must be taken into account by an authority in determining whether accommodation is suitable for use in the discharge of its functions under this part. My noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish spoke at considerable length during Committee stage about what the clause does. I do not say that in a derogatory way as it was important that he spoke at considerable length. Broadly speaking, Clause 192 re-enacts provisions contained in Section 69 of the Housing Act 1985. Section 69, which we introduced in order to strengthen the homelessness provisions, requires authorities to have regard to the parts of that Act which deal with slum clearance, overcrowding and houses in multiple occupation. In addition, we are taking new order-making powers which will allow the Secretary of State to specify circumstances in which accommodation is or is not to be regarded as suitable for someone; and matters which are to be taken into account or disregarded in determining whether accommodation is suitable for someone. These powers will provide an important safeguard for homeless people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-36_para12"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would require an authority to have regard to whether the landlord has been convicted of harassment or illegal eviction under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. I would be the last to underestimate the distress that harassment or illegal eviction must cause to tenants who are subjected to it, but it is important, in considering the noble Baroness's proposals, to put the problem in its proper context. The Survey of English Housing reports that the vast majority of tenants say they are on good terms with their landlords. Only a small minority of landlords are likely to harass their tenants or take illegal action to get them to move, or paint kitchens while their tenants' towels are hanging on the towel rail.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-36_para13"></a>The proper disclosure of relevant information about convictions is a matter which the Government take seriously. However, there would be serious practical difficulties in putting into practice the proposal envisaged by the noble Baroness. The police are responsible for carrying out criminal record checks and they are already hard pressed to meet the existing demand for checks within the constraints of the resources available to them. If we were to accept this proposal, it would further increase the pressure on the police.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-36_para14"></a>As the House will be aware, the Government recently published a White Paper on the disclosure of information from criminal records for employment and related purposes. I believe that provisions on disclosure in the circumstances described by the noble Baroness might best be considered in the context of the proposals <P>

("( ) In particular, the authority shall not consider accommodation in a house in multiple occupation suitable for a person unless the house is registered under a registration scheme, as provided for in Part XI of the Housing Act 1985.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 93 amends Clause 192 as regards the question of suitability. It proposes that an authority shall not consider accommodation in a house in multiple occupation to be suitable unless it is registered under a registration scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para3"></a>It will remain within every local authority's discretion whether or not to make a registration scheme for HMOs in its area. The amendment requires certain conditions to be met before such registration. Therefore one would hope to set a minimum standard.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para4"></a>I anticipate that the Minister may say that the Bill makes registration schemes a matter for discretion. Perhaps I may use the amendment to ask him what guidance the Secretary of State will be giving in the order provided for under Clause 192 in respect of houses in multiple occupation. I imagine that the Secretary of State has it in mind to give specific guidance. Unless he outlaws the use of HMOs for homeless households, in particular families with children, then by definition he will consider such accommodation suitable. I have reservations about whether HMOs are suitable. Therefore the use and content of guidance concern me. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-37_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, as your Lordships know, Part II of the Bill contains a package of provisions designed to achieve a marked improvement in the condition of houses in multiple occupation. The package contains a number of separate provisions. There has been considerable debate in your Lordships' House and in another place about whether local authorities should be required to introduce a registration or licensing scheme to cover all houses in multiple occupation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para5"></a>The Government's view is that local authorities are being given a wide range of powers to enforce standards in houses in multiple occupation and that they should retain a discretion about whether or not to introduce a registration scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para6"></a>I believe that the provisions in Part II of the Bill will bring about a substantial improvement in the standard of houses in multiple occupation. The noble Baroness's amendment is therefore unnecessary. I also think that it would be inappropriate to impose the <P>


<a name="column_144"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>type of restrictions envisaged by the noble Baroness's amendment on the discharge of an authority's homelessness functions. This could limit the amount of accommodation available--much of it perfectly adequate--which authorities would be able to use in the discharge of their functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para7"></a>The general guidance on suitability will apply to houses in multiple occupation in the same way as it applies to all other types of occupation which an authority may use to discharge its duty. The guidance will stress the need for accommodation to be suitable. Houses in multiple occupation cover a range of properties, some poor, but many quite good.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para8"></a>We are taking order-making powers to enable us to specify the term "suitable" and will not hesitate to use the power, if necessary, to safeguard the rights of people who are accepted as homeless. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-37_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   There is some circularity in that. I shall read what the Minister said, but his point was: HMOs will be suitable if they are suitable. That is what it amounted to and I am not sure that it took us any further. In putting down the amendment, I suggest to the House that HMOs tend not to be suitable or are more likely than other forms of accommodation to be unsuitable. However, for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "60708-37_para11"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I wish also to speak to Amendments Nos. 95, 96 and 97. They all introduce a new provision which will enable the individual to have a say in where his property is moved. The new provision fulfils a commitment given by my right honourable friend the Minister for Housing in another place to accept the substance of an amendment tabled by the honourable Member for Sheffield Attercliffe, but to reconsider the drafting so that the local authority is not left with an undefinable liability which would be difficult to discharge. I believe that we have achieved that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para12"></a>The redrafting of Clause 193 and the insertion of the new clause combine to clarify the position and also to insert an important new provision.

(".--(1) The authority may for the purposes of section 193 (protection of property of homeless persons or persons threatened with homelessness)--
<BR>
(a) enter, at all reasonable times, any premises which are the usual place of residence of the applicant or which were his last usual place of residence, and
<BR>
(b) deal with any personal property of his in any way which is reasonably necessary, in particular by storing it or arranging for its storage.

(2) Where the applicant asks the authority to move his property to a particular location nominated by him, the authority--

(a) may, if it appears to them that his request is reasonable, discharge their responsibilities under section 193 by doing as he asks, and
<BR>
(b) having done so, have no further duty or power to take action under that section in relation to that property.
<BR>
If such a request is made, the authority shall before complying with it inform the applicant of the consequence of their doing so.
<BR>
(3) If no such request is made (or, if made, is not acted upon) the authority cease to have any duty or power to take action under section 193 when, in their opinion, there is no longer any reason to believe that there is a danger of loss of or damage to a person's personal property by reason of his inability to protect it or deal with it.
<BR>
But property stored by virtue of their having taken such action may be kept in store and any conditions upon which it was taken into store continue to have effect, with any necessary modifications.
<BR>
(4) Where the authority--
<BR>
(a) cease to be subject to a duty to take action under section 193 in respect of an applicant's property, or
<BR>
(b) cease to have power to take such action, having previously taken such action,

they shall notify the applicant of that fact and of the reason for it.

("(1A) Where a social services authority request a relevant housing authority or body to assist them in the discharge of their functions under the Children Act 1989 or in the provision of community care services, the authority or body to whom the request is made shall co-operate in securing that accommodation is available for the benefit of any person (including a child) in respect of whom the request is made or in rendering such other assistance as is reasonable in the circumstances.

(1B) Where a social services authority which is also a local housing authority is subject to a duty to provide community care services or services under the Children Act 1989 for the benefit of any person (including a child), and the authority determines that such services comprise or include the provision of accommodation for that person, the authority shall secure that suitable accommodation is available for occupation by that person.
<BR>
(1C) In this section "community care services" has the same meaning as in section 46(3) of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 (which for the avoidance of doubt, shall include services provided under section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970.)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am sorry that this amendment comes so late, perhaps we should have grouped it more brutally. Even though it is late I still wish to air the issue. The amendment concerns co-operation. As we know, it is not just housing departments who have housing responsibilities. Social services may have them as a way of discharging functions under the Children Act 1989; social services may also have a housing function as part of the community care package.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para18"></a>I think we all agree that it is essential that housing services should avoid being splintered. It is essential that housing policy be integrated with social services child care and community care policies, otherwise, some of the most vulnerable, homeless children and those who are mentally and physically ill may slip into the gap between providing authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para19"></a>Section 17 of the Children Act states that a local authority has the general duty to promote the welfare of children, including providing them and their families, if appropriate, with accommodation. Section 20 includes an explicit additional duty for the local authority to care for homeless children of 16 or 17. The local authority can meet those duties with its own accommodation or by ensuring that privately registered accommodation is available. Similarly, under the National Assistance Act 1948 the local authority may make available residential accommodation for those who are vulnerable through age, disability or illness. In other words, most children and most vulnerable people come within the categories of allocation policies in Part VI, but not all of them--and those others remain the responsibility of social services.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para20"></a>Perhaps I may give some examples of those remaining at risk. There are the children of parents who become intentionally homeless. Perhaps the family fails to keep up mortgage repayments which a reasonable person might judge they could pay. There are the children of someone who is homeless and who has refused an offer deemed suitable by the local authority. There are children fleeing, for example, racial harassment, where the local authority believes it is reasonable that the family should continue to live in their former accommodation but the family does not. Another example would be a 16 year-old who has left home following family breakdown, whom the local authority does not accept as vulnerable. Someone may need accommodation suited to his disability or to support from a carer but is nonetheless not regarded as homeless by a local authority. There may be a case where a single person has been discharged from a psychiatric or other hospital whom the local authority <P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has not accepted as vulnerable. An asylum seeker may have applied in country, be destitute, have serious medical, physical or psychiatric problems, have no income, be unable to work, have nowhere to live and fall within community care responsibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para21"></a>I have listed just eight examples. I could add many more. All of those groups might be entitled to help from social services, even though they had been refused help by housing departments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para22"></a>What happens then? Either social services have to become a housing department as well, and may therefore need to acquire a stock of dwellings or may need to place people in bed-and-breakfast accommodation; or we need to ensure that co-operative arrangements are in place. Co-operative arrangements, while desirable, are especially difficult where there is not a unitary authority. All social services can do is make a request, under Section 27 of the Children Act, or invite help under community care arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para23"></a>I remind the noble Earl of the case of R. v. Northavon District Council ex parte Smith 1994. The House of Lords held that Northavon District Council was entitled to refuse a request by Avon County Council social services department for assistance in housing a family with young children on the basis that the family was intentionally homeless.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para24"></a>This amendment would allow local authorities' social services departments to acquire and secure effective co-operation from housing departments while still leaving it open to the housing authorities to decide whether or not to secure accommodation or help social services in some other way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para25"></a>At the moment the requirement of housing departments to respond to a social services request is too weak given the responsibility of social services under the Children Act and under community care. This amendment would strengthen the position of social services vis-a-vis housing departments and therefore, I hope, ensure that co-operation follows. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-37_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the most remarkable example of inconsistent provision I know was in the regulations for the Civil Service in Northern Ireland about 30 years ago. Women in the Northern Irish Civil Service were allowed up to three children--but they were not allowed to be married. That is the result of applying to them the regulations about children which were designed originally for men while putting in a separate regulation prohibiting marriage. I am thankful to say that that is no longer the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-37_para26"></a>These particular cases of inconsistent provision are mostly ones about which I remember my noble friend Lady Seear warning the House during the 1990 National Health Service and Community Care Act. Most of the fears she then expressed have proved to be justified. The purpose of the noble Baroness's amendment is only to connect. I think it is good advice and I am happy to support it.

<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way. To think that he found out that the Northern Irish civil servants could have three children but they must not be married seems to me quite extraordinary. I cannot think how he found that out. I can only assume it was what he found out when his tutor told him to go down to the Bodleian Library.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-38_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, it so happens that my best man was the son of a Northern Irish civil servant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-38_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, that casts quite a lot of doubt somewhere, but I am not quite sure where. Perhaps we had better address ourselves to the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para0"></a>Under Clause 194 there is a specific duty of co-operation between local authorities and social service authorities. The Children Act of 1989 already incorporates the provisions sought by the amendment, specifically in respect of young people. Section 27 allows a social services authority to call on the assistance of a housing authority in discharging a duty to a young person. The housing authority is also under a duty to comply in such circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para1"></a>Community care is dealt with under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, to which the amendment refers. Section 46 of that Act includes a specific requirement that local housing authorities are to be consulted in the drawing up of plans for community care services. It is for these reasons that we feel that the points which the noble Baroness seeks to cover are already covered. We do not regard the provisions which are sought by the amendment to be necessary. They are in statute already. That is why I hope the noble Baroness will realise, despite her indicating dissent, no doubt as a result of a discussion with the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that I cannot advise the House to accept the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. I wonder whether he has checked the wording of the Children Act or the community care Act of 1990. I invite him, in all seriousness, to do so before Third Reading. My understanding is that currently all that social service authorities can do is to request co-operation. That request can be ignored. Social services have no come-back. They request co-operation under the Children Act; they invite co-operation under the National Health Service and Community Care Act. And that request can be ignored.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para2"></a>That is my reading of the situation. If I am wrong I am very happy to be corrected by the Minister. The Northavon case I quoted to the Minister upheld the housing authority's right to ignore the request. The amendment says that where a request is made the housing authority shall co-operate. It does not mean that it has to agree. But it may not ignore. It must consider and shall co-operate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para3"></a>Obviously, at this time of night I shall be seeking permission to withdraw the amendment, but I ask the Minister to assure himself that the wording in the Children Act and the community care Act does what he believes it to do. I do not believe it does. If I am wrong I am genuinely happy to be corrected and have my fears <P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>laid to rest. Certainly, court cases suggest that my fears are well founded and that social services do not have the leverage that the noble Earl and I would like. If the Minister wishes to intervene I would welcome his doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-38_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, if I may have the leave of the House, the noble Baroness makes a perfectly reasonable request. She asks me to look at what she has said and to check over the two Acts; I shall certainly do so.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para23"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the provision of alarm systems to people living in council areas. I moved the amendment at Committee stage. It seeks to regularise a position which exists at the present moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para24"></a>Councils up and down the country provide such alarm systems not only to their own tenants but to housing association tenants as well as home owners. There is considerable doubt as to whether they can charge for that service from those who are not council tenants. The doubts have been expressed by the Audit Commission, which has not yet mounted a challenge. But the auditors are warning the councils to be careful in case such a challenge is mounted in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para25"></a>When I brought forward this amendment on the previous occasion, my noble friend Lord Lucas assured me that there would be a consultation process which would start shortly. He has since very kindly written to me, putting forward one or two points about which he was concerned in the amendment which I brought forward earlier. They were points about whether the alarm systems should be restricted to the vulnerable and the elderly, whether they should be provided in the area of the council by that particular council and whether there could perhaps be more flexibility about their provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para26"></a>The amendment before your Lordships seeks to include those points. Since then, the agency has also consulted the other councils, local authority associations, the AMA, the ACC and indeed the social services. They have also taken into account the fact that alarm systems can be provided to anyone living in any particular council area by any council at all. There are <P>


<a name="column_151"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>quite a lot of partnership schemes taking place at the moment where one particular council specialises in the provision of the systems while the others take advantage of the provision. It would be detrimental to local authorities if such partnership schemes could not go ahead. In my council of Windsor and Maidenhead, the systems are provided by Wrekin and it works far better because it can be much more cost effective. We would not wish in any way to confuse the issue on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para27"></a>There is very little more that I can usefully add to what I said on the last occasion, except to emphasise that this is a totally benign amendment. It seeks to regularise an existing position. It enforces nothing; no one is forced to have such an alarm system. It gives local authorities the opportunity and ability to provide such a system. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60708-38_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, I supported this amendment at Committee stage and put my name to it on this occasion. As my noble friend said, Amendment No. 108 is purely an enabling amendment. It states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A local housing authority may provide"; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
it is not compulsory; it is only permissive. Subsection (2) provides that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A local housing authority may make facilities provided by it under subsection (1) above available for use by such persons as the authority thinks fit". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para28"></a>After Committee stage my noble friend was kind enough to send me a copy of his letter to my noble friend Lady Flather. I understand that the provision of community alarm systems is not simply a housing issue. However, as he wrote, local housing authorities can provide alarm systems for their tenants. Social services authorities, whether or not they be housing authorities as well, may provide the systems to certain defined vulnerable groups.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-38_para29"></a>The provision exists in bits. It is like the curate's egg: some is good and some is not so good. I suggest to my noble friend that he takes this opportunity to accept the amendment and, if he needs to, he can amend it on Third Reading to cover the aspects with which he is not entirely happy. Alternatively, he may give an undertaking that he will bring forward his own amendment on Third Reading. As I said in Committee, it seems daft not to take the amendment on board at this stage. When are we next going to have a Bill in which this provision can be included? I do not see another one coming up for a very long time. I should grasp the opportunity now and run with it. I strongly support the amendment.

<A NAME="60708-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I, too, hope that the Minister will be able to support the amendment moved so persuasively by his noble friend Lady Flather. This is a grey area of law. Local authorities want their position clarified so that they can do what they judge is best in their interests, without fearing that they may meet some legal challenge under the auditor's procedure.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para0"></a>I hope that the Government do not drag their feet any further. The amendment is not ideological; it is not contentious; it is entirely discretionary. It allows local authorities to recoup some of their costs. I hope that the Government can do as the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, said: accept the amendment and, if necessary, adjust it at Third Reading if in any sense it is technically deficient. That would be a great delight--to use the Minister's words--to local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-39_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, at this time of night I say only that this amendment enjoys support in every quarter of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am therefore very sorry not to be providing a midnight delight for all our delectations. I listened carefully to the arguments of my noble friend and all other noble Lords in support of the amendment. But this clause is not the right way forward on this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para1"></a>The present statutory position is that the law is clear that local housing authorities can provide alarm systems for their tenants. Equally, the law is clear that social services authorities can provide such facilities to certain defined vulnerable groups. At root, the concern of the local authority associations, as explained by my noble friend, is that the law is not clear about local authorities providing community alarms in any other situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para2"></a>To resolve this lack of clarity, we need first to address a number of fundamental questions, and this we are doing. In essence, we need to decide which local authorities should be able to provide community alarms. Should, for example, all local authorities--counties, districts, unitaries, and perhaps police authorities--be able to provide alarms or should it be restricted to certain authorities? Should authorities be able to provide this service to anyone resident in their area, or should provision be restricted to certain vulnerable groups or specific categories such as local authority tenants as at present? Should authorities be able to provide and charge for alarms to people outside their area or to business people? How would any general power to provide community alarms interact with authorities' other responsibilities in the fields of housing, social services and crime prevention? Should there be any restriction on precisely the kind of system which local authorities can provide? How would we define this adequately? What is the role of the private sector, and would it be right for local authorities to compete in the market for electronic communication systems?
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para3"></a>It is these and other questions that we are addressing. We have not yet reached our conclusions nor, would it seem, has the noble Baroness. Once we have completed our work, it is our intention to consult the local authority associations and other interested parties on our conclusions, including any proposals for legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para4"></a>My noble friend's amendment does not address the full range of issues. It is silent about authorities which are not housing authorities. On the other hand, it would open up the possibility of a particular class of local authority (housing authorities) being able to trade throughout the country in a market for emergency communication systems. That is a very broad term. <P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Although we have not yet completed our analysis, we do not see a case for such wide ranging powers. My noble friend Lord Swinfen invited us to join the permissive society or, at least, this aspect of it. We do not feel ready to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para5"></a>We are committed, as both I and my right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Regeneration have made clear, to resolving the present legal uncertainties. It is our aim that these should be resolved in a commonsense and practical way, ensuring that local authorities have the powers they need to provide those community alarm services, which would be best provided by local government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para6"></a>I do not argue with my noble friend's description of the present situation being like the curate's egg. We are committed to arriving at the bishop's chicken, which I believe will be tasty throughout and altogether a better developed bird. This amendment does not achieve that. I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw it. I understand her disappointment at our not being in a position to move ahead now on this matter, but there is a great deal of work that remains to be done. A great deal of consultation is required before we can go ahead. There is not the time in the time scale of this Bill to enable us to do that. I am sure and confident that in due course there will be other legislative opportunities to incorporate our conclusions in legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House and before the Minister sits down, perhaps he can answer this question. He said that further consultation is needed and that a legislative opportunity will present itself to the House. I am not quite sure why he has that confidence. He may be telling us something about the Queen's Speech in the autumn. If the Government were persuaded of the substance of the amendment, particularly following consultation with the local authorities who, I am sure, will say the same as has been argued here today, is there any way that they can amend the situation by regulation or will it require primary legislation? To stress the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, when will the opportunity present itself? Can the Minister help on that? Is there some possibility that it does not require the vehicle of primary legislation to address this matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am sad at not being able to enliven this late hour with a description of what will be in the Queen's Speech. I have no knowledge of it. The noble Baroness is usually ahead of me in these matters and perhaps she is on this occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para7"></a>Legislation which can have housing aspects is not that infrequent in this House. Even in my few years here I have seen plenty of it. It is our clear understanding that primary legislation will be required to do the sort of things which it is required should be done. That illustrates the fact that we are some way short yet of reaching our conclusions on what should be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-39_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Flather: </B>   My Lords, I must express my disappointment at my noble friend's response. Given the lateness of the hour, analogies with food do not exactly <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appeal. I am sure that when they read Hansard tomorrow, some noble Lords will wonder whether what has been said is common sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para8"></a>The questions that my noble friend posed are probably totally unanswerable because, unless some direction is given, there will be no end result. Given that this matter has been on the Whitehall merry-go-round for some two years--to use my noble friend's own words--I hope that there is not to be a further two years on an even longer and larger merry-go-round. The questions that my noble friend posed lead me to fear just such a merry-go-round.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para9"></a>In the meantime, I hope that at the very least my noble friend will give local authorities an assurance of some kind that no action will be taken on what has already been done because there is a possible danger of some such action in the near future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para10"></a>Questions such as, "What about the private sector?" and, "What about other authorities?" arise. On the one hand, my noble friend said in his letter that this must not be restricted to the vulnerable and the elderly while on the other hand he himself says, "What about the private sector?". I am surprised that he did not mention that in his letter as well as extending the provisions to everyone in a local authority area.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para11"></a>I am very disappointed by what has been said and I am not filled with expectation. If all provisions had had to be subjected to that kind of nit-picking we would not have had to amend the number of Bills that we have, even in my time in this House. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60708-39_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>   moved Amendment No. 109:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Before Clause 200, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Mortgage repossessions </B></center><BR>
(".--(1) For the purposes of section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act 1970 and section 8 of the Administration of Justice Act 1973 (under which a court has power to delay giving a mortgagee possession of the mortgaged property so as to allow the mortgagor a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage) there shall be a presumption that the full remaining period of the mortgage term is the reasonable period.
<BR>
(2) The court may exercise any of its powers under this section notwithstanding that the court may have exercised its powers under this section on a previous occasion.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para13"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, it is the House's misfortune, as it is mine, that it has fallen to me to move two of the longest and most technical amendments to the Bill at 12.10 a.m. I am sorry that it is so and I shall do my best to be as fast as I can, but the material is difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para14"></a>The amendment concerns mortgage repossessions--a problem that will not go away; first, because the private sector mortgage debt is now 62 per cent. of GNP or &#163;362 billion. When this Government came into office, it was 26 per cent. of GNP. That is one reason why the feel-good factor has not come back. The second reason is the deregulated labour market. There is a potential conflict between a labour market in which people are expected to change jobs frequently and one in which they are expected to pay mortgages regularly. In fact, <P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>research from the DoE shows that 70 per cent. of repossessions are caused by job loss. In 1995, 49,410 properties were repossessed compared with only 19,300 10 years ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para15"></a>There is a conflict of legitimate interests in mortgage repossessions. The lender's interest is legitimate, as is that of the borrower, but hasty action tends to leave the lender saddled with an asset which, sold rapidly, does not generate what is wanted. A lot of action is taken in that regard which is not in anyone's interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para16"></a>Amendment No. 109 deals with the "reasonable period" set out in the 1970 Act during which mortgage arrears are to be paid off. It seeks to incorporate in statute the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society v. Norgan, which laid down that the reasonable period for clearing mortgage arrears should start from calculating the remaining term of the mortgage. Since that judgment exists, the Minister may wish to assure me that this amendment is unnecessary. I wish that were so. A great many judgments are coming out, especially in the lower courts, in ways which are wildly inconsistent with the Court of Appeal. A district judge in Lancashire recently said that he expected all arrears would normally be cleared within two years, and that four should be the maximum. That has come out since the Court of Appeal judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para17"></a>The other reason why the Court of Appeal judgment has not achieved what is required is that a great many litigants appear unrepresented. People who are suffering mortgage repossession are not normally in a good position to pay for lawyers, and in the light of forthcoming cuts in legal aid the proportion of mortgage repossession cases where the applicant is unrepresented is likely to go up. So then they become homeless and there is a considerable cost to public funds. I think there would be a great asset, in terms of consistency and security, in expressing this principle clearly in statute law. It would be easier for the lenders to become familiar with it and it would be easier for the lower court judges to become familiar with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-39_para18"></a>Obviously the lenders might wish to object that they were being asked to accept an unsecured loan, but in so far as there is negative equity that is true already. There are a lot of cases, and I fear that I must quote one or two to show how things are being done which are not in the interests of either party and where everyone would be better off if this were adopted. Take, for example, the case of a woman who was made redundant, claimed income support and was told by her lender that if she made no payment for eight weeks possession proceedings would be instituted. That would have left the lender with an expensive asset and a "fire sale" which would not realise its true value. If people are to be expected to change jobs, some arrangement must exist for tiding over intervals like that. This amendment seeks to provide that. I believe it to be in the interests of all parties and I believe it to be practical. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60708-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am a little confused as to whether the noble Lord was talking to Amendment No. 110 as well as to Amendment No. 109.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-40_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am dealing with Amendment No. 109, but I inadvertently let fall a single sentence which referred to Amendment No. 110. That was my error.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl. We share the view that unnecessary repossession should be avoided, but the courts already have the discretion which this amendment appears to try to give them. The recent Appeal Court case of Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society v. Norgan makes it clear that the remaining term of the mortgage should be taken by judges as the starting point for determining what constitutes a reasonable period for the repayment of arrears outstanding on a mortgage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para0"></a>We feel it would be unhelpful to fetter the court's discretion in the way that this amendment does. In any individual case, what constitutes a reasonable period for repayment of arrears will depend on the circumstances of that particular case. This is a matter for the judge to decide after looking into the borrower's financial circumstances and the lender's position. As I have just said, the Appeal Court has made it clear that the starting point is the remaining term of the mortgage. Obviously there will be situations where that is entirely inappropriate: where the remaining term of the mortgage is so short that no reasonable repayment can be made over it, and where the remaining term of the mortgage is very long and the borrower has other assets which can easily be sold in the reasonably short term to provide the necessary additional payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para1"></a>These are situations where the courts need the flexibility they have at present in order to make the proper decisions. It has been suggested that case law alone will not lead to a change in the practice of mortgage lenders. We see no reason why this should be so. Indeed my right honourable friend the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration has received a letter from the Director General of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which acknowledges that lenders will have to take account of the Appeal Court judgment in dealing with future arrears and possession cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para2"></a>To the extent that there is any inconsistency in the exercise of the discretion of judges as to what constitutes a reasonable period, that may be due to inadequate guidance. Perhaps the case cited by the noble Earl is an example of that. Action has been taken to remedy it. Detailed guidance is set out in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The Judicial Studies Board, which provides notes for the guidance of district judges in the exercise of their discretion, has updated the notes to alert judges to the judgment of the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para3"></a>The guidance for judges will ensure that the Court of Appeal judgment is quickly disseminated and is duly reflected in court decisions and lending practices. The noble Earl raises the question whether the <P>


<a name="column_157"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment will benefit borrowers particularly when they are not represented in court. The best way to protect borrowers is to ensure that judges hearing those cases are fully aware of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and that is already in hand. We believe the amendment to be unnecessary. I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-40_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. What he said about guidance went a long way to meeting my concern. But I ask him not to overrate the awareness of all judges, especially in lower courts, with the latest decisions. In the reign of Elizabeth I, judges discovered that for 18 years they had been hanging people under a repealed statute. I am not suggesting that any such errors occur today. But, when we consider our own inability to recollect conflicting provisions in Bills that we have passed within the past five years, we must be understanding.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para4"></a>I must ask the Minister to think seriously and consult his noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor about the cost to public funds of people who become homeless because they are unrepresented at repossession hearings. It may wipe out the whole of the saving. However, that is for the future. For the time being, I am content to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-40_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>   moved Amendment No. 110:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Before Clause 200, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Negative equity </B></center><BR>
(".--(1) The power of the court under section 91 of the Law of Property Act 1925 ("the 1925 Act") to direct a sale of mortgaged property, on such terms as it thinks fit, shall, in respect of a dwelling house or part of a dwelling house occupied by a mortgagor in possession, include power to direct a sale free of the mortgage by the mortgagor, notwithstanding that the sum secured by the mortgage exceeds the sale price, and so to direct on terms that the mortgagor shall be entitled to deduct from the gross proceeds of sale his reasonable costs and expenses of effecting the sale before accounting to the mortgagee for the net proceeds.
<BR>
(2) Where an application is made to a court by a mortgagee or any other interested person under section 91 of the 1925 Act for a direction that a mortgaged property to which subsection (1) applies be sold, the court may if it thinks fit suspend the making of the direction for a reasonable period to allow time for redemption or for the payment of any mortgage money or for sale by the mortgagor.
<BR>
(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other enactment, a County Court shall have jurisdiction under section 91 of the 1925 Act to determine an issue arising under this section whatever the amount owing in respect of the mortgage charge.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para6"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, Amendment No. 110 also deals with mortgage repossessions, in particular reasonable settlements of mortgage debts. It has three parts. It provides a power to direct a sale free of the mortgage, which means that what is left over is debt minus the net proceeds. It gives power to suspend the direction for a sale for a reasonable period. It also makes clear that jurisdiction should lie with the county court. <P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The same points made earlier about the need for reasonable settlements in the interests of all parties apply here, and I need not repeat them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para7"></a>At the moment, a considerable number of cases that are going through are not in the carefully considered interests of either party. It may be that a junior official in a bank feels a cold breath down his neck. Not every junior bank manager has the benefit of the legal advice of the noble Lord, Lord Alexander of Weedon. Let us take as an example a case in Sussex where the borrowers fell into arrears on the mortgage. They tried to agree with the lender to sell the property for &#163;115,000. They were refused permission to do so. The property was repossessed. A year later the lender sold the property for &#163;90,000. By that time arrears had increased by a further &#163;9,000. The final unsecured, unmet debt was &#163;53,000. Clearly, that was not in the interests of anybody.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para8"></a>Another case concerned a woman separated from her husband. A buyer was found for the property and an offer of &#163;19,000 was made. The lender refused to allow the sale to go through because it would not cover the outstanding loan which totalled &#163;26,000. The property was repossessed. Eventually, the lender had to sell it, not for &#163;19,000, but for &#163;9,000. That was not in the interests of the lender, borrower or anybody else. I believe that this amendment would do something to meet a very real need.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para9"></a>It was at this point that I inadvertently allowed a line about unsecured debt to wander from one amendment to another, which I believe disconcerted the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. He could see, I think, that it belongs here where it should have been in the first place. Again, there is a Court of Appeal case--the Barrett case--which bears that out. But once again district judges do not know it, unrepresented borrowers do not know it, and it is not being acted on. I hope the amendment would clear up the situation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-40_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, in the Government's view, Amendment No. 110 is unnecessary. It seeks to insert into the Bill proposals which reflect the recent decision of the High Court in the case of Barrett v. Halifax Building Society. In that case the court decided that the borrowers could sell their property to their buyer against the wishes of their lender because the lender could not in the foreseeable future improve upon the price agreed. The court therefore decided that its power to order a sale under Section 91 of the Law of Property Act 1925 was unfettered, though it was to be exercised judicially by having due regard to all the interests concerned. The court also decided that the borrowers could deduct reasonable costs of the sale before accounting to the lender.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para10"></a>The case followed the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of Palk v. Mortgage Services Funding in 1992, which decided that the court has the power to order a sale against the wishes of the lender if it was just and equitable despite the fact that the mortgage debt would remain unsecured. Again, the power has to be exercised judicially by taking account of the interests of all the parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para11"></a>The two judgments therefore make it clear that the courts already have the power to order a sale in the circumstances set out in the amendment. Furthermore, it is clear that the courts already have the power to suspend <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an order for sale to allow the owner time to negotiate a sale. The first two parts of the proposed new clause therefore add nothing to the present position under law. We are quite clear that the Council of Mortgage Lenders is fully apprised of the effects of these court cases in looking at the way in which its members should conduct their business in future. I do not have with me the guidance issued to district circuit judges as a result of the cases, but I shall obtain a copy and send it to the noble Earl before Third Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-40_para12"></a>The third part of the amendment seeks to extend the jurisdiction of the county courts in cases of this kind, regardless of the amount owed on the mortgage. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has given jurisdiction under Section 91 of the 1925 Act to the county courts where the mortgage debt does not exceed &#163;30,000. As your Lordships will know, the report of the review of civil litigation carried out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, is due to be published later this summer. As part of his review, the noble and learned Lord has been considering the appropriate forum for housing cases and the distribution of work between the High Court and the county courts. It seems to me that the appropriate course is for my noble and learned friend to be given the opportunity to take account of the aims of this part of the amendment in the context of the implementation of the recommendations of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. For all these reasons, I hope that the noble Earl will be able to withdraw the amendment.

Again, there is a problem in current cases of applying the Barrett judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-41_para0"></a> In a recent case in west London, where there was a mortgage of &#163;68,000 and arrears of &#163;8,000, the lender took possession proceedings. The client found a buyer for &#163;72,000. The lender refused to let the sale go ahead on the ground that it would not cover the outstanding debt. I think it covered far more of it than would have accrued otherwise. By making representations, the citizens advice bureau was able to persuade the lender to change its mind. But I fear that the present state of the law means that one cannot get the benefit of the Court of Appeal judgment unless one enjoys the support of a citizens advice bureau making representations. And although I am second to none in my admiration for citizens advice bureaux, it is not realistic to expect every single litigant to have one to represent him.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-41_para1"></a>I believe that the amendment does meet a need. However, the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting my concerns. I thank him for doing so and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Part X (Overcrowding) of the Housing Act 1985 is amended as follows--

(a) in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 325 for the words from "locality" to the end, substitute "as a bedroom"; and
<BR>
(b) in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 326 for the words from "locality" to the end, substitute "as a bedroom".").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60708-42_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall be extremely brief. The current standard of overcrowding concerning fitness and so on is based on the 1935 housing legislation which takes into account living rooms and not merely bedrooms, so that two adults and two children under ten would not be regarded as being overcrowded if they lived in a one-bedroom flat because the living room would be taken into account as a room available for sleeping in.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-42_para1"></a>Most local authorities have long since passed that 1935 standard and seek to use instead, perfectly properly, a bedroom standard of accommodation so that a couple with two children under the age of ten, of either the same or different sexes, would be entitled to two bedrooms rather than one. However, the legislation should be updated. It goes back to 1935 and is anachronistic. I hope that even at this late hour the Minister will undertake to tidy up this area of the law at a later stage of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-42_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I shall try to be similarly brief. I suspect that there is more to this amendment in terms of the length of the reply that I might give and the advocation which the noble Baroness might have used than we have been treated to this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-42_para2"></a>Clearly, as the noble Baroness said, this legislation was passed a long time ago. Very few houses fail even the advanced standard which she advocates and most of those are in the private rather than the rented sector. About 5 per cent. of local authority properties would fail the test which she proposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708-42_para3"></a>Turning to the subject of being homeless by reason of overcrowding--if I may phrase it that way--if accommodation is not available for occupation, a person is considered to be homeless. Overcrowding is a factor which can properly be taken into account in this context, but there is no requirement to take into account the definition of overcrowding in Part X of the Housing Act 1985. It would be my understanding therefore that there would be no need to amend the 1985 Act--with all the ramifications that might have for enforcement of this legislation in private housing and other areas--in order to deal with the problem the noble Baroness has raised on how this would apply to the homelessness legislation. It is a subject I should be happy to discuss with the noble Baroness before Third Reading if she thinks there is something further that needs to be gone into.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708-42_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that offer. I accept that it is late at night, but if I may I should like to receive a fairly full letter from the Minister on this subject, because it is absurd to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>operate dual standards--a bedroom standard, whichhow local authorities allocate; and a living room standard by which they determine whether or not a family is in overcrowded housing, and therefore comes within everything from HMOs to being on the route to homelessness. We need to explore this matter further, but I accept the Minister's gracious offer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

This is clear from the implementation procedures adopted in April 1995. Consequently, if we are to give the procedures every chance of success in improving compliance by member states with their commitments--eg, to respect human rights--supporting documentation needs to be handled in the same way. It is for this reason that we do not support the release to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Secretary General's factual overview. We would agree however that the Parliamentary Assembly should be kept informed generally of progress.

<FONT SIZE=3>18th June. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport represented the United Kingdom on the first day and I did so on the second.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w01_para0"></a>The Council took a vote on one item, a mandate for the Commission to open negotiations with the United States on the regulatory framework for a possible future EU/US common aviation area. This was opposed by the United Kingdom but was approved with the support of other member states. The mandate is restricted to negotiations on "soft rights" such as competition rules and ownership and control of airlines. Any second stage, including a mandate for negotiations on "hard rights" such as market access, would require a separate Council decision. Member states retain the right to conduct bilateral negotiations with the US while Community level negotiations are under way.

<A NAME = "60708w01_para1"></a>The Council reached agreement with the European Parliament in the conciliation procedure on guidelines for the trans-European transport network.

<A NAME = "60708w01_para3"></a>The Council discussed a directive to extend until 2001 the present arrangements for harmonisation of summer time start and end dates, but deferred a decision until its October meeting.

The Government's role is to help create a flexible labour market and a skilled and adaptable workforce, so that employees affected by restructuring of enterprises can find new work quickly. The Labour Force Survey shows an increase in employment of 733,000 in Great Britain since winter 1992-93.

<A NAME = "60708w02_sbhd2"></A><H4><center>International Whaling Commission Meeting, 24th-28th June</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708w02_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What was the outcome of the International Whaling Commission meeting held in Aberdeen on 24th-28th June 1996.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60708w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   The International Whaling Commission's 48th annual meeting was held in Aberdeen from 24th to 28th June. The UK delegation was composed of officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, assisted by officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of the Environment and representatives of environmental organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para29"></a>The United Kingdom's principal objective at this meeting was to ensure that the moratorium on commercial whaling, which has been in force since 1986, was not weakened in any way. I am pleased to report that this was achieved. A request by Japan for a quota of 50 minke whales for its coastal communities, which we and many others considered would have breached the moratorium, was once again rejected. The UK's opening statement made it clear that we would continue to oppose all efforts to end the moratorium.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para30"></a>The UK and New Zealand put forward a proposal for a ban on the use of the electric lance, which is used to kill whales that are wounded, but not killed, by an explosive harpoon. Although this received a wide measure of support; it did not secure the majority of three-quarters of those voting needed for adoption under <P>


<a name="column_WA7"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column WA7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>IWC rules. However, it was clear that our argument that the electric lance is inhumane was widely accepted; even many of those who voted against a formal ban did not favour continued use of the electric lance. Japan, while continuing to defend its use of the electric lance, indicated that it planned to undertake research into possible alternatives and would be reporting the results to the next IWC meeting. The IWC will be returning to this issue then.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para31"></a>The United States presented a proposal for an aboriginal subsistence whaling quota of five grey whales for its Makah Indian Tribe, and the Russian Federation sought a quota of five bowhead whales for indigenous peoples in Siberia. Both proposals aroused a good deal of concern, and as discussions progressed it became evident that neither was likely to obtain the three-quarters majority needed for adoption. In these circumstances, both the United States and the Russian Federation withdrew their proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para32"></a>Little progress was made on developing a Revised Management Scheme (RMS), which is being devised to regulate all aspects of any future commercial whaling which might be permitted in the future. The United Kingdom continues to participate constructively in this work, as we believe that if commercial whaling ever did resume it would be essential to have in place tough and enforceable procedures to ensure that whaling only took place on stocks that were at healthy levels and was on a fully sustainable basis. The IWC did, however, endorse new guidelines on carrying out surveys and on calculating estimates of whale numbers; it also agreed new procedures designed to ensure better IWC oversight of these activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para33"></a>At the Scientific Committee Meeting there was a lengthy discussion of new estimates of minke whale numbers in the North East Atlantic. The Committee eventually agreed that the most recent estimate, derived from a survey carried out in 1995, was adequate for use in the Revised Management Procedure (the part of a future RMS under which catch limits for a particular stock would be calculated) and Norway claimed that this justified its decision to increase the number of whales it is planning to take this year under its commercial whaling operations. Most countries, however, continue <P>


<a name="column_WA8"></a>

<B>8 Jul 1996 : Column WA8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to believe that Norway's whaling activities weaken both the moratorium and the authority of the IWC, and a resolution was adopted by a large majority calling on Norway to reconsider its objection to the moratorium (under which Norway is legally entitled to continue commercial whaling) and to halt all commercial whaling operations immediately. The UK strongly supported this resolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para34"></a>We also supported a resolution calling on Japan to stop its scientific whaling and, in particular, to halt all scientific whaling within the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. Again, this was adopted by a very large majority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para35"></a>In the Scientific Committee the outcome of the recent workshop on the effects of climate change on cetaceans was discussed, and steps were agreed to take forward work in this important issue. These were fully endorsed by the IWC itself through a resolution adopted by consensus. It was agreed, in particular, that the Scientific Committee would set up a standing working group to co-ordinate its work on environmental change, and that it would seek increased co-operation with other international organisations working in this field.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para36"></a>A number of other issues were discussed during this meeting. The UK introduced a resolution on small cetaceans, which was adopted by consensus, drawing attention to earlier resolutions on threatened species of small cetaceans and encouraging the Scientific Committee to continue to identify species under threat and to advise on possible remedial action. A resolution was adopted on whalewatching; this endorsed guidelines proposed by the Scientific Committee and drew these to the attention of coastal states responsible for regulating whalewatching. Resolutions were also adopted on improving controls on trade in whalemeat and calling on Canada, which withdrew from the IWC in 1982, to rejoin the IWC if it wishes to authorise aboriginal subsistence whaling.
<P>

<A NAME = "60708w02_para37"></a>Overall, this was a satisfactory meeting for the UK, and we achieved most of our objectives. While we were not successful in securing a ban on the use of the electric lance, we made encouraging progress and are well placed to take the issue up again next year at the IWC's 49th annual meeting, which will take place in Monaco in October 1997.
