<a name="50622-01_head0"></a><H3><center>Sexual Offences: Anonymity for Defendants</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will introduce legislation to provide that the same protection from publicity be given to defendants accused of sexual offences, unless and until convicted, as the law gives to complainants in such cases.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, we have no plans to do so. We believe that the present law, which affords anonymity for complainants in sexual offence cases but offers no special protection for defendants, strikes a balance between the principle of open justice and the need to ensure that victims of sexual offences are encouraged to come forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the Minister appreciates the complexity of the issue. However, is she aware that it is simply not true that the acquittal of men charged with rape leads to the public vindication of them because of the overwhelming and often prurient publicity which scorches the lives of anyone named in a rape case whether he is innocent or guilty? While I am glad that the Minister mentioned anonymity for women, which is most important because of the unique nature of rape and the media's obsession with it, nevertheless, should not the same consideration be given to men? Otherwise they are being treated very unfairly indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord in that, first, it is indeed a very complex matter; and, secondly, that I have much sympathy with some of the points made by him. However, I hope that he will agree that it is the balance that has to be struck between open justice and encouraging people to come forward who are complainants. Moreover, the Criminal Law Revision Committee, and others, have found it very difficult to conclude that there should be a separate and distinctive protection for sexual offences as opposed to all other crimes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, would it not be an absolute absurdity to accord anonymity to defendants in sexual cases but to withhold it from cases of murder, high treason, cruelty to animals, physical assaults on women not involving sex, physical assaults on children, attempted murder and much more serious offences? Is there absolutely any justification for that form of discrimination in logic?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend, in his inimitable style, has actually put the case for <P>


<a name="column_402"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>me. It is precisely because of the very points put by my noble and learned friend that the conclusion was reached that a distinction should not be made in this case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we all agree that this is a very complex situation and one for which there is no simple, right answer. However, I am puzzled by what the Minister said about victims coming forward. Will the Minister agree with me that the most important consideration in rape cases is that victims should be able to come forward without excessive suffering or discrimination against themselves? Why does the Minister think that anonymity&#151;which I am not necessarily supporting for the defendants&#151;should discourage victims from coming forward?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   No, my Lords; I am making the opposite point. I am saying that anonymity does in fact encourage them to come forward. But anonymity is afforded under the present system which we are supporting and which we are encouraging others to support. It is afforded to complainants in these cases; it is not afforded to the defendants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was referring to anonymity for the defendants. Why should anonymity for the defendants discourage complainants from coming forward? I ask that question not from any view of my own, but in order to ascertain the Minister's view.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   No, my Lords; I was not making that argument. In terms of arguing against anonymity for a defendant, I was simply querying why we should make a distinction for sexual cases and not for all the other crimes mentioned by my noble and learned friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister look at one simple aspect of the matter; namely, do we approve of the fact that people who are found innocent are not able to show that they are innocent and not shown by the powers of the press to be so? We hold that there is a great difference between being guilty and not guilty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, there is nothing clearer than a full acquittal. The system in this country means that, if someone is found innocent, then he is acquitted. That fact is very publicly made known to the press and, indeed, to all others.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister understand&#151;I am sure that she does&#151;and realise that in cases of rape, as has already been pointed out, the press takes a great interest in such matters and, indeed, very often condemns the accused before the court case takes place? Even when the person has been found innocent, people still say, "Well, there is no smoke without fire". Further, are not the accused then in danger, because they have been named, of being the victims of spite in certain circumstances?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am not going to defend the behaviour of the press, not only in cases of sexual crimes but also as regards other crimes. Indeed, many people are pilloried by the press to the point where, very often, the issue as to whether they get a fair trial is very <P>


<a name="column_403"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>much in doubt. Sometimes cases have had to be dismissed simply because of the way in which the press has behaved prior to a case being heard.
<P>

<a name="50622-01_para0"></a>I do not believe that that goes against my argument. It is very difficult&#151;and wiser people than I have sat in judgment on the matter&#151;to make a distinction between sexual offences and all other offences. If someone is accused of burglary, murder, violence, or whatever it might be, the same could apply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I appreciate her responses although I do not agree with them? Is the noble Baroness further aware that if the concept of anonymity for men is so absurd then Parliament was absurd when it passed a Bill in 1976 to give anonymity to men? Therefore, there is very little substance in the charge that it is an absurd proposition, unless one wants to condemn Parliament for being absurd. It was changed only recently, as the Minister knows.
<P>

<a name="50622-01_para1"></a>It is not the case that murder is highlighted in the press. Unfortunately, murder is not unique now. Rape is covered by the press and not murder. It was covered by the penny dreadfuls in the days when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, was a boy, but not any more. However, as I said, rape is covered by the tabloids very regularly. That is why men who are named in rape cases suffer despite being found not guilty in a court of law. That is why the Government should go back to the old ruling passed previously by Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the history given by the noble Lord is absolutely right. But, again, following anonymity being given to both the complainant and the defendant, the Criminal Law Revision Committee considered the matter most carefully and recommended that anonymity should not be given to the defendant. At that time, the Government accepted that view and, so far, they have not changed their mind about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, technical and production difficulties which can be overcome only at considerable expense rule out the provision of a window panel in the front cover of the passport to record the holder's name and title.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that rather disappointing reply. Does she agree that even if it is impossible to amend the passport because of the difficulty she has indicated, British people might be better disposed towards the European Union if they did not feel that it was removing from them one of their personal or national symbols of identity? Does she not also agree that the notion of subsidiarity could be <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>brought into play in protecting such symbols where that protection cannot conceivably be at odds with proper European co-operation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, we freely signed up to a common format and because of that we are bound by both the shape of the new document and what appears in the wording on the front. There is already a difficulty with the wording "European Community". I understand that steps will be taken to introduce the word "Union" for "Community". But having established a common format we are bound by the size and shape and what is contained within the document. Because of that there is no room to create a window on the front of the cover.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Tonypandy: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that although the passport is merely a symbol it is a symbol of our nationality and most British people did not understand that a signature had been given to prevent our being able to present a passport? What objection can there be to our having the choice of a British passport or the European one? Will that offend Europe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is important for me to stress that it is a British passport. We have adopted a common format but it remains a British passport and it remains available only to bona fide British citizens.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the whole concept of a supra-European state and a federal Europe is a dead duck and that all this business of tinkering about with the form, shape, colour and content of our passports is a hopeless irrelevance? Most people in the United Kingdom, including Members opposite, will be quite content with the authority, prestige, and honour of holding a British passport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to agree with the noble Lord and say that I hope a supra-national federal state is a dead duck, and long may that be the case. On the second point, I think perhaps there is some logic in having a common passport across Europe so long as the passport allocated within member states remains a passport for the nationals in that member state. That is the case with the particular passport we are discussing. It is a British passport available only to British subjects.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Hillhead: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that an even greater Labour British patriot than the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, Mr. Ernest Bevin, said that his object was to be able to go from Victoria Station without a passport of any sort to where the hell he pleased? Is that not more likely to be achieved by co-operation than by chauvinism?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, much has been done to allow freer movement of British nationals across the European continent but I have to make the caveat that we are also concerned about the security of our borders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, is not a principal advantage of the common format that while preserving the identity of the British passport it enables that passport to be read quickly by a machine anywhere in the Union and eventually in most parts of the world? Are not the <P>


<a name="column_405"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 405</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>advantages of that transparently honest once one has queued at a Greek or other frontier post with an old-fashioned passport?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend makes an important point. The passports we are discussing are machine-readable. That will help enormously not just as regards the example my noble friend gave but also in helping to speed things up at airports.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, further to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, is the Minister aware that some of us do not think that passports are the same since they were introduced by the words, "We, Ernest Bevin"? More seriously, the important information in a passport is contained inside the back cover. Why should not the back cover simply be reversed so that the information is outside and is available without the complicated opening procedure we have now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, that is a suggestion I have never heard. As always after responding to Questions in the House, I take good ideas back to my right honourable friends. I suspect that the reason given may still be technical and that the back of the passport has a type of cover which makes it difficult to expose the contents of the passport. I shall nevertheless report the information provided by the noble Lord to my right honourable friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, I am not used to this self-regulating Chamber. As the Minister is in the process of receiving positive ideas, will she look at the passport document from the point of view of its already multilingual nature and consider positively whether it is now time to include all official languages within the United Kingdom in the version of the passport now available?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I report any ideas wholly without prejudice to the outcome. I find it difficult to accept the suggestion of the noble Lord; nevertheless I shall make sure that my right honourable friend hears about it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, if titles cannot be put on the front of passports, what is the position with regard to knights, baronets and dames?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, there has been a concession to that end&#151;not on the front of the passport but on the page that contains the basic fundamental data&#151;that titles can be included in a shortened form and that somewhere else in the passport the full title can be printed for observational purposes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Hanson: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that there is little enough "feel-goodness" about the European Union as it is and that what has been proposed would be a positive concession to those of us who value, as the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, said, everything that is British from the Union Jack to the traditional blue passport? We enjoy demonstrating, when abroad, our pride in being British. We should consider this measure <P>


<a name="column_406"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and not just pass it over for reasons of machine reading or any other. It is possible for that to be done; it is not difficult. I ask my noble friend the Minister to consider the matter seriously on behalf of all of us here who seem to have strong feelings on the subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I understand the nostalgia for the blue passport; in fact, my own blue passport still has one more year to run. I understand the points being made, but we are party to an international agreement and we signed up to the common format. I believe that the noble Lord makes an impractical suggestion. Nevertheless I shall report his suggestion to my right honourable friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Whaddon: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness appreciate that while the information given on the inside back cover may be adequate for a computer reading, it is utterly useless for anyone such as a passport officer who wishes to address the holder with normal courtesy? To know that the holder is, "Mary Brown, female", is quite useless for that purpose. Can the matter not be considered further?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, there has been an agreement not to include prefixes. I note what the noble Lord says, but I understand that we have agreed that prefixes should not be included.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord King of Wartnaby: </B>   My Lords, may I make a comment about this? I find myself in complete agreement with the noble Viscount, Lord Tonypandy, as on so many other occasions. I have presented my passport to a number of immigration officers&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew21"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Question!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Viscount Cranborne): </B>  My Lords, I hope the noble Lord will realise that we are running out of time and there are two more Questions to go. Will he put a question to the House rather than a statement? As the noble Lord will be aware, that is our procedure.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord King of Wartnaby: </B>   My Lords, it is a pity because the statement was rather good. Can we get back to having a decent passport such as the blue one that I still have? That is very important. We trade in every country in the world. When the immigration officer sees it, he recognises it as being of some value and having some identity. This little red notebook is depressing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Blatch; </B>   My Lords, there can be no return to the old blue passport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Does he accept that the present mealy-mouthed and anodyne, to the point of misleading, bank references given nowadays mislead small businesses and lead them into serious debt? Bearing that in mind, will he consider whether the Government would be prepared to review the present system of credit references?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-02_spnew25"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that some bank references can be, as he puts it, mealy-mouthed but, of course, banks have a duty to their customers as well as to the inquirers. Banks are expected to make the meaning as clear as possible within certain confines. I remember an occasion when my father was asked to give a reference for someone who had been found stealing. He said that, although the doctor said that he should not lift heavy articles, he was quite good at lifting light articles. Sometimes a degree of interpretation is required. However, businesses which wish to obtain information about customers can also use credit reference agencies, to which my noble friend referred.

<A NAME="50622-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, if the small businessman finds bank references misleading, he can always obtain references from credit agencies or from other traders? He can deliver an initial first small order at normal commercial risk and then take a view. Does the Minister agree that that is probably of more value than a bank reference for which the bank accepts no liability?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I am bound to say that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, principally because that was the answer that I just gave to my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that since 1979 the many hundreds of thousands of small businesses that have been set up with the help of this Government have made a very good impression on our unemployment figures? Does he also agree that lower corporation tax on small businesses is a definite help, not only for small businesses but also for the economy, particularly in view of the easing of PAYE and VAT for small businesses? Does he agree further that, apart from bank references, it is high time that we looked at the rate of mandatory interest on late payers, particularly in relation to small businesses?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the general thrust of my noble friend's question which went considerably further than bank references. I believe he is trying to say that what has happened to and for small businesses since 1979 has been of great value to the country. It is perfectly true that small businesses have encouraged employers at a time when employment was decreasing in many other spheres.
<P>

<A NAME="50622-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monk Bretton: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that one may well receive a perfectly satisfactory bank reference on somebody who is an undischarged bankrupt? I have always thought that that is a fairly illogical situation. Can a bank take into account information from a third party when it gives a reference?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, as far as I know, banks can take into account what information they like in order to come to the facts which are included in the reference. I am not aware of the position with regard to undischarged bankrupts. But when a bank gives a reference, it gives a view of that person to the best of its ability without disclosing those matters which are best not disclosed. As the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said, it is for the individual to make inquiries also from other sources.

<FONT SIZE=3>I did not say that he had written. I said that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for National Heritage will be writing to Cabinet Ministers for their views on the short-list. Therefore, he was not quite accurate about that.
<P>

<a name="50622-03_para3"></a>The knowledge and opinions of other Ministers will help my two right honourable friends on the commission when they consider each project on the short-list. All commissioners are welcome to consult other parties. But at the end of the day, it is for the nine members of the commission to decide which projects to support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, do I understand from what the noble Baroness said that no letter has yet been written by the Secretary of State for National Heritage to Cabinet Ministers on this topic? Will she also assure the House that, if and when Cabinet Ministers are offered an opportunity to comment on the short-listed projects, a similar opportunity will be offered formally to the Opposition and to the relevant constituency Members of Parliament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, a letter was sent to Cabinet colleagues with regard to consultation on applications to the Millennium Fund and not in relation to the short-list. There will be another letter concerning the short-list, which has not yet been sent.
<P>

<a name="50622-03_para4"></a>The Opposition heritage spokesman has confirmed that Mr. Montague has discussed millennium matters with him, which is all that my right honourable friend has said. Mr. Montague is free to consult anybody he likes, as is any other member of the commission. My right honourable friend has not sent any information to Cabinet colleagues which is not already in the public domain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may follow up that briefly. Is the noble Baroness aware that Mr. Montague has certainly not written formally to the entire Shadow Cabinet seeking its views on individual applications and that he has never discussed an individual bid with the Shadow Secretary of State for Heritage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, first, Mr. Montague is not a member of the Shadow Cabinet. Secondly, he is at liberty to send any letter he likes. Let us not forget that this is only the second millennium. The first one occurred in the reign of Ethelred the Unready. The commission is doing its best to do better this time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, if there is an independent commission, why on earth cannot it make up its own mind without political guidance on priorities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, that is exactly what I have just said, and what it will do.

<A NAME="50622-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the House will be greatly reassured that the Members of the Cabinet correspond with one another in writing? That is most reassuring. Can we have <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Ezra </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 1, line 11, at end insert:
<br>
("( ) to protect the interests of consumers of gas conveyed through pipes in respect of the prices charged and the other terms of supply, the continuity of supply, the quality of the gas supply services provided and the exercise of rights under this Part to enter their premises;").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_411"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-03_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 1 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8. This amendment is of considerable importance because it relates to the duties under the Bill of the Secretary of State and the director.
<P>

<a name="50622-03_para15"></a>The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the protection of the interests of consumers of gas should be given priority. As the Bill is drafted, the protection of the consumers' interests is given second priority. That does not seem to be in keeping with what ought to be the objectives of the measure. When one reflects that in this country gas is the preferred user fuel for the vast majority of people who use it for domestic purposes, it is of considerable importance that any legislation aimed at changing the arrangements for the supply of that fuel should be seen to be conducted in the interests of the consumer. There can be no other justification for those changes.
<P>

<a name="50622-03_para16"></a>When the point was raised in another place, the Minister, Mr. Eggar, contended that the prior duties as stated in the Act were themselves supportive of the interests of the consumer and that therefore there was no need to put the interests of the consumer as a primary obligation. In fact he said that the secondary obligation was to look after the consumers; just because it is secondary does not mean that it is less important.
<P>

<a name="50622-03_para17"></a>I find that argument difficult to follow. If the Minister was saying that primary and secondary obligations rank equally, what is the point of making the distinction? I seriously commend to the Committee the contention that the protection of the consumer should rank as the overriding obligation and should figure at the top of the list indicated in Clause 1 of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   In speaking to this group of amendments, I shall concentrate on Amendment No. 1, but I shall also have a few words to say on Amendment No. 8. Amendment No. 6 is simply consequential upon Amendment No. 1.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para0"></a>We start from the proposition, with which I am sure the noble Earl will agree, as I hope do all Members of the Committee, that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para1"></a>That is a quotation, of course, from the greatest of all economists; it is from the Wealth of Nations. I am sure that the noble Earl will agree with that concept.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para2"></a>It looks as though the amendment is merely a drafting measure. Essentially it moves certain words from a few lines into the Bill to the beginning of the Bill. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said, it is not a matter of drafting. It is a matter of absolutely fundamental philosophy, both about how all economic activity should be judged&#151;that is why I cited to the Committee the quotation of Adam Smith&#151;and, overwhelmingly, as regards the Bill. The legislation was originally drafted in error by creating a private monopoly. As I pointed out at Second Reading, the purpose of the Bill is to rectify that error&#151;that had been accomplished by some earlier amendments to the law&#151;in order to introduce competition and alternative sources of supply. That is a subject to which I shall return on a later amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_412"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para3"></a>I also echo the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, in relation to the Minister's right honourable friend in another place. I felt that the Minister's right honourable friend simply misunderstood the points that were being made, and that in particular he did not understand the distinction between means and ends. That, too, is fundamental to the economic analysis of any industry. Essentially what one does&#151;correctly&#151;is to state the ends, in this case the interests of the consumer, and then state the means to achieve them. But the means are justifiable only in so far as they will achieve the ends that one has in mind. To start this Bill, as indeed the 1986 Act was started, with means, with describing methods and not ends, is again simply a logical error. These amendments seek to rectify those earlier mistakes.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para4"></a>A point that is also of interest, and one which I believe noble Lords on the other side will have found puzzling, is that after all the years of privatisation, as the Economist newspaper has pointed out on more than one occasion, the privatised industries are extraordinarily unpopular. People are puzzled as to why they are. We know why they are. It has nothing to do with meeting consumer demands; it has to do with certain other activities that they have been getting up to and which, for the moment at least, we shall not be debating. However, it is a pity, once industries are in the private sector, that they are portrayed as unpopular when, in the case of this Bill, the new private sector has the potential to do something that is very much in the interests of consumers. Therefore, I hope very much that when I sit down the noble Earl will leap to his feet and say, "Let's waste no more time on this particular amendment because naturally enough the Government will accept it". This amendment is extremely important. It is one that we cannot allow just to drift by.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para5"></a>Perhaps I might briefly say a word on Amendment No. 8. One problem with the overall drafting of the Bill&#151;and I have other amendments which endeavour to clarify it&#151;is that it raises a question as to what the draftsman has in mind. Again, the tradition of classical economics is the individualist tradition in which, after all, noble Lords opposite claim to be firm believers. The tradition is not particularly to do with groups. It is not to do merely with the consumer as we have defined him, but with the individual consumer. That is what matters.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para6"></a>Therefore, Amendment No. 8, which adds the words "to the individual", simply emphasises how important the individual is. In particular, it is to ensure that, should an individual consumer have grounds for complaint&#151;which, not surprisingly in a competitive enterprise economy, will happen&#151;the consumer can say, "You have failed to meet my individual interests". It is not a good enough argument for the industry to say, "Well, we've met the interests of consumers in general. You just happen to be the unlucky one". The reason for including "the individual" is very much to clarify what I assume Ministers had in mind when they asked the draftsman to draft the Bill. In other words, the lines on protecting the interests of consumers are essentially to emphasise, not just consumers in the large, but consumers viewed as individuals. I very much hope that the arguments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and myself commend themselves to the Committee; and I hope very <P>


<a name="column_413"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>much that the Minister will take the responsibility for agreeing with them and also for saying that we really must get this part of the Bill right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I am a simple man. I declared my interest in this Bill at Second Reading. I hope that that will suffice for Committee as well. As a simple man, I like to know from the very beginning, from the earliest possible point of a Bill, what that Bill is actually about. This amendment advances words which to all intents and purposes are already in the Bill, in subsection (2) (a) of the proposed new Section 4 to the 1986 Act. But there would be absolutely no purport to the Bill, no force in it whatsoever, unless we started at the very beginning. The very beginning, after all, is to secure that&#151;in so far as it is economical to meet them&#151;all reasonable demands (we can perhaps argue about the word "reasonable" in a moment) in Great Britain for gas conveyed through pipes are met. That is the whole rationale of the Bill. It was the rationale of the 1986 Act, and I should like to see the stipulation remain exactly where it is in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Perhaps I may interrupt for a moment as I believe it will help us with our procedures. I do not have any interests to declare, but, so far as I personally am concerned, a declaration of interest once throughout our proceedings will be enough. Otherwise they will become even more tedious. I accept that several noble Lords may have interests. Once they have mentioned them, that is good enough for me at least.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   Perhaps I may speak to Amendment No. 7, which adds a few words to the Bill. On these Benches we are concerned about the interests of the consumer. But we are also concerned that the interests of people who are potential consumers should also be looked after. We are anxious that the consumer should have sufficient information, in an easily comparable and comprehensible form, from the gas suppliers about prices and services. That should enable consumers to make an informed choice, and should therefore secure the most effective competition possible. We are concerned that we should cover the interests of consumers before they enter into contracts with the gas suppliers as well as after.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   I, too, declared an interest at Second Reading, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, for his indulgence. It seems to me that noble Lords opposite suspect that potential gas suppliers will behave like foot-in-the-door vacuum cleaner salesmen, or other unscrupulous salesmen, of which there seems to be plenty about. Perhaps they ought to give a measure of credit and accord some common sense to potential suppliers. I do not see that that is the case.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-04_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I do not think that there is very much between us on this matter. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said that he was concerned about the interests of consumers. Of course, we all are. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale mentioned his "simple mind". All that the noble Lord opposite is doing, as my noble friend correctly said, is advancing subsection (2) (a) higher in the Bill. <P>


<a name="column_414"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Therefore, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is concerned about the fact that consumers appear to be a secondary consideration, and he wishes to make them a primary consideration. I can understand his reason for wanting to do that.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, said that people do not like privatised industries. Perhaps they do not. But I remind the noble Lord that they did not like nationalised industries. This is the political point. The fact is, they are utilities; nobody likes them; people thought that they ought to be doing better by them, and so on. I hate to remind noble Lords opposite of one of the advantages of privatised industries, but the fact is that British Telecom's prices have gone down by 35 per cent. and British Gas prices have gone down by 20 per cent. That is of real interest and benefit to the consumer.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para8"></a>The real problem is that it is difficult to put the requirements of the consumer on the same basis as the requirement to supply gas in the first place. The priority for the regulator must be to create a framework in which it is possible for companies to compete, so that they can satisfy the demands for gas. The secondary duties relate to the manner in which that competitive framework operates. It would obviously not make sense if we were to place duties relating to the quality of service on the same level as securing that there are actually companies there to provide the service in the first place.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para9"></a>To give an example, the effect of this amendment could be to require the regulator so to enforce the cutting of prices that it would prejudice the ability of the regulated company to finance its activities. Of course, it would not be of much use to consumers if they were to get a price cut which resulted in the supplier being unable to provide the finance for his business. It would not make economic sense. Therefore, while I understand the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, it is right that first of all the main duty of the regulator should be to ensure that gas is supplied. Having ensured that, then the regulator can say that he or she has the interests of the consumer at heart.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred to Amendment No. 8, which would add to the existing duty in respect of the prices charged, and the other terms of the supply, the words "to the individual". It is an accepted drafting convention in Acts of Parliament that the singular includes the plural, and vice versa. I remember once pointing out that in Civil Service terms the male embraces the female. It occurred to me that we did not have to join the Civil Service to do that. But the principle applies: when the singular is used it covers the plural and vice versa. On some occasions, the interests of consumers will conflict and the director will need to balance those interests as a whole. At other times, individual consumers will have particular difficulties and interpretation as the singular will be apt. I do not feel that it is necessary to include the words which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has in mind, simply because they are covered.
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, referred to Amendment No. 7. I appreciate that he feels that the Bill ought in some ways to provide for the interests of those who would like to become gas consumers as well as those who already are consumers. That is why the Bill includes a duty on the Secretary of State and the director in relation to meeting reasonable demands for gas.
<P>


<a name="column_415"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-04_para12"></a>The Bill and the licences contain a number of other provisions which are designed to stimulate competition in building extensions to the pipeline network so that new areas can receive a gas supply. The duty to protect the interests of consumers is carefully framed in terms of matters which are specifically of interest to those who in fact consume the gas. It is difficult to see how the director, when he considers prices and other terms of supply, should take into account the interests of people who are not consumers of gas at the moment and might never be consumers. Obviously the principle of allowing freedom and competition is that more people will be brought in. But it is difficult to take account of what such people may be doing or what their interests may be until they become consumers. When they becomes consumers, those interests are taken into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down perhaps I could ask him a question. I fear that I am at risk of being considered a dithering wimp because at the outset of this debate I had the greatest sympathy with the amendment as it was moved, but as I listened to my noble friend's argument I understood precisely what he was trying to say.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para0"></a>I accept that if this competition is to be provided and it is in the interests of consumers&#151;just as privatisation, incidentally, has been in the interests of consumers&#151;why could not that, instead of pre-empting the duty, be put alongside the duty to ensure that competition existed as well as the supply?
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para1"></a>I realise that it would mean an amendment at another stage of the Bill. But would my noble friend consider that as a possible solution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My noble friend Lady Oppenheim-Barnes is too modest. She need not consider herself a wimp simply because she has been persuaded by what I said. It shows that she is very intelligent and entirely correct. I should like to go along with her thoughts in some respects. But the question to ask is this: what is the regulator doing? His first job is to ensure that there is gas available. I do not think one can equate that with saying that at the same time he has to consider the interests of the consumer. If there is no gas, there is no consumer. So the first duty must be that there shall be gas provided correctly and the immediate secondary interest is that the consumer shall be protected. I feel that it would be right to keep the Bill as it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I come back on that point. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, would also wish to do so. But, first, I should like to thank the Minister. I wanted him to go on record as confirming that the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular. That is very important. I was surprised that he did not go on to say that the present includes the future and the future includes the present and the amendment of my noble friend Lord Haskel would be covered in that way.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para2"></a>Let me give the Minister an example of why potential consumers are fundamental. In a few moments we shall have a debate on topics such as sustainable growth, energy policy and so on. What underlies our interest in those matters is precisely our interest in succeeding <P>


<a name="column_416"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>generations and potential consumers. So, logically and practically, there are very good grounds why potential consumers need to be taken into account. Those are my comments on the two rather minor amendments, if I may so call them.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para3"></a>It would never occur to me to use the word "wimp" in reference to the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes. She has told me off enough times for me to know that that is not her usual outlook. She said that she started by agreeing with me and then agreed with the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers; now she has what I believe is sometimes called a balanced view. My view is slightly less balanced. Indeed, the noble Earl said exactly what I hoped that he would not say. He made exactly the mistake that 200 years ago Adam Smith would have wished him not to have made; namely, that the product comes ahead of the consumer. That is just wrong. The consumer comes first. Satisfying consumer demand is what matters. The only value in the gas is if the consumer wants it. That is the whole point. The production comes later.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para4"></a>I was taken aback when the noble Earl insisted that he did not even want to think about that. It seems to me to be an actual error. The argument does not apply specifically to gas. It would apply if we were drafting a Bill about anything else. The whole point is: what does the consumer want? Does the system give the consumers what they want? Then we judge the system.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para5"></a>I do not resile at all from my remarks. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will not resile from his. It is an important distinction and I still hope to persuade the noble Earl to accept it. It would represent a very considerable contribution, as it were, to what the consumer wants; namely, the consumer receives what the consumer wants, and that is all that matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I do not wish to prolong this discussion for too long. I ask the noble Lord to read again what the clause says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State and the Director shall each have a duty to exercise the functions assigned to him by or under this Part in the manner which he considers is best calculated ... to secure",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para6"></a>first, that gas is conveyed through pipes; and then:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that licence holders are able to finance the carrying on of the activities".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para7"></a>Those are absolutely basic things. Then subsection (2) says that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subject to [the] above ... to protect the interests of consumers".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para8"></a>If the licence holders cannot finance their activities, there is no gas. The whole thing is done, in fact, with the consumer in mind. But there must be new Section 4(1) before one comes to new Section 4(2).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I listened with great care to all noble Lords, and particularly to what the noble Earl had to say. I am rather puzzled by his last argument. He implied that, as a result of this piece of legislation, an entirely new product in a new market is being created. He said that if there is no gas, there is no need to support the consumer.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para9"></a>Let me remind him that there are 18 million consumers presently receiving gas. They want to be assured that under the new arrangement they will continue to receive gas and that their interests will be seriously considered. I must say it is unthinkable that <P>


<a name="column_417"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Secretary of State and the regulator could do nothing to safeguard the consumer should they not be able to persuade the suppliers to supply gas or could not find any suppliers with the financial resources to carry out the business. Does the noble Earl indeed mean that the situation could arise in which, if not enough suppliers were found or their financial resources were inadequate, the whole supply of gas to the domestic market would be jeopardised? Of course he does not mean that. If he does not mean that, surely the interests of the consumers&#151;there are 18 million of them&#151;at least to continue to be supplied on the basis on which they are supplied at the moment should be safeguarded.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para10"></a>I hope that the noble Earl will think again. I repeat the words used by his right honourable friend; namely, the fact that just because it is secondary to safeguard the consumer does not mean that it is less important. The logical action is to promote it.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para11"></a>I feel that the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, opened up the possibility of a compromise. We on this side of the Committee have suggested that the protection of the consumer should come first. I personally would be content if the noble Earl were prepared to take back that suggestion, consider it and promote the protection of the consumer into the first category. That would be sufficient. Therefore, I ask him whether he is prepared to accept the proposition made by his noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is always deeply enticing when he suggests that we should think about the matter again. We have thought about this a great deal. He said that we did not seem to realise that there are 18 million consumers. Of course there are. That is what the whole of new Section 4(1) relates to. It is about securing that reasonable demands are met; that licence holders can finance their business so as to allow consumers to obtain gas; and about allowing effective competition. What is effective competition if it is not in the consumers' interests? That is its prime purpose.
<P>

<a name="50622-05_para12"></a>Immediately following on from that comes the part about looking after the consumer. The second part is dependent upon the existence of the first, but the first also concerns consumers. If I may say so, we are splitting hairs and the consumers are considered in both parts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Earl is not prepared to consider the matter again in the light of what his noble friend suggested. It is wrong to make the interests of consumers subject to the obligation under the first part. It qualifies that too much. I do not see why it should be difficult for the Government to introduce into the first part the protection of consumers. If the noble Earl is not prepared to think again, even in the light of the moderate proposal made by his noble friend, I feel that the opinion of the Committee should be tested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I do not want to be confrontational. I believe that the Government are right and the noble Lord believes they are wrong. I shall certainly consider what was said by the noble Lords, Lord Ezra and Lord <P>

<A NAME="50622-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My noble and learned friend is not being particularly helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   Let us have a Division.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am trying to be honest with the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, as I always am. I shall certainly consider what he and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, say. However, I believe we have got it right. I am prepared to consider what was said, but in saying that I do not hold out any great hope that I shall change my mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-05_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   In that situation I am glad that the noble Earl is prepared to ignore the pressures from his own Benches. If he is seriously prepared to reconsider the situation and come back with some suggestions, then I would not want to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I did not actually say that. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, asks if I will seriously reconsider and come back with alterations. I did not say that. What I said was that in courtesy to the noble Lords who have spoken I shall certainly consider what they said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am now lost. We have all sorts of codes in relation to gradations of listening to other arguments. This one sounded as though it was really no. Beyond the normal courtesies which we always exchange in your Lordships' Chamber, it sounded to me like no. It would help me in taking a view if the noble Earl would indicate whether he is saying no. If he is, we do not want to waste Report stage going over this again. If he is genuinely&#151;I do not say this with any disrespect&#151;intending to go over the arguments again and is capable of being persuaded, that is one thing. If what he is really saying is, "We are friends. I will look at it but I shall not be persuaded", then we may as well get it over and done with now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord seems to have got the taste of power in his mouth and I wish it were in his belly. I would not wish to deflect him. I was trying to be as reasonable as possible by saying that I believe we have got it right. If the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, considers that we have got it wrong, I am prepared to consider it but I do not hold out much hope of changing my mind. If the noble Lord, Lord Peston, wishes to get the matter over and done with, let us get it over with. Perhaps that will meet with the satisfaction of both noble Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Perhaps we ought to test the opinion of the Committee. With all the best intentions the noble Earl is not prepared to reconsider the matter seriously and therefore I suggest we decide by voting.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 1, line 13, leave out ("reasonable").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-06_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This, too, is an amendment to do with consumers. It is partly an attempt to try to understand what the Bill is up to. I thought that the easiest way to find out was to ask the noble Earl to explain why the word "reasonable" is included. My amendment essentially takes out the word "reasonable" so that the relevant paragraph would read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to secure that, so far as it is economical to meet them, all demands ... through pipes are met".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-06_para4"></a>I say to myself, and I said to myself when I first read the Bill, what does "reasonable" add, given that the word "economical" is there? The whole point of industry is that it is meant to be competitive, leading to outcomes which are economical and which can meet demand. What does "reasonable" add? What would be a demand that was economical but was unreasonable?
<P>

<a name="50622-06_para5"></a>My judgment is that this is just wrong. From my reading of the Bill, it is a mistake. But I am ever fearful of the lawyers and the parliamentary draftsmen and I therefore expect any minute to be told that it is part of the <P>


<a name="column_421"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 421</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tradition of English law that the word "reasonable" is always put before the word "demands", or something equally preposterous. Echoing the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and wearing my commonsensical hat, I simply ask the Minister to tell me why the word "reasonable" is there. Can he give me an example of a demand that is economical to meet but is not reasonable? That would solve the problem. I think it is impossible, but I would be interested to have an example.
<P>

<a name="50622-06_para6"></a>That is what the amendment is about. Essentially it underlines where I failed earlier&#151;the point that the consumer is paramount. The consumer expresses his or her paramountcy by making demands. Those demands should be met if they are economical to meet&#151;end of story. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50622-06_time2"></a><H5>4.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   It seems quite extraordinary to have put down this amendment because it appears to imply that there will be an obligation to meet unreasonable demands. Although a demand to meet unreasonable demands comes quite commonly from the Front Bench opposite, I hope that the Committee will not accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Perhaps I may clarify the point. The amendment precisely does not do that because the paragraph retains the word "economical". An economist would argue&#151;I hope that this does not turn the noble Lord against me&#151;if asked what was a reasonable demand, that it was one that was economical to meet. That is why the word "reasonable" is irrelevant. It should not be there. I do not think that there is anything between the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, and myself about unreasonable demands&#151;that is another subject which we may come to in due course. However, if he were to say to me, "What should happen?", I would say that all demands should be met as long as it is economical to meet them. That is the point.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   That is just the point I was seeking to make. A demand might be economical but it might be unreasonable. If Members of the Committee go to the point of taking out the word "reasonable", the implication is that we are prepared to accept the authorisation of unreasonable demands. I do not accept for a moment what the noble Lord says, that an unreasonable demand may not necessarily be economical.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   Let us get on with it!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My noble and learned friend Lord Hailsham is deeply anxious that we should get on. I shall do my best to satisfy my noble and learned friend and the rest of the Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, said that he wants to understand what the Bill is up to and that he is fearful of lawyers. He must not be too fearful. I am terrified of them, but I am terrified of economists, too, so that puts us on an equal footing.
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para0"></a>The words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"satisfy, so far as it is economical to meet them, all reasonable demands",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<a name="50622-07_para1"></a>have stood the test of time. That was one of the principal duties of the British Gas Corporation under the 1972 legislation; it was made a primary duty of the director in 1986; and we think that those words should be used now. They are sensible and they have stood the test of time. I agree with my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter that to go beyond that and remove the word "reasonable" implies that the director would have a duty to secure that unreasonable demands for gas would be satisfied.
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, asked for an example. I can tell him that there could be cases where practical considerations could mean that extending the gas supply to certain individual premises or groups of premises was not realistic even where it would be theoretically economical to do so. For example, one might have a large consumer who would offer a generous price for a greatly increased supply of gas on condition that the supply should be provided within a few days; or he might request amounts of gas that would be unsafe to convey through the existing pipework even though it might be economical for the gas company to do so; or convey gas which would otherwise have gone to another consumer, thereby diverting that gas from that consumer to the person requesting it.
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para3"></a>I do not think that there is anything sinister in this. The wording in the Bill reflects what was in the 1986 Act. I suggest that we ought to keep those words.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   The fact that something is of long standing does not mean that I am convinced that it is other than long-standing rubbish. The fact remains that if someone demands something and it is economical to meet it&#151;namely, that he is willing to pay the costs of meeting it, including a due return to the supplier&#151;that is what one means by a reasonable demand. There can be no other meaning to it. I simply do not understand the noble Earl's example. If someone wants to buy a lot of gas and is willing to pay for that lot of gas, why should that person not be supplied with that gas? If someone wants a lot of gas which might involve risk, essentially what one has to say is, "The risks arising here involve the following costs. Are you willing to meet all those costs?" The answer would, in practice, be no, and then it would be the "economical" test that would be met.
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para4"></a>What I am trying to do&#151;and it may be that I am being foolhardy&#151;is to scrutinise the Bill and clean it up. It never occurred to me that there is anything sinister here. It has nothing to do with trying to undermine the Bill. I am trying to remove the tendency, which I have experienced during all my years in your Lordships' House, of the draftsman to put in a lot of extra words and clauses for things which they see but which I cannot. It is my duty as an economist to say, "I know what industry is about and what competition means. It is supposed to be about meeting demand".
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para5"></a>Perhaps I may take a typical example. Marks and Spencer meet the demand of people who visit their shops and buy their stuff. It is not said at any time, "Are any of these demands unreasonable?". The stuff is there and you buy it; that is what industry is all about. What is there about this industry so that one adds the word "reasonable?"
<P>


<a name="column_423"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 423</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para6"></a>There is another factor which, curiously, even my noble friends forget. I am surprised to discover that noble Lords on the Government side also forget it&#151;that is to say, we are now dealing with a privatised industry and private enterprise. It is no longer a public utility we are dealing with, but a private business. There will be many such private businesses around. Why should legislation include words that would not be applied to any other private business? What is here that is so special?
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para7"></a>What is here&#151;I admit it from my side of the Chamber, but I did not expect to face it coming from the other side&#151;is that we are still not quite at one with what is happening in this industry. It is now going to be a competitive private industry. I know that some of my noble friends cannot face that. What staggers me is that noble Lords on the other side of the House cannot face it either. My view is that they still believe they are dealing with the old public corporation when they should not be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   I am not being purely frivolous when I say that if the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who has just spoken for the second or third time this afternoon, had taken as his model the draftsman of the first chapter of Genesis instead of Adam Smith, he might have got on a little better. The Lord said, "Let there be light". The first section of this Bill says, "Let there be gas". The second point is that the Lord,
<P>
<br>

<P>

<a name="50622-07_para8"></a>Genesis does not say that the Lord saw the light and that it was economical but "that it was good". That is exactly what the Bill says. If the noble Lord would only learn from Genesis instead of from Adam Smith he would get on better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   That is a very interesting intervention, as one might expect, from a very senior and experienced war-hardened practitioner in party politics. But the Lord did not say that the light was "reasonably good". Perhaps I may add one further point before we dispose of this important matter. In the course of his earlier comments the noble Earl introduced yet another word. It was not only economical; not only reasonable, but, "realistic". That is what he said. Is he suggesting that instead of taking out the word "reasonable" he would put in the word "realistic"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, is being even more unreasonable to suggest that I remove "reasonable" and put in "realistic".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   I said "add".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I shall not add it either because I would then get into trouble with the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and have to spend half the night explaining why I put it in. I return to the simple fact. I know that the noble Lord wants to be as economical as possible, but people know what these words mean because they have been used in the past. If one removes "reasonable" those who look at these things will say, "This director or Secretary of State does not have to meet reasonable demands; they can meet unreasonable ones if the only reason it is put in is that the demand should be economical." There may well be occasions when someone might say, "I am prepared to pay for a larger amount of gas and give tremendously <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>increased powers." But that would be to the detriment of other people and it would be unreasonable. Everyone knows what the words mean, including the noble Lord. We had better keep them there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I despair. I do not want to get into a discussion about Genesis. I believe that Adam Smith made a contribution to our understanding of the way in which economies work. However, for the life of me I cannot recall seeing that in Genesis or in the tablets of the law. That is by the way.
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para9"></a>It now seems to boil down to the fact that we all know what the word means except me. It has been there a long time and it will disturb people if it is taken away. Perhaps I may return to my example of Marks and Spencer. No one ever raises the point that if someone buys a particular item someone else may be unable to take it from the shelf. Markets are about buying things and meeting a price. All the arguments being put forward about gas seem to be part and parcel of a reluctance on the Government's side, which surprises me, to accept what they themselves are doing, which is producing a competitive private sector.
<P>

<a name="50622-07_para10"></a>I am not going to press the point because there are other matters on which I wish to divide the Committee. I believe that the Government's side have not understood what is being done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-07_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Perhaps I may help the noble Lord. If I had the pleasure of a house next to the noble Lord and he was being supplied, not with gas but with water and we were paying the same amount, let us suppose we had a very hot summer and his garden had dried up. He goes to the water authority and says, "I shall pay you twice as much because I want to water my garden, but poor old Ferrers next door can go without water". That would be unreasonable and the noble Lord would be far better off not being allowed to do that.

<A NAME="50622-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl. He has described free enterprise capitalism and how, according to Adam Smith, it is supposed to work. If the water is worth more to me than it is to my very good friend Lord Ferrers, I should have it according to free market theories. It is not for me to teach noble Lords opposite the theory of the free market. However, I would not do that because there are other things in life such as behaving decently. But one does not write that kind of thing into Acts of Parliament. One assumes that the world we live in includes decent behaviour and therefore that will not happen.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para0"></a>I am aware that I have managed to make my points but I have not persuaded the noble Earl. I am still tempted to divide the Committee and so have noble Lords opposite voting for a load of nonsense, but we want to get a move on. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para3"></a>I am very interested in what "effective competition" means. I have looked through all the economic text books on my shelves at home and at college. The words "competition", "pure competition", "perfect competition" and "imperfect competition" appear, but I cannot find "effective competition". My main question is this: what do the Government have in mind here? How will they tell what this is about?
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para4"></a>This is all preliminary to the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, which are the important ones. What really matters is not effective competition, but effective choice, as we shall discuss later. The noble Baroness puts her finger on what is the central issue here.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para5"></a>If it will help the noble Earl, my judgment is that "competition" means that there should be alternative sources of supply; that each should be acting independently of the other; that there should be no collusion; and that the demander should have the ability to discriminate between suppliers. There should also be available full information as regards price, quality and all other related matters. That is what "competition" means&#151;at least, that is what it means in first-year economics lectures.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para6"></a>I now have to ask whether the noble Earl will tell me what the word "effective" adds. I cannot think of anything that it adds, so I do not want the word in the Bill. I have tabled other amendments for a similar reason. I should like the Bill to read as if it was written by someone who understood what they were talking about. In my judgment, that means that the word "effective" has no effect. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50622-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I cannot add very much to what my noble friend Lord Peston said. It seems to me that either you have competition or you do not. The word "effective" could imply that suppliers might have an opportunity to sidestep some of their obligations. I am sure that we shall be given assurances that there is nothing sinister in this, but if you need to have effective choice for all classes of customer, there should be no discrimination between large and small, rich and poor, awkward or amenable. The use of the word "effective" seems to give gas suppliers an opportunity to sidestep their obligations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-08_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Peston, is being a nitpicker, is he not? He does not like several individual words. I think that "effective" does mean something here. The word is intended to require the director and the Secretary of State to work to ensure not only that competition is established but that it actually works. The whole point of competition is to provide incentives for the providers of a product or service which will result in improvements in their standards for the benefit of consumers. It is also intended to introduce new ideas to meet consumers' needs. That produces a powerful downward pressure on prices. It would not be "effective" competition if the competition was merely nominal. There needs to be a genuine contest for consumers' business so that competition pushes down prices and succeeds in increasing quality.

<a name="50622-08_para7"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, finds the concept of "effectiveness" difficult. If he were to be put in the ring with Mike Tyson, that would be competition, but perhaps I may suggest that it would not be effective competition because the noble Lord would be out on his knees in a minute. What we want to see is proper competition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the noble Earl. If I got in the ring with Mike Tyson, he would, of course, win because he is better than I am. That is what one means by competition. Competition is about different people competing&#151;in the case of gas, for a market. The noble Earl is right to emphasise that companies compete in terms of price, quality and new ideas. That is what competition is. I insist that the word "effective" adds nothing. We shall come to what "effective" adds when we discuss the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, which relates to choice.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para8"></a>It seems to me that in relation to competition the role of the Secretary of State and of the director should be to ensure that there is competition. I agree that it should be genuine competition in the sense that there should be no collusion. We should not have something else which Adam Smith worried about; that is, implicit collusion between people who were allegedly competing with each other.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para9"></a>This is another example of something that one sees throughout legislation. I refer to draftsmen having no courage when it comes to the English language. They are frightened of using the straightforward word "competition" and think, "We have to add a word to it. It will not work if we just use the language of ordinary people". They should try to be like Adam Smith or those who translated the Authorised Version. They should use straightforward language. Draftsmen want to add little words, and I do not like it. I would be much happier if people used the language as we know it. But having said that&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-08_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I do not want to prolong this debate, except to say that I have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble Lord says. I do not like nasty words which do not mean anything, but I believe that the word "effective" means something in this connection. We have to provide competition which works. The noble Lord said that he thought that it would be a very good idea if he was put in the ring with Mike Tyson because that would be competition. Actually, he did not quite say that; that is my flowery interpretation. The fact is that people pay a lot to see Mike Tyson because of the big competition. With respect to the noble Lord, they would not pay very much to see him fight it out with Mike Tyson because he would be flat on his back within 10 seconds. That is not good competition. We want to ensure that the competition is effective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   People might come to see me because they like a good laugh. Anyway, I might talk Mike Tyson out of it. That is another possibility, but I am not having much success in talking the noble Earl out of anything. We shall have to agree to disagree on this matter. Our remarks are on the record and that is what matters. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-08_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 1, line 21, at end insert ("and to secure effective choice for all classes of consumers supplied with gas by those required to be licensed under section 7A(1) below.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-08_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 4, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 5, 9 and 10. The Gas Consumers Council asked me to table these amendments because it is concerned about the lessening of statutory consumer protection within an otherwise well structured Bill. Any one of the amendments which I have tabled to Clause 1 would, if accepted, do much to restore the balance between the interests of suppliers and consumers. At this point, I must draw my noble friend's attention to the fact that I have tabled four amendments. That gives him such a wide choice that it must be difficult to rule out all of them. Each of the amendments is slightly different, but each would impact on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para12"></a>My intention is to extend choice. There are many ways to achieve that objective. On Second Reading I drew attention to the new duties in Clause 1. They require the Secretary of State and the director to "secure effective competition". Perhaps my noble friend will shed some light on his interpretation of that duty. My interpretation is that the Secretary of State and the director must encourage as many new suppliers as possible to enter the market. That is a right and proper duty, but I do not believe that it will necessarily afford choice to all domestic gas consumers.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para13"></a>The objective of my amendments is to redress the imbalance by introducing a new duty in Clause 1 to secure, or alternatively to promote, effective choice for all gas consumers. The success of this legislation for each of the 18 million gas-consuming households will not be judged by the number of suppliers licensed by Ofgas. In reality, consumers will not care whether there are five, 10 or 100 suppliers. Each household will judge the success of the legislation only by whether they have a realistic alternative. British Gas will be the one supplier which is already known to everyone. Will others offer low gas prices and/or equivalent or better standards of service? I look forward to the time when all domestic gas consumers are able to debate with confidence the pros and cons of one supplier in relation to another.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para14"></a>In her 1994 annual report the director general of Ofgas said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"By 1998 all gas consumers will be able to choose where to buy their gas".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para15"></a>How can she realistically believe that choice will develop to the extent that all gas consumers will have choice available to them by 1998?
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para16"></a>My belief would appear to be backed by the Government's standard conditions for the supply licence. Condition 13 gives freedom to all but the dominant supplier to discriminate between classes of consumer. I expect ample competition between many gas suppliers. I think that we shall have the effective competition to which my noble friend referred on the last amendment. However, choice&#151;I emphasise the word "choice"&#151;will <P>


<a name="column_428"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exist for only a relatively limited number of gas consumers. In that likely event, what action can we expect the director to take if she has a duty only with regard to competition, not choice? I believe that any one of my amendments would resolve that situation.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para17"></a>The new duty would require the director to encourage suppliers, by all means possible, to enter those areas of the country where choice is sparse or non-existent. It would require the director to encourage suppliers to generate choice for all consumers within their licensed area. The director has a duty under Clause 6 not to grant a licence or extension of a licence which has been framed so as to exclude pensioners, the disabled or those likely to default on paying for their gas supply. That is only the first step to prevent cherry picking and to ensure that the competitive market provides universal choice. It is on the negative side. No sensible supplier will go to the director and say that he wants to supply Westminster, Chelsea and Mayfair but not Camden or Lambeth. The duty contained in Clause 6 prevents him from doing so.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para18"></a>However, once the supplier has received a licence for his area, which may include Camden, Lambeth or whichever other areas he may not wish to supply, there is nothing to prevent him from not supplying customers whom he perceives to be difficult or expensive to serve. He will be able to do that quite easily by not targeting, informing or selling to such customers.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para19"></a>An amendment to promote or secure choice will mean that the director will have to monitor the development of a competitive gas market to establish what choice is available to consumers. I see this taking the form of a requirement on gas suppliers to provide to the director information on the customer mix in their supply portfolios. They may be required to provide the director with the proportion of their customers who are of pensionable age, who are disabled, who are in receipt of state benefit or who are taking supplies by prepayment meters. One of the recommendations of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry was that the DTI and Ofgas should set out how the distribution of the less profitable categories of customer should be monitored. That is one means by which this could be achieved.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para20"></a>I am sure that my noble friend will argue that all suppliers will have an obligation under licence condition 2 of the standard conditions to make available a supply of gas to every potential customer who applies for a supply. This assumes that every consumer is aware that a competitive gas market exists. My amendment would charge the director with the duty to promote choice and to make sure, through the licences and otherwise, that consumers are aware that choice is available, which companies supply their areas and what they have to do to change supplier.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para21"></a>The Gas Bill allows for a levy or, as condition 6A of the standard conditions of the gas supplier's licence calls it, a special customer payment. My noble friend Lord Caithness has tabled an amendment which is concerned with the issue of a levy. The levy may be raised if a supplier has been supplying gas or ancillary services to an undue proportion of premises owned or occupied by those who are disabled, of pensionable age or have defaulted or <P>


<a name="column_429"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fallen into arrears in the payment of charges for gas that they have consumed. In effect, it is an acknowledgment of potential market failure.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para22"></a>I believe that my amendment to promote choice will allow the director to define in a wider sense what is meant by special customer payment. Clear definition will encourage gas suppliers to supply less attractive consumers, because they will be more confident that they will receive payment from the levy for costs that they may incur but cannot otherwise recoup.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para23"></a>Each of my four amendments would give the director a duty with regard to choice. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 create a primary duty, and Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 a secondary duty, to secure or promote effective choice.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para24"></a>I should like to end with a simple statement. The Gas Bill should be about bringing choice to consumers. The director general should have a clear and unequivocal duty to do so. I believe that so far the Bill has favoured the gas supply industry over the consumer. My amendments to promote competition and choice, either as a primary or secondary duty&#151;I am happy for it to be either&#151;will redress the balance. I beg to move.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment so ably moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes. I believe that to champion the cause of the consumer, as I have done at an earlier stage in this debate and now&#151;and will continue to do&#151;reveals a degree of objectivity on my part. I declared on Second Reading that I was chairman of a gas distribution company. Even so, I happen to believe that the interests of all in a market are best served by having satisfied and well safeguarded consumers.
<P>

<a name="50622-08_para25"></a>Choice is a matter of great importance. We should not delude ourselves that the creation of effective competition will itself create choice. As the noble Baroness has pointed out, there may be areas where there is no effective choice. Those may be distant areas or areas in which, for other reasons, the new supplying companies have no interest and in which there may possibly be no choice. I believe that in those circumstances it is not unreasonable, given that this will remain a regulated business, that the director should comprehend within her duties the obligation to make sure that there is effective choice where there may not be such choice. That can be done by talking to the appropriate suppliers and pointing out to them that under the terms of their licences they are expected to provide choice, which they may not otherwise do. The steps by which that may be done have been described by the noble Baroness, and I need not go through them again. I very much hope that the noble Earl will regard this amendment as a constructive one. He is provided with a choice as to the preferred form of words, but if he agrees with any one of these amendments, he will be rendering consumers a considerable service under the new regime.

<A NAME="50622-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I live in the south west of England. It may surprise noble Lords to know that even before the ink is dry on this Bill I have received offers to supply me with gas. Regretfully, they have gone straight into the wastepaper basket because I am not connected to <P>


<a name="column_430"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>gas, and I cannot see any immediate likelihood of being so connected. Nonetheless, the opportunity of choice has already been presented to me. I have no doubt that it will continue to be presented not only to me but to others, first in the trial areas and then more widely when the whole country is opened up to competition in 1998.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para0"></a>As far as the individual amendments are concerned, I am slightly worried by the idea of asking either the Secretary of State or the director of Ofgas to promote effective choice. One can promote until the cows come home, but one may not necessarily get a result. I have been trying to promote myself into well-paying jobs for the past four or five years since I left the position beside my noble friend Earl Ferrers. I have failed, but not for lack of trying. If there is any benefit in this set of amendments, I am sure that what is needed is a duty to secure choice rather than promote it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-09_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, wishes me to speak first. It is very odd that we all wish to speak on this simple matter. My noble friend has moved a series of amendments. I have a great deal of sympathy with what she intends. She wishes to provide all consumers with choice. That is exactly what lies behind the whole purpose of the Bill. The intention of the Government's proposals is to introduce competition in the gas market.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para1"></a>What the amendments say is covered by the Bill's existing provisions. Under Clause 1, the director will have a duty to secure effective competition between suppliers. That will be a primary duty which will guide her in the exercise of her functions. It seems to me that if a case should ever arise where there was an area or a class of customer for whom suppliers were not competing effectively, it would be the director's duty to seek to exercise her functions in such a way as to resolve the lack of competition.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para2"></a>It is not practicable to go further. Although the director is required to seek to create the most favourable circumstances for competition, she cannot make people compete, as my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale said. It is like saying that you can take a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para3"></a>To cast the duty in terms of promoting rather than securing choice would of course help deal with the question of whether the duty went too far, but it would leave very little that is not already provided for. Once the director has secured effective competition in respect of a class of consumers, it is difficult to see what more she could do to promote choice for them. The provisions in the Bill cover the point that my noble friend Lady Gardner is trying to make. I thought we had had this, but she referred to that horrible expression "cherry picking". I would respond to her only in this way, that we believe a competitive market is the best method of ensuring consumer choice.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para4"></a>To begin with suppliers will be keen to establish their market share, and that will provide a strong incentive for them to take on customers rather than to turn them away. That will militate against a selective approach to attracting customers. I do not believe that there should be a legislative obligation on all suppliers to develop an <P>


<a name="column_431"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 431</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>identical portfolio of consumers. It would be absurd to set supply companies any form of quota for a certain number of different customers.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para5"></a>We intend to discourage suppliers from "cherry picking". The director general will have a duty to refuse applicants for licences which artificially exclude an undue proportion of pensioners and the disabled or those likely to default on payments. That is found in Clause 6 on page 8. That is an important provision which will ensure that licence areas do not, for example, exclude areas or estates within a town or city which might be considered to contain an undue proportion of such customers.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para6"></a>All suppliers will have an obligation to supply to all customers in their licence area, irrespective of the customer's income, how much gas they use, or whether they are elderly or disabled. Suppliers will also be obliged to process all applications for supply without undue preference and offer a range of payment methods, including cash, cheque or postal order, so that customers who wish or are able to pay only by those methods can, in practice, go to any supplier.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para7"></a>While I understand what my noble friend is saying, it is difficult to expect the director general to promote competition in that way. Her job is to ensure that competition exists. The results will promote themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am sorry to say that the Minister has somewhat lost me on this. The Bill as drafted uses the word "secure" in line 19. It states, "to secure effective competition". So there can be no worry about the word "secure". The Bill uses the word "secure". When I was complaining and moaning to the Minister about what that meant, he told me that it meant essentially what the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, said: it will secure choice. That is the point of it. Now when she asks why we do not write into the Bill "to secure choice", the Minister seems to argue that that cannot be done because the director general cannot do that. I feel that there is a contradiction here.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para8"></a>The point of the Bill is precisely what the noble Baroness says. I say it is the essence of the Bill. It is not all that was involved. I would fully accept that the regulated monopoly that constitutes British Gas led to a fall in the real price of gas&#151;a point that the Minister has made several times; in other words, a regulated monopoly did lead to an outcome, but it was not an outcome that allowed choice to the ordinary household.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para9"></a>The Bill now introduces competition. Why does it do it? It presumably does it because the Government believe that this structural outcome will be better than a regulated monopoly; otherwise we would leave well alone. We are not going through all this just to occupy the Committee's time; we are doing it because we now believe that the structure of the industry, subject to competition, will be better. What do we mean by "better"? We mean offering choice to consumers, exactly as the noble Baroness says. What are our means? Our means of getting there is competition.
<P>

<a name="50622-09_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and I wanted the matter set out in that order, with the means coming after the end, but we have lost that battle, at least for this afternoon. Therefore I am at a loss as to why the Minister&#151;other <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>than that he is obviously in no mood to accept any amendment or even to go away and think again&#151;will not say not merely that he welcomes the amendment but that it is his duty to accept it because it is the point of the Bill. That is what I would press him on. Why would he not want to include it, given the arguments that he has put to us this afternoon? May I at least ask him to think again?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   Will the noble Lord explain why, having spent a good deal of time on the previous amendment to try to take out the word "effective" before the word "competition", he supports an amendment which inserts the adjective "effective" in front of "choice"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   That is easily done. That in fact is to cede the argument to me. The point is to have competition. If you ask me why I want competition, it is to produce effective choice. It is not effective competition that interests me; it is effective choice. I said that at the time, I might add. I want competition&#151;meaning firms competing with one another. But if you ask me whether I want it for its own sake, the answer is no. I want it because it leads to consumer choice. I regard that as absolutely fundamental to the working of the kind of economic system in which we live. I do not use the word "fundamental" lightly. I have spent my life lecturing on this stuff. I regard competition&#151;I can find some counter examples where it will not work&#151;broadly speaking, as of the essence. And the reason it is of the essence is that it meets consumer demands. Why does it meet consumer demands? Because it offers them choice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   The noble Lord cannot get away with that. If there is not effective competition, there will not be effective choice. What is apparent is that he is prepared to swallow the word "effective" in an amendment against the Government, but not to accept the word "effective" in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-09_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, answered the very problem that he put. He said that competition leads to consumer choice. That is so. We agree with him over that. The very first clause says that the purpose is "to secure effective competition". What you cannot do is to secure choice. You cannot "promote choice" which are the words in my noble friend's amendment. What you can do is to secure competition, and competition will lead to choice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-09_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I have listened with great interest to what has been said. I do not accept the arguments that my noble friend came back with. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale said that he had already been offered gas supplies. That is interesting, because it must mean that he is a cherry, and that his area is one that may attract people in the future, even though he does not have a supply now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   As I said earlier, the firms in question clearly had not done their homework. I cannot be described as a cherry if I am not connected to the public gas main.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I live in a village which did not have gas but does now. We went through great trauma to get it. We had to prove how many people there <P>


<a name="column_433"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 433</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were. I went through the survey to see how many people in the village had to have it to make it economical to connect it. It has made a tremendous difference to our village life. It is a great advantage. I am grateful to British Gas for doing that.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para0"></a>My noble friend says that the whole purpose of the Bill is to provide choice, but then, as we read it, we find that it is not; it is to provide competition, which he says will lead to choice. But there is no guarantee that it will lead to choice. I would emphasise again that there is a vast difference between "effective"&#151;to use the word that my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter used&#151;competition and effective choice. Surely competition is effective if my business is making more money than your business. I will achieve that by using my gas supply to the greatest profit for my company and not for the people to whom I am supplying the gas. They are an important part of my business and of course I am out to get whatever customers come along who will be profitable for me. However, if it is likely that they will present me with a great loss I shall not go out looking for them.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para1"></a>My noble friend said that we do not want every firm to have an identical group of consumers. No, we do not, and the levy for those who are carrying consumers to their disadvantage will help to offset the problem. The Bill provides for a disadvantaged firm to be helped, and my amendment will clarify that.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para2"></a>The noble Lord said that every successful firm will process applications for supply. That brings me to my point. One cannot apply for a supply if one does not know that it exists. Everyone knows that British Gas exists. Whether or not one has gas in one's village, everyone knows that British Gas exists and supplies gas. It is a household name and has been for as long as I can remember. However, if one does not know that there is an alternative supplier one does not know that one has a choice. That is why the director should have the responsibility of promoting the awareness of choice.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para3"></a>My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale said that you could promote until the cows come home but without result. That is right but if people are not provided with information how will they discover that a choice exists? There must be a process for that and the person with the responsibility should be the director of Ofgas. It is important to differentiate between competition and choice. I hope that my noble friend will read carefully in Hansard what I have said. I believe that later amendments will bring home more clearly the importance of the availability of choice and the fact that that should be written into the Bill. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para7"></a>The amendment is tabled in order to inquire why the word "promote" is used in paragraph (b) "to promote efficiency" and why the word "secure" is used in paragraph (c) "to secure effective competition". I believe that the word "promote" should be removed and that the word "secure" should be inserted because it is a much stronger word for the reasons which the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, explained so eloquently. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I cannot resist saying that it is for my noble friend Lord Ferrers to defend the wording of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   If the word "secure" is put before the word "efficiency" what will be done if efficiency is not secure? That is the dilemma. Efficiency is capable of being promoted but it is incapable of being secured.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   The noble Lord has put his finger on the drafting problem. If the word "secure" is inserted and that does not happen, what will follow? On the other hand, if the word "promote" is used one is under no obligation for anything to happen, which is what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, argued. So why are we wasting our time? We want a wording which leads to something happening or we may as well leave the whole thing out. I have sat through many Bills in this Chamber when we have put in all kinds of vague words which make everyone happy but nothing very much follows. I agree that that is the problem.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para8"></a>What we really want is the efficient use of energy. We have a director general, and we would like him or her to do something to achieve that. If we use the word "secure" we run into the logical problem of what will happen if that does not come about. I suppose that the answer is that the person gets fired or has 10 per cent. taken off his salary. I suppose that we could have performance-related pay. If we use the word "promote" all that will happen is that when we ask what is going on the director general will say, "I recently published pamphlets on promoting energy efficiency", and one thinks, "So what?". That is the problem. We have tabled the amendment in order that we can air it.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para9"></a>The noble Earl earlier mentioned Mike Tyson. Perhaps I may tell him that he has ground me into the dust and, therefore, as regards my Amendment No. 12, which removes the words "and economy" because "efficiency" already covers the point, I am getting fed up with saying, "Let's clean up the Bill and convert it into ordinary English". If I were not ground down I would say that that was the point of Amendment No. 12. The words "and economy" add nothing because "efficiency" covers "and economy". I have accepted defeat and realise that today I shall win no battles on the correct use of language.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   As someone totally committed to securing energy efficiency, I wish to ask the Minister what is the significance of using different words in paragraphs (b) and (c)? Is securing competition more important in the Government's mind than promoting efficiency and economy? If the two objectives rank similarly why not use the same word in both cases?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   It grieves me to think that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has been ground into the dust but it <P>


<a name="column_435"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 435</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does not seem to have stopped him talking. Neither the director general nor the Secretary of State are in a position to secure the efficiency of a commercial organisation. One cannot do that. They can act in a way such as will promote efficiency but they cannot secure it. Perhaps they can do that by setting a challenging price control but achieving efficiency is a matter for the board of the company concerned. One can secure only what is in one's control; one cannot secure that which is outside it. However, one can promote it.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para10"></a>The Bill is similar to the 1986 Act and uses the word "promote". It provides the basis for a system of regulation which gives companies an incentive to be more efficient. It also requires the director general taking regulatory decisions to take account of those decisions on the company's efficiency. But the director general cannot secure that customers are efficient. She cannot send her staff to turn down people's thermostats and to close their windows. However, she can promote energy efficiency and that is why the new draft supply licence contains provisions designed to promote energy-efficient packages.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para11"></a>As regards "and economy", perhaps I may point out to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that one cannot be efficient without being economical but one can be economical without being efficient. That is the reason why we believe that it is best to leave the words as they stand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   The way in which we measure the effectiveness of the director general is to see how effective he or she is in securing efficiency. I realise that one cannot be sure that the director general will or will not secure it but certainly one can measure how effective he or she is in doing that. However, I do not wish to prolong the discussion and therefore I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(i)").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-10_para14"></a>The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 14 is one of those parliamentary absurdities: it is apparently devoid of sense, but it is in fact pregnant with implications. It is linked with a set of amendments all of which I should like to speak to; that is to say, Amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 18. It is also linked with Amendment No. 20 which is tabled in the name of my noble friend on the Front Bench and also with Amendment No. 22. I shall want to return to one or two of those amendments because I believe that what I say could become too convoluted and complicated if I try to deal with all of them at once as they pick up different threads.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para15"></a>The way in which energy is produced and supplied&#151;and, in the case of gas, the way in which it is used&#151;can have major impacts on the environment. The Bill seems to seek parity between electricity and gas as there are many similarities in the wording. However, there is a fundamental difference. The burning of fuel by electricity generators is subject to environmental regulation and there is a mechanism to raise the related costs. But, with gas, it is the end user, the consumer, who burns it. So we have to consider that there is also an appropriate place for <P>


<a name="column_436"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 436</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>environmental regulation and associated costs on its end use. That is one of the points that I make in Amendment No. 17.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para16"></a>As regards Amendment No. 15, I am glad to see that I am at one with my noble friend in that we leave out the word "physical". I am informed that the term has no actual definition in law and that we would be much better off without it.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para17"></a>Amendment No. 17 deals with two points. First, it deals with the fact that we need to consider the environmental impacts of the use of gas by the consumer which I mentioned just now. Gas is a hydrocarbon and, being burnt, it produces water and carbon dioxide. As Members of the Committee will know, the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is of major international environmental concern.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para18"></a>Amendment No. 17 also introduces&#151;because of the way that the words fall&#151;the duty on the regulator and on the Minister to have in mind,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the objective of achieving sustainable development".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para19"></a>We have had some complicated debates on sustainable development in the Environment Bill. But I believe that the concept, although it may be difficult to define, is broadly understood, widely supported in the country and supported by all political parties.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para20"></a>The basis of sustainable development is to reconcile the dual objective of achieving economic development and, at the same time, providing for effective protection and enhancement of the environment. There is no paramountcy of interests in sustainable development, but there must be real and equivalent consideration of all interests, especially the environment. I believe that this fact was fully recognised in the recent Energy Report, particularly in Chapter 5 which is titled, "Energy and the Environment". Therefore, I believe that the concept needs to be brought into the Bill. I also believe that it is entirely consistent with the Government's intention in seeking the goal of sustainable development to ensure that it is there.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para21"></a>My attention in that respect has very sharply been focused by the role that I personally have been invited to play in the programme related to the Government's sustainable development goals; that is to say, in the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development. Those things have all happened rather recently, which is why I did not have the opportunity to raise them on Second Reading and why I apologise for introducing such topics now without having, as it were, waved my flag at a previous stage.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para22"></a>As part of my participation in the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development, I was invited to chair a working group on energy policy. In order to shorten what I need to say, I have obtained the permission of the two co-chairmen of the Round Table on Sustainable Development&#151;namely, the Secretary of State for the Environment and Professor Sir Richard Southwood&#151;to place in the Library the report of the energy policy working group which I chaired. I believe it has also been circulated to a number of noble Lords. Very briefly, its conclusions (and such conclusions were reinforced by the consensus of the whole Round Table which met on 15th June) were that market forces and sustainability were not mutually reinforcing because they were not intentionally <P>


<a name="column_437"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 437</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aligned. I hope that this phraseology will appeal to the economist on the Benches opposite, because it seems to me to be a very sensible statement.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para23"></a>In essence, what the Round Table concluded was that an unfettered energy market would not necessarily produce sustainable results because it would not take into account the full range of externalised, environmental costs. Therefore, in the long term&#151;and I believe that this is entirely consistent with everything that I read in the Energy Report&#151;mechanisms will be needed to establish the environmental boundaries within which a free market can operate. The aim of my series of amendments is to do just that.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para24"></a>I should like to point out that there is a very subtle difference between Amendment No. 22, which is tabled in my name, and my noble friend's amendment, Amendment No. 20. With my noble friend's permission, I should like to return later to Amendment No. 20 in particular. However, I hope that I have made clear the intentions of my amendments. It is of fundamental importance because I believe that the issue was overlooked first of all in the original Gas Bill of 1986. Indeed, we must remember that events have moved on very markedly since that time. Many of the ideas that we now have on environmental protection and sustainable development simply had not properly evolved, or did not exist in 1986.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para25"></a>The way that the Bill is constructed means that we are amending a 1986 Bill. However, as we are in 1995, I believe that we ought to do so with the determination and the understanding of environmental issues which now exist almost a decade later. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I should like to support the remarks just made by the noble Earl and especially what he said in relation to Amendment No. 17. I am glad to note from Amendment No. 15 that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, is likely to agree that the qualification of environment by the word "physical" will be removed. That was a puzzle to everyone who read the Bill as to precisely what was meant by "physical environment"; indeed, what happened to the rest of the environment? However, I take it that that puzzle has now been removed.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para26"></a>I believe that the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, was absolutely right in the two points that he made as regards Amendment No. 17. The first point is that, as now drafted, there is a duty to take into account the effect on the environment&#151;that is, if one leaves out the word "physical"&#151;of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"activities connected with the conveyance of gas through pipes".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para27"></a>However, I am puzzled as to why that should be limited to the conveyance of gas. Obviously the use of gas is as important, if not more important, than its conveyance. Generally speaking, the conveyance of gas is conducted in ways which are environmentally quite satisfactory. After all, it goes in pipes underground. While we must ensure that it remains environmentally acceptable, what is really important is the use of gas conveyed through the pipes. Therefore, I hope that that will be a non-controversial amendment.

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 438</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="50622-10_para28"></a>Secondly, I believe that the reference to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the objective of achieving sustainable development",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para29"></a>is important because we must bear in mind that the satisfaction of consumers is important; that the stimulation of competition is important; but that making that consistent with environmental development is equally important.
<P>

<a name="50622-10_para30"></a>I do not believe that any energy industry can now thrive which does not take sufficient account of environmental pressures. We had vivid proof of that the other day in what happened to the Shell oil rig, the company not having taken sufficient account of environmental pressures. Let it be stated in the Bill that that has to be done. I am sure that any self-respecting supplier&#151;I certainly include myself in that&#151;would take environmental considerations seriously. This is not something that any supplier would regard as limiting his freedom of action; on the contrary, it supports the proper supplier in the discharge of his responsibilities. I very much support the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, in Amendment No. 17.

<A NAME="50622-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wade of Chorlton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, referred to the importance of taking account of environmental matters, and he referred to the Shell platform. Yet surely here was an instance when all the facts concerning the scientific nature and the environmental benefits of the disposal of the platform were taken into account, but there was an emotional response to those matters. It is important to understand that when we include these phrases in legislation we are dealing with what is scientifically sustainable and with courses of action that are sensible in environmental terms and are based on scientific evidence, and not with emotional evidence that often holds sway. History tells us that an emotional response works against the interests of society as a whole.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   This is an interesting set of amendments and it is the nearest we get to placing the Bill in the context of energy policy and long-term development. I would say immediately to the noble Lord, Lord Wade, that I take a hard-headed view as to how we approach the environment. We must consider environmental damage, but we must also consider the cost side. I believe there is nothing between us on that. As regards the oil rig that was mentioned, one could argue whether that matter was examined correctly at any stage. However, I take it that there is no suggestion from the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook&#151;there is certainly no suggestion from the rest of us&#151;that one can achieve what one wants with the environment without cost. That is not what we are arguing. I do not think that there is a free ride as regards the environment other than if we approach the environment correctly, that will be enormously beneficial, in particular to our successors. The environmental damage that we suffer was inflicted by our predecessors who did not consider these issues carefully. That is certainly the meaning I give to what the noble Earl refers to as sustainable development. I believe that that involves taking a view into the future and asking ourselves whether we take properly into account, in considering the needs of the future, the costs placed on future generations.
<P>


<a name="column_439"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 439</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para0"></a>I agree with the noble Earl that it has long been recognised that one of the weaknesses of the uncontrolled free market is that it does not lead to an optimal outcome. That does not mean that one destroys the free market; it merely means that one modifies its workings in certain circumstances to improve the outcome. I hope that we are all in agreement on that. I believe that my noble friend Lady Hilton of Eggardon will deal with our Amendment No. 16, which falls within this context, but I want it to be dealt with separately.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para1"></a>I wish to refer to two matters. The main one concerns whether the noble Earl has anything to add&#151;we always use government figures anyway&#151;on recoverable gas reserves in all their different forms: that is, the proven reserves, the probable reserves and the possible reserves. Is it still the department's view that, on perhaps the most pessimistic assumptions, we have, at present rates of use, some 35 years of reserves, or, more optimistically, that we might get as much as 45 years of gas reserves? I am not a great believer in these long-term forecasts anyway. I can still remember, as can other Members of the Committee, the first time I heard that North Sea gas had been discovered. I remember that the reaction was, "Hoorah, there is gas in the North Sea, but we are going to use it up before you can look round". As far as I know, although we have been using it up at a tremendous rate we still seem to have lots of it. I am never as pessimistic as others in this regard. This reminds me of the estimates that economists made of coal reserves in the 19th century. The economists proved to everyone's satisfaction that we would run out of coal in about the first quarter of the 20th century. As it is, quite the reverse has happened and we ended up with far more coal than anyone was ever able to find a use for.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para2"></a>I am not pessimistic as regards gas, but that does not mean that I do not take the question of reserves seriously. I hope that when the noble Earl replies he will say whether there is any more up-to-date information he can give us on that. I also hope that he will say whether he regards it as being within the remit of the director, as already stated, to consider matters of this kind. Perhaps the noble Earl could say whether he thinks Amendment No. 18 standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Haskel is not needed from that point of view because the director would make this provision anyway. I hope the noble Earl will be able to say that. Essentially I am trying to be as supportive as I can. I am enormously looking forward to hearing the subtleties of the difference between Amendments Nos. 20 and 22, because I do not think I could write an exam answer on the difference in meaning between those two amendments. Subject to that, my desire has been to be as helpful as I can on this.

<A NAME="50622-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wade of Chorlton: </B>   I wish to make one further comment on the point that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has just made. Past progress shows us that sustainable development is not just a matter of trying to conserve the resources we already have; it is also a matter of allowing society to find solutions to the changing needs for resources and the changing costs of resources. I should strike a note of caution as regards these kinds of amendments. Although, on the one hand, they appear to be helpful in terms of protecting what we have, at the same time we must be careful that they do not limit the <P>

It is interesting to note that throughout history we have always satisfied people's needs to a greater rather than to a lesser extent, and we have provided the free market to do that.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wade. I am certain that in perhaps 50 years from now when we are all long gone&#151;perhaps not all of us; the younger Peers present will still be with us, assuming they are still Members of this Chamber or its successor body&#151;people in this Chamber will wonder why we wasted time discussing whether gas would run out when they know that the only fuel one uses is something I cannot even think of. The noble Lord is quite right in that regard. However, that does not mean that one neglects a valuable asset while one has it. There are two sides to this matter. The world is always surprising us but this is a valuable asset and we do not wish to see it wasted. I do not think there is any difference between us on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-11_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said that he was not quite certain what the physical environment was. I am bound to tell him that I knew the additional word would upset the noble Lord, Lord Peston. We considered it all and we thought that we had better satisfy the noble Lord. Had he been more on the ball and put down the amendment himself, I would have been able to accept it. However, he did not do that, and he accuses me of not accepting amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I would never doubt the noble Earl's word. I take it he is telling me that if I had tabled the amendment, that would not have been regarded as automatically to be rejected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-11_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My admiration for the noble Lord, Lord Peston, would have increased even more had he put it down. However, as he did not, my admiration drops a rung or two down the ladder, but it is still high. It is, I am bound to say, an unrivalled pleasure to share the sponsorship of an amendment with my noble friend Lord Cranbrook. I share his view that it is necessary to include a definition of the environment. The change was also suggested by the Energy Saving Trust which has held a number of helpful meetings with my department. This provision does meet its concern that the use of the term "physical environment" might be taken not to include the atmosphere.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, said that he was entranced by the subtleties of the difference between the two amendments. I am bound to say that I am a little fascinated by that but only marginally, because I am not quite certain what the difference is. However, I have no doubt that my noble friend will tell me, as he will tell the rest of the Committee later.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para4"></a>The use of the definition of the word "environment" from the Environmental Protection Act, which was also used in the Railways Act 1993, will make it clear that the effects which the director and the Secretary of State must take into account include damage to the atmosphere resulting from the leakage of methane. Therefore, I am glad that my noble friend and I share a common view on that.

<P>

<a name="50622-11_para5"></a>I fear, however, that I cannot be so encouraging about my noble friend's suggestion that the director should have a statutory duty to take account of the objective of achieving sustainable development. The Government attach great importance to that principle. We believe that the Bill will promote sustainable development by harnessing the forces of the profit motive to provide incentives for the efficient use of gas and not the wasteful use of it, which is anti-social to the environment. There is also a specific duty in relation to the efficient use of gas which covers energy efficiency matters. Condition 16 of the draft licence requires energy efficiency advice to be provided. Those measures, together with others in the Bill, will help promote a sustainable development, although the words may not appear on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para6"></a>I am afraid that one particular difficulty with my noble friend's proposal is the lack of a satisfactory definition of "sustainable development". The 1995 Act, referred to in the amendment, leaves the matter to guidance from the Secretary of State. While that may be entirely appropriate for an environmental regulator such as the new environment agency, it would cause difficulties in the case of an economic regulator. That is because it could cut across the principle of an independent regulator and, having regard to the breadth of the regulator's powers, that could cause unacceptable uncertainty.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, wants me to say that his Amendment No. 18 is unnecessary. I did not do that because I feared that the noble Lord might be upset but I believe that I can satisfy him about that. It is unnecessary. He mentioned in his amendment three specific matters to which the director should have regard in performing her duties. In broad terms, those were oil reserves, the Rio Summit of 1992 and funding the Energy Saving Trust.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para8"></a>I should remind the Committee that the introduction of competition will in itself provide a spur to energy efficiency. While a monopoly supplier has no financial incentive to reduce the overall size of the market, competing suppliers are interested only in increasing their slice of the market, not in the overall size. The Bill, which also allows for suppliers to compete to sell energy packages&#151;warm houses, as it were, rather than therms of gas&#151;therefore removes a major disincentive to energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para9"></a>Amendment No. 18 suggests that the director should have regard to official estimates of the amount of discovered and recoverable reserves of gas. That proposition rather reminds one of the 1970s arguments over depletion policy which the party opposite talked about. We believe that such issues are for the market to resolve. In any event, if the director were to consider the question of gas reserves she might well think there was no need to worry about energy efficiency, as the amount of new gas found on the United Kingdom continental shelf has been greater than production in recent years, despite the fact that production has been rising more quickly each year.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para10"></a>The question of whether the director should have regard to the "Rio commitments" was discussed in another place, when it was noted that the Government expect to achieve those targets, with some considerable margin, by the year 2000. That will be done through a variety of measures which are already in place. Placing a <P>


<a name="column_442"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 442</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>duty on the director to consider that might therefore also have the perverse effect of encouraging a relaxation of effort on energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para11"></a>The question of the funding of projects through the Energy Saving Trust has now been resolved by the announcement by the Secretary of State for the Environment on 11th May that he was making &#163;25 million available annually to the EST between 1996 and when the gas and electricity markets are fully liberalised. That will enable the EST to promote innovative pump-priming schemes which are designed to take advantage of and enhance the effectiveness of the developing competitive markets for energy and energy services. Those measures will be able to operate without raising gas prices, which would have been the only way the regulator could have funded the trust.
<P>

<a name="50622-11_para12"></a>I hope that I have been able to persuade the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that Amendment No. 18 is not necessary.

<A NAME="50622-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   With regard to Amendment No. 17, the noble Earl told us that he is not disposed to accept the objective of achieving sustainable development. I have no doubt that the noble Earl, Lord Cranbrook, will deal with that. But the Minister did not indicate whether he would accept the first part of the amendment which adds the words:

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I meant to make it clear that I am not keen on that and therefore I do not advise the Committee to accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Cranbrook: </B>   I have indicated to the Committee that I should like to return to Amendments Nos. 20 and 22 because they deal with separate issues.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para0"></a>Amendment No. 14 is linked to Amendment No. 15, which I assume the Committee will accept, and in particular to Amendment No. 17. Amendment No. 14 is a necessary precursor of Amendment No. 17 because it creates paragraph (i).
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para1"></a>I apologise for the fact that I raise this matter rather precipitously. That is because my attention was focused so sharply by my experiences of the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development. It is extremely important that full consideration should be given to the Round Table's deliberations, but I recognise that I have given the Committee very short notice and very little time for the matters to be assimilated at official level. Nevertheless, as Members of the Committee who care to consult the documents, copies of which are placed in the Library, will see, it brought together an extremely powerful group of people who gave their time to put their heads together for that one day.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para2"></a>My amendments were prompted by my appreciation of how important it is that we should consider the use of gas because it contributes directly to the carbon dioxide load; and how important it is that ultimately there should be reference to sustainable development in the Bill. Therefore, for the time being I wish to withdraw the <P>


<a name="column_443"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 443</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments but I believe that it is appropriate that they should be considered in due course and I shall return to this matter on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before that happens, will the noble Earl make clear which amendments he is withdrawing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Cranbrook: </B>   I shall withdraw Amendment No. 14 and I shall not move Amendment No. 17 because they are inextricably linked. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para3"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers </B>   moved Amendment No. 15:

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 18, leave out ("physical").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-12_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, for asking that question because I had a horrible feeling that my amendment might have gone down the plughole. That is not the intention and I beg to move Amendment No. 15.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para5"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 19, after ("with") insert ("the construction of any pipeline and").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-12_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: I am now totally at a loss as to what is going on. I was looking forward to hearing an explanation of Amendments Nos. 20 and 22 which are grouped with the amendments that we have just debated. Shall we be returning to those amendments in a few moments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Cranbrook: </B>   I am working on the assumption that my noble friend will move Amendment No. 20, because that amendment stands in his name, and I shall then have the opportunity to speak again to Amendment No. 22 and explain the differences and some of the background.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   That seems to be reasonable. I intend to move Amendment No. 20. I am not certain about the nice nuances in relation to those two amendments and I look forward to hearing about those with a certain amount of trepidation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am fairly sure that that is not within our rules but I am always extremely reasonable. I shall not object to that procedure when we reach those amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Cranbrook: </B>   It is perfectly clear that the list of groupings is advisory and not obligatory. I am absolutely sure that it is the correct behaviour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am not suggesting for one moment that it is incorrect behaviour. I am pleased to know that we shall have an explanation in relation to Amendment No. 20 in a few moments. Therefore, I should now like to speak to the amendment standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Hilton of Eggardon. It might have been useful if the amendment had been grouped with the others.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para7"></a>I simply raise briefly&#151;I am sure that my noble friend would have been able to deal with the issue in a more sophisticated way&#151;the question as to why the Bill is written as it is. It refers to the effect on the environment of <P>


<a name="column_444"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 444</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>activities connected with the conveyance of gas through pipes. The amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, refers to, "the use of gas conveyed through pipes." Common sense tells me that what might damage the environment&#151;it is where the issue arises in practice&#151;is the building of pipelines. Once the pipelines have been built underground, with the area made good again, all is well. In the meantime, the environment has taken a terrible beating. I am puzzled as to why the construction of any pipeline was not included.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para8"></a>It may be that that concept is subsumed logically under the conveyance of gas: that one cannot convey it unless one builds some pipes and that therefore if one is taking into account the conveyance of gas, one is taking into account the construction. If that is what the noble Earl is about to tell me, it will satisfy me. If he is not, I emphasise to him that for those who are worried about the world in which we live, digging up the ground and making a terrible mess which seems to go on endlessly is about as bad a destruction of the environment as anything I can think of.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para9"></a>That is the purpose of the amendment. To go back to my earlier remark, I should like to be assured that the amendment is not needed and that the matter is subsumed in the Bill as drafted. It is an important consideration.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_time0"></a><H5>5.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   In this case my noble friend Lord Ferrers will not be able to give the noble Lord, Lord Peston, any satisfaction. I hope that I may be able to do so. Of course, we agree that the construction of gas pipelines that are likely to have significant effects on the environment should only be allowed to go ahead if those effects are properly assessed first and taken into account. That is why it is our intention to bring forward later this year an order under the European Communities Act 1972 to provide that procedure. We believe that those arrangements will meet the concerns underlying the amendment and that in this country we shall continue to have high pressure pipelines installed to our current high standards.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para10"></a>If one thinks about it, it would not be practicable for the director to consider the construction of every single pipeline. Those which are likely to have an environmental impact will be dealt with by environmental assessment. As to those which are not, British Gas has enough short low pressure pipelines to go several times around the world. For the director to consider each addition to this vast spider's web, cat's cradle, call it what you will, would create an enormous bureaucracy to little effect.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para11"></a>It is interesting that earlier the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, commented that this aspect of gas was not environmentally intrusive in general. Any general matters which arise from the pipes which are not subject to environmental assessment will fall within the more general requirement to consider activities connected with the conveyance of gas. I hope that that gives the noble Lord, Lord Peston, some comfort.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, and I apologise to him. Perhaps he will accept that when I refer to the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, it subsumes the noble Earl, Lord <P>


<a name="column_445"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ferrers, the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, and anyone else sitting on the Government Front Bench who fancies speaking.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para12"></a>The noble Lord's answer was extremely reassuring, if I understood it. I gather that such a consideration will be taken into account but that we do not need to provide for it in the Bill because we shall make provision under a European directive that we shall all be extremely pleased to support. Therefore the answer is doubly good.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para13"></a>I accept the fact that we cannot become involved in all the detail. However, such pipelines can be an environmental mess and we wish to have high standards as regards taking into account the environment. I am pleased with the answer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para14"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para15"></a>[Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-12_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness David </B>   moved Amendment No. 19:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 28, at end insert ("or in receipt of one or more of the means-tested benefits").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-12_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are glad that the requirement that the interests of those who are disabled or of pensionable age are taken into account by the Secretary of State and the director general in the exercise of their duties. As one of pensionable age, I am particularly glad that that is so. I noted with amusement that my noble friend has put my name to all those amendments which are attached to those of pensionable age&#151;so here I go!
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para17"></a>We are concerned that the special circumstances of other equally vulnerable consumers are not afforded similar considerations, particularly those on the lowest incomes. For example, the provision of free gas safety checks is one of the tangible benefits currently available to elderly and disabled customers. Yet the risks of using poorly maintained or rarely serviced gas appliances are not confined to those consumers.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para18"></a>It is a fact that those on the lowest incomes may be at much greater risk because they are less able to afford the costs of servicing equipment than many pensioners or disabled people. Similarly, the commitment not to disconnect pensioner households in the winter months recognises that elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the dangers of hypothermia and cold-related illnesses. However, the same is true of young children, as the Government recognise through their scheme for making extra payments to meet fuel costs for income support claimants in periods of severe weather.
<P>

<a name="50622-12_para19"></a>We wish therefore to see some additional degree of protection afforded to customers who are financially disadvantaged. That means that we wish to add the words in the amendment,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or in receipt of one or more of the means-tested benefits".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for explaining her amendment. We recognise that pensioners and disabled people have special needs in relation to gas. As she pointed out, they may be more susceptible to cold if the supply fails. They may need prepayment meters moved to more accessible locations. They may need adaptors for appliances or help with safety checks.
<P>


<a name="column_446"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para0"></a>However, the real interest of low income consumers is in cheaper gas. That is very similar to the interests of all other customers. Low income customers do not have special requirements as to the quality of gas supply services provided.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para1"></a>Nor is it accurate to equate low income customers with those likely to default on gas charges. Many poor people make a point of saving up in advance and paying their gas bills as soon as they arrive. Indeed, if one considers across society it is by no means always the case that those who are the least well off are the most reluctant to pay their bills.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para2"></a>It is right that it should be the director's duty to consider those who might be at risk of disconnection. That is covered by the duty to protect the interests of consumers as respects continuity of supply. Adequate provision already exists in the Bill. All suppliers, as a condition of their licences, will have to follow debt and disconnection procedures, which will protect any customer who has genuine difficulties in paying promptly due to misfortune or inability to deal with gas supplied on credit terms. I hope that that helps to explain the current position as set out in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene for a moment. There is nothing between us. It has been the theme throughout that we all benefit from cheap gas in real terms. However, we are also interested in the quality of service.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para3"></a>The noble Lord has put the Government's position as clearly as he can. The logic of it is that while pensioners and disabled people have an interest in the real price of gas, as we all do, they have some additional interests. Does the Minister ask us to accept that very poor people do not have additional interests? One can single out the old or disabled; they have special interests. We do not disagree. But, as my noble friend argues, separate from the real price of gas, low income earners have other interests as regards service, the availability of supplies, and so on. That is for one good reason. Those people often have difficulty coping with life. I do not seek to denigrate that group. In emphasising the interests of old people, the noble Lord does not suggest that they all have problems. He simply states that some within the group have problems.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para4"></a>I believe that we on these Benches maintain a valid position in emphasising this factor. We refer to "means-tested benefits" as the criteria because one has to find simple language rather than use the general word "poor", or the phrase "unable to cope". Logically, the Government should think more about the matter, especially since&#151;I emphasise this, as it goes with points we made earlier on energy efficiency&#151;we are not asking a great deal in the amendment. All that is asked is that the director "shall take into account." There is no duty. We do not use the word "promote"; we do not even have the word "secure". The amendment simply relates to the very limited idea, "take into account". A sensitive, caring Government&#151;I know that we are in the presence of leading Ministers&#151;would take this idea very seriously as an additional criterion. I am not clear whether we shall press this amendment to a Division. I shall leave that decision to my noble friend. However, the Government <P>


<a name="column_447"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may wish to reflect upon providing a form of words, broadening what the director shall take account of in this broad area. That is my point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   There is a serious point here which I hope that my noble friend the Minister will consider. The definition,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"those who are disabled or of pensionable age",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para5"></a>seems to exclude quite a number of people who suffer physical disabilities or weaknesses of one sort or another. After all, you are not disabled or of pensionable age if you happen to have suffered very severe and prolonged illness which does not actually constitute disability, and you may still be below pensionable age. It appears that the very proper provision made in the Bill for these two categories should be examined to see whether it goes far enough. My view is that it should be extended. Whether the precise terms of the amendment, referring to those in receipt of means tested benefits generally, are right, I am not certain. But some expansion of the categories should be considered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   Can my noble friend tell me what is meant by "disabled" in the Bill? Does the word not need a definition?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Before my noble friend answers that question, in the debates on social security legislation I have often made the point that it is my standard belief that disabled people are people first, and disabled second. There is a certain logic in that. I see the noble Lord, Lord Peston, nodding.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para6"></a>To carry that thought through to this Bill and this amendment, I certainly go along with my noble friend Lord Inglewood. He suggests that just because people are on means tested benefit it does not mean that they need special protection vis-o-vis the Bill. What it does mean is that they need special protection from the point of view of the value of means tested benefits, and all the back-up and passported benefits to which that leads.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para7"></a>I conclude that domestic gas customers on means tested benefits have virtually the same needs, with the exception of paying for the gas, as do domestic gas customers who are not on means tested benefits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   As to what "disabled" means, the Disability Discrimination Bill now before the House includes a very adequate description of what constitutes a disabled person. Surely it would be logical for the Government to use the same definition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am extremely grateful to the Members of the Committee who have participated in this helpful debate on an important subject. Perhaps I may try to elaborate the position. Obviously, we shall consider carefully the points made; they are of importance to all kinds of people.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para8"></a>So far as any definition of "disability" is concerned, as my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes pointed out we discussed the matter at great length in relation to the Disability Discrimination Bill&#151;as I know to my cost! To take the word "disabled" in this context, Condition 17 of the draft standard conditions of the gas suppliers' <P>


<a name="column_448"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 448</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>licence, spells out what is meant. The definition given is a registered disabled person or someone in receipt of social security benefit by reason of disability.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para9"></a>The fundamental point that we have discussed was introduced by&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   Perhaps my noble friend will give way. I understood that the term "registered disabled" would be discontinued after the Bill comes into force.

<A NAME="50622-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for making that point which we shall no doubt have to consider carefully in the context of the draft conditions.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para10"></a>The crux of the debate relates to whether or not the requirements of people who are less well off are in some way qualitatively different from those of people who are disabled or old. Our approach has been that those people's requirements are essentially subsumed into the wider definition of "consumer" which is found in new Section 4(3) which we are discussing.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para11"></a>It seems to us that the kind of problems in which consumers on low incomes are interested are exactly the same type as those problems in which all consumers are interested. Since they are part of the larger group, it follows that their interests are inherently at the heart of the concerns of the director in considering this matter in the general terms set out.
<P>

<a name="50622-13_para12"></a>I accept entirely the point made by my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter. We shall seriously reflect upon it. We do not want to find that we have created a hole through which some people may fall. It is our view, however, that the position of the people described will be properly covered by the definition in this part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   I am obliged to my noble friend for saying that he will look into the question. It seems to me that you cannot run the two arguments together; namely, that the Bill generally takes care of all cases of hardship and need but that there should be special provisions for those who are disabled or of pensionable age. If disabled people or those of pensionable age are given a special status, it is very important that the line of demarcation separating them from others should be drawn at the right place. All I did was express a doubt as to whether that was so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-13_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I am extremely grateful for the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. It seems to me that there is not much logic in the remarks of the noble Lord on the Front Bench. If all consumers are to be considered, certainly the disabled and the elderly are part of that group. I do not see any reason why the very poor should not be considered in the same way as the disabled and the elderly. I understand that the noble Lord intends to take this amendment back and look at it again, as the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, asked. If he is prepared to do that, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-14_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: We discussed this amendment earlier. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-14_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Cranbrook: </B>   I wish to make two points in relation to Amendment No. 22 which is grouped with Amendment No. 20. First, I received a comment from a friend of mine who is a professor of law that the duty to "take into account" which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, just mentioned and which is the subject of the subsection is perhaps the weakest possible duty that is worth specifying in law. This point is very important. I certainly intend, by withdrawing my amendment, to give my noble friend the opportunity to take this matter back and consider it in the context of the debate on sustainability that is fundamental to all government policy at the moment. In this Committee, we have been cross-referring to other Bills and other debates in this Chamber. I should like to import into the discussion the debate on the difference between "further" and "taking into account" that we had during the passage of the Environment Bill. If the environment is to be given parity, as it has to be within the context of sustainability, the duty to "take into account" is phenomenally weak. That is one point that I wanted to make.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para1"></a>I said that I would disclose the difference between my noble friend's amendment and my amendment, Amendment No. 22. It is that he has restricted the definition of "the environment" to Section 1(2) of the Environmental Protection Act, whereas I refer to the entire section. Section 1(2) of the Environmental Protection Act defines the "environment" as consisting of "the air, water and land" and so on, and "the air within other natural or man-made structures". Subsection (3) goes on to define pollution in terms of harm to the environment. Then, subsection (4) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Harm' means harm to the health of living organisms or other interference with the ecological systems of which they form part",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para2"></a>and so on. I want to be absolutely sure that if we accept a definition of the environment that is only based on Section 1(2), it is big enough to include not merely the inanimate things that are mentioned. That would leave us, in my view, back where we were with the "physical environment". If we are talking about the physical environment we are talking about air, water and land. But it seems to me absolutely essential that we should make it quite clear that, by removing "physical"&#151;as we have done by Amendment No. 15&#151;we include in the environment the health of living organisms, the protection of ecological systems, and so on. That is the proper definition of the environment.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para3"></a>I hope that my noble friend will give himself the opportunity to consider that, from the point of view of sustainability, we must consider not merely the physical environment. We have taken out "physical" and must make sure that the definition of environment includes living organisms. That is why my amendment differs from my noble friend's amendment. I refer to the whole of Section 1 and he refers to only one subsection.
<P>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 450</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para4"></a>Let me make a third point. My noble friend has already commented on the inadequacy of my definition of sustainable development. I agree that it is very difficult to define. Nonetheless, it is said to be a fundamental plank of government policy. In order to find some sort of peg on which to hang this matter, I referred to what will be a clause of what is still a Bill&#151;I suppose that it is a passage in a Bill and therefore capable of refinement in theory, but I needed some sort of peg. I agree with my noble friend's criticism that it is not a particularly good peg to hang sustainable development on. But if sustainable development is a key plank of all government policy, somewhere there must be some definition of it.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para5"></a>A definition is beginning to emerge. Perhaps I may quote from the draft management statement of the Environment Agency which has been released. It says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The basis of the strategy is a commitment to the goal of sustainable development. This seeks to reconcile the dual objectives of achieving economic development and of providing effective protection and enhancement of the environment".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para6"></a>That is perhaps an acceptable definition of sustainable development. Those are the Government's own words.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para7"></a>If my noble friend can assure me that reference to Section 1(2) of the Environmental Protection Act brings in the living environment as well as the physical environment, I shall believe that my peg was not that bad. Reference to Section 4 of what will be the Environment Act would by inference bring in the draft management statement of the Environment Agency. I give notice that I shall withdraw Amendment No. 22 in order that proper consideration may be given to this issue, and I can come back at Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-14_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   If the Committee is good enough to accept Amendment No. 20, I shall certainly look into the point to see whether or not the matters referred to by the noble Earl in Amendment No. 22 are covered. The draftsman suggested putting in Section 1(2), as in my amendment. I shall certainly consider the matter further in the light of what my noble friend said. If he is content with that, and I hope that he will be, I suggest that Amendment No. 20 be agreed to.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para8"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston </B>   moved Amendment No. 21:

<FONT SIZE=2><br>

<br>
("( ) In performing his duty under subsection (2) above the Director shall ensure that any one gas supplier charges at a uniform rate across Great Britain.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-14_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: I have searched for some way to introduce into these deliberations the whole question of pricing, charging and so on. I found it very difficult. There is not much about that in the Bill and what there is will probably be in the standard licences and such matters. Some of that material I have only had sight of in the past day or so.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para10"></a>Harkening back to the Second Reading of the Bill, I asked what was the Government's view of the report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to the effect that a consequence of this Bill introducing competition would be that some consumers would suffer higher prices. I assume that the argument would have been that as the British Gas monopoly, regulated in private hands, is engaged in a degree of cross-subsidisation or <P>


<a name="column_451"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 451</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>something of that kind, or else for goodwill, it was felt desirable that everybody should pay the same price for gas. But there is no obligation to do so once there is much more of a free market. On the one hand, people will charge what the market can bear and, on the other hand, their prices will be more finely tuned to the cost of supply. That, I think, was the nature of the argument.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para11"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, first replied:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no reason to believe that competition will lead to higher prices for any consumers".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para12"></a>That was his answer. I had already argued&#151;as I have just repeated&#151;that I could think of quite good reasons why that might lead to increases in prices for some consumers, and so did the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But then the noble Earl added, quite rightly:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, the nature of a competitive market is that one can never guarantee that. There may be some price variations on the general downward trend and we must see what the result is".&#151;[Official Report, 6/6/95; col. 1302.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para13"></a>I do not know what that means.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para14"></a>I tabled this amendment to obtain some clarification of the Government's view, first, on what they believe more precisely is likely to happen; and, secondly, on what they consider is desirable. If one were wearing a very harsh, hard economist's hat, one would say&#151;to return to the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, who was, I believe, referring to the south west&#151;that if it is more expensive to deliver gas to consumers in the south-west, that is too bad and they will have to pay more. That would be what one would say wearing the classic economist's hat.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para15"></a>I am interested in whether that is what the Government believe and say, "Well, that is all right. That is the way markets work and we have to accept that". I myself make no value judgment. At the moment, I am still in an exploratory mood on this matter, wanting to know what would happen. We may have to come back to this matter when I have explored the licences rather more carefully and know what would be involved.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para16"></a>Let me put the matter as simply as I can. With my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis I state in this amendment that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Director shall ensure that any one gas supplier charges at a uniform rate across Great Britain".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para17"></a>Am I right in believing that that is not remotely the intention of the Bill and that the Government would not accept that point? Would they say, "That is now a complete irrelevance so far as the working of the free market is concerned"?
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para18"></a>The amendment has been tabled in order to find a view and a clarification of what the Government believe is likely to happen and equally what the Government believe ought to happen. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I find the amendment rather dangerous. I have checked on what various suppliers do. For example, Marks and Spencer tell me that one pays the same in central London as in the north of Scotland. But I went on an official parliamentary visit to Boots. I was interested to see that in Watford I was able to buy items more cheaply than I could buy them in central London&#151;the same shop and the same stock. It was explained to me that that was because the overheads were very much less in Watford. I thought that if I had been <P>


<a name="column_452"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 452</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>buying a large quantity of articles, it would have almost paid me to drive out there. Retailers and, I imagine, suppliers, would think the same way.
<P>

<a name="50622-14_para19"></a>But what worries me most of all is that if there were an obligation to charge the same price everywhere, surely that would encourage the competition only to offer to supply in the area that was the most profitable. That is what worries me. Rather than consider offering to supply somewhere non-profitable, people would say, "Yes, I shall offer it all at the same price but I shall restrict the places where I am prepared to do it". I believe that this is a dangerous amendment.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950622/text/50622-15.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   On that point, there is the consideration that there is a cost to move gas around the country. I have no idea what TransCo's charging policy is or may be in the future, and I do not expect the noble Lord knows either. But it would be perfectly logical&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Peston, will see it if he puts on his economist's hat&#151;for it to be charged by, for example, the mile of transport. It is perfectly obvious therefore that one is bound to have different charges for domestic gas in various parts of the country, depending on how far from the landing terminal the customer is.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para0"></a>I am sure that the point raised by my noble friend Lady Gardner about the corporate costs in specific areas of the country will also come into play. Gas company A may sell gas at one price in Scotland and exactly the same company may sell exactly the same gas from exactly the same source at a different price in North Yorkshire or the East End of London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   I hope that my noble friend the Minister will resist this amendment. It would be pernicious in its effect in two ways. First, it would discourage the producer of gas from producing it for supply to an area where the cost of supplying it&#151;because of distance or other physical factors&#151;is too high; the producer will simply not move in to that area. Secondly, where the sale of gas is highly profitable, it prevents a reduction being made in order to maintain and develop a good market. Therefore, restricting either increase or decrease of the standard rate would be extremely harmful to the whole operation of the system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   There is another complication to be taken into account. There are shades of the old railway clearing house, which I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Peston, as an economist, will remember, where there were published rates for every class of goods on the railways. All anybody had to do who wanted to compete with the railways was to go below that rate. Were prices to be uniform for any one supplier across the United Kingdom, they would be subject to that sort of selective competition.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para1"></a>The situation is further complicated by the fact that the actual cost in any locality by any one supplier across the United Kingdom will not, as my noble friend observed, be uniform. Therefore, were the amendment to be adopted, it would produce less competition rather than more, and would be detrimental to the interests of consumers. For that reason it should not be adopted.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am grateful to Members of the Committee for the debate on this important point. In reply to the basic proposition of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, as to whether he is right, I am afraid that, like my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, we do not think he is. However, I will endeavour, in this probing amendment, to indicate what we think will happen and what is desirable.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para2"></a>I am afraid that what has been proposed simply will not work. Its effect would be to deter national suppliers from entering the market. A national supplier bound to a uniform price structure would not be able to compete against a regional supplier operating in a less expensive region, unless he cut his national prices so he was losing money in the more expensive regions. The most likely outcome would be for him to split his business in two. That way his position would be preserved and he would defeat the purpose of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para3"></a>The point made about consumers is important. If the system described by the noble Lord were in operation, in areas where it was possible for people to supply gas at a lower price than elsewhere in the network of any specific supplier, the consumers in that locality would be paying more than they need. That does not seem to me to be in the interests of consumers; nor does it seem to be a proper operation of the principles of competition, about which we heard earlier in the debate this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para4"></a>We must always remember that, while price variations may emerge, this is set against a strong general downward pressure on prices. Independent suppliers are saying that they can beat British Gas's prices by 10 per cent. To hang on to the old-fashioned approach risks sacrificing the benefits of competition in the name of equality. That is not in the interests of the public. If one looks around, there are plenty of commodities of an identical nature which cost different amounts in different parts of the country. For example, beer is a commodity that a number of us buy from time to time. It is differently priced in different areas. Another example is housing. Two physically identical houses can cost considerably different sums of money in different parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para5"></a>The amendment implies that customers in the south west, and other outlying regions, will be disadvantaged by the introduction of competition. Judging by the response to the recent consultation on where competition should initially be introduced, it would seem that customers in the south west do not agree. We had many requests from local authorities and MPs from the south west&#151;no doubt friends and neighbours of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale&#151;urging for the area to be the first to benefit from competition in gas supply.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para6"></a>The truth is that there has never been a requirement for a uniform pricing structure for gas throughout the country. When such proposals were made in 1986, they were explicitly rejected by Parliament, which preferred to back the Minister's view that suppliers should be able to charge prices that reflect overall costs. Ofgas has said that the present variation in long-distance pipeline tariffs is likely, if passed on by suppliers, to involve a differential of plus or minus 2 per cent. of final prices.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para7"></a>I hope that that gives an indication of our view of the current background to this proposal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the Minister. He may be surprised to know that I agree with most of what has been said, which was the whole point of tabling the amendment. On the question of the difference in cost of supply across the country, that is always a subject that has intrigued me as an economist. The noble Baroness named Marks & Spencer, and Sainsbury's also seems to charge the same. I did not know, and would have guessed the opposite, that Boots did not. I am amazed to discover that Boots has differential pricing according to the cost of transport. However, I gather that a senior Boots' person will soon be joining the House and we can ask him about his company's pricing policy. I have always been surprised at the uniformity of prices in some of our major companies.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para8"></a>My point relates precisely to what noble Lords have said; that there are differences in the costs of supply; the working of a competitive market will reflect those costs. But British Gas, whether or not it has a legal obligation to do so, did not set its prices in that way, which is why the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said that some consumers' prices may be increased. That was the point of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para9"></a>The Minister has committed himself, unless he changes his mind&#151;supported by his noble friends&#151;to the argument that if somewhere, in some marginal constituency at some critical moment in the near future, the effect of competition is for British Gas to say, "We are not interested any more; we have been supplying the gas to this area and losing money on it; we are out", the new supplier will come in competitively and say, "I can make a living here, at a higher price". The Government will say, "Excellent". They will say to one of their right honourable friends, "I am sorry; you have just lost your seat on this, but that is the effect of the market and we believe in the market".
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para10"></a>That is what underlines my arguments. I do not disagree with the noble Lord's analysis of how the market will work. However, I cannot see how the Government can accept that analysis and also say that prices for some people will not go up. There must at least be a danger for some people that they will go up because, to use my own expression, the new suppliers must be more finely tuned to the cost of supply. That is the point. I tabled the amendment not because I felt that one could do this, but precisely because, as the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, said, one cannot do this in the new market. The consequences will be serious for a few, perhaps a minority, but a few.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Before the noble Lord decides what to do with the amendment, he should bear in mind the natural economic activity of the customer and potential customer. He postulated a case where British Gas has been supplying at a loss for years and a competitor comes along and offers gas at a higher price. The consumer will not accept that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   The noble Lord misses the point. I am not privy to the detail of British Gas's costings, and presumably nor is the noble Lord. But, to use an <P>


<a name="column_455"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expression which I hate, it is common knowledge that there is some degree of cross-subsidisation in the private monopoly, as there was in the public monopoly.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para11"></a>I take it that British Gas, whose duty it must be to make a living, to make a profit and to behave economically, will look at some of its activities and say, "We no longer have a duty to supply at below cost". Therefore, it will get out of the market. That is the point I am making. Someone else will come in and say, "I can supply in this market but it will be at a higher price". That is my only argument. I am not suggesting that it will happen all over the place. On the contrary, British Gas will operate competitively very effectively where it can. But if I am right&#151;I have not seen the figures&#151;that there is some cross-subsidy, the market will remove it and that will affect those consumers.
<P>

<a name="50622-15_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, has said, "So be it", and in a sense he is right. That is what markets do. Those of us in London cannot suddenly have a row with Boots because the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, has told us that somewhere in the country we can get our razor blades more cheaply. Again, so be it. Having said that, I moved the amendment in order to hear the Government's view. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("( ) In performing his duties under this Part, the Director shall&#151;
<br>
(a) take all reasonable steps to consult persons or bodies appearing to the Director to be representative of persons or bodies likely to be affected by the performance of those duties; and
<br>
(b) take all reasonable steps to explain and publicise his reasons for any decision made under this Part." ").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-16_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: This is another amendment concerning consumers. Various consumer bodies have been in touch with many of your Lordships. They believe that the Bill is deficient in that it does not oblige the director general to consult them, to take their views into account, and so on. They do not understand&#151;I am certain that I am not the only noble Lord whom they have approached on the matter&#151;why the duty to consult people who represent consumer views is not put explicitly on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para1"></a>The director has to take into account the interests of consumers but in practice the way to do that is to consult these bodies. They are extremely effective, they are extremely well-informed and they are extremely intelligent. The point of the amendment is to press the Government to take the matter seriously and at least to begin to answer why the consumer bodies have been left out. Were they left out on purpose, or were they left out because they were forgotten? I am seeking some arguments and reasons.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para2"></a>My own judgment is that at this stage this would be a useful amendment to include. I am not saying that in many years to come, if the industry settles down and is seen to be working well, problems of this kind will arise on any great scale.

The Government are strongly in favour of the regulation of the gas industry being as transparent as possible. In practice, the director general consults widely on all significant decisions. That is good administrative practice and we applaud it.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para3"></a>The Bill nevertheless provides for specific consultation obligations in respect of the more significant functions of the director. She is required to consult before making any substantive licence modification under Section 23 or before making any modification to the standard conditions of licences at the time when a licence is granted&#151;that is, new Section 8 of the Bill, provided for in Clause 8. These are among the most important procedures by which the director will be able to give effect to the duties set out in Clauses 1 and 2.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para4"></a>These sections contain obligations on the director to give notice stating that she proposes to make the modifications and setting out their effect and stating the reasons why she proposes to make the modifications. Notice is to be given so as to bring it to the attention of persons likely to be affected by the modifications and the director is also specifically required to send a copy to relevant licence holders, to the Secretary of State, to the Health and Safety Executive and to the Gas Consumers' Council. All representations must then be considered.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para5"></a>There are also requirements to consult, tailored to meet the appropriate requirements of the case, contained where necessary within other parts of the Bill which confer specific functions on the Secretary of State or on the director.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para6"></a>I believe that this approach is more appropriate than the blanket requirement proposed by Amendment No. 23. It allows for as much consultation as is necessary in each case, without imposing an unreasonable burden on the Secretary of State or the director.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para7"></a>A requirement to consult on all decisions and give reasons in each case would lead to the whole regulatory process becoming gummed up. It would also lead to a much more legalistic approach to regulation, with the spectre of judicial review in the background, which might well act to the advantage of large companies rather than consumers as they could afford better to pay for elaborate legal advice. It is better, as we have done, to look at the requirements for consultation very much on a case-by-case basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that reply. He has made one or two good points which I had not thought about. I shall certainly reflect on what he said. It had not occurred to me&#151;but then I am not an expert draftsman&#151;that one had in mind businesses being able to intervene on the same basis as I was assuming consumers and their representatives would be consulted. I shall certainly have to reflect on whether the amendment fails simply because it does not point to what I wanted it to point to.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para8"></a>It was also not my desire to get in the way of efficient administration. The Gas Consumers' Council is an excellent body and I have been very impressed with what <P>


<a name="column_457"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it has done. That is also true of the National Consumers' Council and the Consumers' Association and various of the other bodies which have been in touch with me, including those representing special interests, such as the elderly and so on. I was not trying to argue that I believed that the director would not look at these people. I assumed that the director would be a sensible person who would be in touch with such bodies&#151;she would be foolhardy not to&#151;saying, "This is what I am proposing to do. What do you think?" I am sure the Minister would agree with me that once these bodies knew what was going on they would get in touch with the director anyway and say, "We hear you are thinking of doing this, which we do not like. We would like to submit the following comments to you". I do not think I am over-egging the pudding. I am simply saying that I would like it done in a formal way so that consumer consultation is taken for granted and is not ad hoc.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para9"></a>Having said that, I was impressed by the one or two difficulties which the noble Lord raised. I certainly do not want companies using great batteries of lawyers to hold up important decisions simply because, in the American style, they know that that is the way of avoiding the unpleasant day to come. I would not like my amendment to lead to that under any circumstances. I shall rethink that part. But I believe that I have made my point. The noble Lord has uttered one or two sympathetic remarks, which pleased me. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Haskel </B>   moved Amendment No. 24:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 2, line 31, at end insert:
<br>
("( ) The Secretary of State and the Director shall each have a duty to consult with the Health and Safety Executive with the objective of securing that any public gas transporter, retailer, shipper or supplier who may have cause to undertake work on any gas supply meter, gas fitting or appliance shall ensure that&#151;
<br>
(a) any employee or third party contractor is suitably qualified in the relevant aspects of gas distribution, installation or service;
<br>
(b) any third party contractor undertaking such work is registered with an appropriate recognised trade body approved by the Health and Safety Executive." ").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-16_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 48 and 58. These amendments are about health and safety. The 1986 regulations say that people handling gas and gas appliances should be "competent". We have moved on a long way since then and there are a lot of new suppliers and new firms coming into the business. It appears to me that we ought to define the qualifications rather more precisely. It is a way of raising the standards both for the consumer and also for those who are installing gas equipment and maintaining it. It will also prevent suppliers putting out safety work to non-qualified staff. British Gas has a very high standard of training. Under the existing regulations it maintains that all its people are trained to City and Guilds level or NVQ Level No. 3.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para12"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to see whether there should be some standard of training defined so that the quality of service is maintained. Gas is a dangerous thing to handle. There is no fail-safe as there is with electricity. One does not have a fuse-box with gas, so it is <P>


<a name="column_458"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficult to switch it off. Therefore, it is important to make sure that only properly qualified people handle the appliances and installations. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   These three amendments are totally redundant as the matter is entirely covered by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1994, and the Health and Safety Executive, including the corresponding provisions of the Confederation for the Registration of Gas Installers. The various points made by the noble Lord are entirely covered by the existing arrangements and therefore these amendments are superfluous.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-16_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Perhaps I may first say to the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, that the Government are determined to maintain high levels of safety in the gas industry. That is absolutely vital. I agree with my noble friend Lord Cochrane of Cults that these amendments are redundant because the points raised in them are covered elsewhere. We asked the Health and Safety Commission to undertake a thorough study into all these issues. It did that and we accepted its report.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para13"></a>The matters which the amendments seek to regulate are substantially, and more appropriately, dealt with elsewhere. The principal instrument is the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1994. These require that only competent people may do work on any gas fitting. This includes all gas appliances, pipework in the house beyond the meter and the meter itself. The regulations also require that all companies and self-employed persons doing work on gas fittings must be members of an approved class of persons. At present, that means that they must be registered with CORGI.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para14"></a>Up to the point of the meter, the responsibility for safety lies with the public gas transporter. At present that arises under the general provisions of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, but I understand that the Health and Safety Executive is preparing new regulations to set down more explicit rules in relation to gas pipelines and the management of public gas transporter systems. These will impose specific duties on public gas transporters for the safe construction, maintenance and abandonment of gas pipelines.
<P>

<a name="50622-16_para15"></a>The arrangements which the Government are proposing will meet the necessary requirements of safety. The safety issues which are contained in the noble Lord's amendment are therefore already provided for, either in statute or in regulations. The changes which he is proposing would in fact not only be unnecessary, but cut across those arrangements. I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied that the concerns which he has drawn to our attention are already met.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I am glad that these concerns are already met. I wish to make two comments. As regards registration with CORGI, I understand that it is the company which is registered and not the individual operatives of the company. The company can register itself as a CORGI fitter, but it is not the staff of the company who are registered. That is a point which the noble Earl may like to look into.

<P>

<a name="50622-17_para0"></a>I believe that there should be a closer definition of "competent" if we want to move on and ensure that standards are higher. The word "competent" is not a sufficient definition. However, as I have the noble Earl's assurance that these matters are being taken care of, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para2"></a>Clause 1, as amended, agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston </B>   moved Amendment No. 25:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
After Clause 1, insert the following new clause:
<center><b>("Report on competition and efficiency of gas supply industry</B></center><br>
.&#151;(1) The Director shall prepare annually a report showing&#151;
<br>
(a) the state of competition in the carrying on of activities required to be licensed under section 7A of the 1986 Act;
<br>
(b) the efficiency on the part of persons authorised by or under Part I of the 1986 Act to carry on any activities and the efficient use of gas conveyed through the pipes.
<br>
(2) The Director shall send a copy of the report mentioned in subsection (1) to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State shall lay a copy before each House of Parliament.
<br>
(3) The Director shall from time to time undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the effect of competition in gas supply, shall prepare a document setting out his research and conclusions, shall send a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State shall lay the report before each House of Parliament.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-17_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a long amendment, but pretty straightforward. I believe that we all agree that we are now entering new territory. We moved from a public monopoly to a regulated private monopoly, which introduced some degree of competition in the supply to business premises on a large scale. Now we move to essentially regulated competition. We do not have a great deal of experience of that kind of activity. There is a degree of decentralisation as regards water, but no competition to speak of. I am not certain that anyone will claim that there is competition in electricity supply.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para4"></a>But here I believe that there will be some competition and the question is how it will work. The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, said that we shall have to see and I entirely agree with him. As regards consumer protection, one wonders&#151;to use the words we used earlier&#151;whether it will be effective. We have talked about taking account of the effect on the environment and of promoting energy efficiency. Is any of that going to happen?
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para5"></a>Whatever one's political differences, once we have a Bill of this kind we want it to work. I want it to work and I also want to learn from what is going on. As a parliamentarian, I want to be able to participate in the learning process with a view to seeing what follows.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para6"></a>In the Bill as drafted, I cannot see where I can get any leverage on that point. By that I mean Members of the Committee and how we get involved in assessing what is going on in considering whether competition is working and whether consumers are being satisfied. We also want to know whether all the other good events as a result of this Bill will actually take place.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para7"></a>It seems to me that the easiest way of achieving that is to say that the director prepares a report along the lines I have suggested and that the report goes to the Secretary of State and then it comes before us. That gives us the very first toehold in being able to see what has been going on. That is the main point of the amendment, but it includes a <P>


<a name="column_460"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 460</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>harder final part. I do not believe that it is unfair of me to suggest that this is a worthwhile activity. I agree that it is typically the kind of thing which economists like.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para8"></a>I would like to see the director examine what the benefits of competition have been and whether there have been costs. Do we have any way of assessing whether the benefits exceed whatever costs have been incurred and whether there has been a net advantage? That does not seem to me to be something that the director would be expected to do every year and that is why I merely say, "from time to time". It is a function rather more for the director than for the Secretary of State and the department. I also do not believe that it is something that can be done satisfactorily by academic outsiders because I do not believe that they can get anywhere near the kind of information that they would need.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para9"></a>As the noble Earl is aware, I am not a supporter of the Government, but, viewed as an experiment as to how we might do things, it is enormously interesting. As I say, the regulation of a private, competitive industry where there are energy efficiency and environmental concerns involved should be scrutinised very carefully and we should try to learn from it, particularly as we might then want to carry over those lessons to other sections of the economy.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para10"></a>I press this amendment with very great seriousness. Members of the Committee have a contribution to make in asking the Government to be sensitive to this kind of issue and say, "Yes, we believe that it will work out, but it is an experiment and we shall survey it in a way in which we can learn from it". I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   The amendment that has just been moved obviously has certain merits. The report for which it calls would be of considerable interest. My only hesitation is whether it would impose excessive further burdens on those who have to operate the gas industry. When such changes take place, it is always a temptation for those of us in either House to impose conditions that there shall be full and detailed reports on various aspects of the activity of the organisation concerned. One has to be careful that, in our zest for knowledge of what is going on, we do not impose too heavy a burden on those who already carry responsibility for conducting the industry.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para11"></a>For that reason, I should like to ask my noble friend the Minister whether there exist, in respect of other industries, comparable provisions of any sort. If they do, that means that we have some experience of the burden that they impose and of their value. I am far from dismissing the idea that this is a useful proposal. However, if we are to impose such conditions, we should hesitate to do so if they would be unique and, if they are not unique, it would be interesting to know what other industries have to carry that burden.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Like the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, I find this a constructive and positive amendment which would be most helpful to the Committee in further consideration of this vital issue. After all, we shall spend a great deal of time on this Bill and it is not unreasonable to have the opportunity to return to some of the issues at annual intervals to see how things have gone. I entirely agree with the caveat of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, and should like to know from <P>


<a name="column_461"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Earl whether he agrees in principle with the proposition. If he thinks that the procedures proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, would be too onerous, does he have any other suggestions? I think that we are entitled to ask to be kept informed at suitable intervals about how this new development is going.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   As has been said by noble Lords on all sides, we are certainly entitled&#151;indeed, we expect and want&#151;to be kept informed of the progress of competition policy from the director's viewpoint. On the other hand, I do not think that we want to be snowed under with reports on this, that or the other; nor do I think that they should be so comprehensive that they risk revealing pieces of information which are normally regarded as matters of commercial confidentiality. It therefore occurs to me to wonder whether it would not be much more practical from everybody's point of view for the annual report from the director general of Ofgas to be slightly enlarged to take account of this request which, as has been said on all sides, is perfectly reasonable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-17_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I never cease to admire the capacity of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, to ferret and to delve&#151;and that is a very good thing. Having said that, however, I do not encourage him to do an undue amount of it. In tabling the amendment, he has just probed another point.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para12"></a>It is sometimes difficult in considering a Bill which amends parts of an existing statute, but leaves others in place, to spot when matters are already dealt with in unamended parts of the existing statute.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para13"></a>Section 39 of the Gas Act 1986 already requires the director to prepare an annual report on her activities during the year. That report must be laid before Parliament and it must also include a general survey of developments.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para14"></a>One of the director's proposed statutory duties is to exercise her functions to secure effective competition. Another is to promote efficiency and economy on the part of licensed companies and the efficient use of gas. These matters, which are specifically referred to in Amendment No. 25, must already be dealt with in the director's annual report under Section 39, which is required to cover matters falling within the scope of her functions.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para15"></a>That is, in fact, exactly what happens in practice. The director's latest report for 1994 includes sections on competition and on energy efficiency. It also refers to separate, more detailed Ofgas publications, on both those subjects.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para16"></a>Where I think that the noble Lord may well be on to a good point is that under Section 39, the director's report is to relate to what the director has actually done, but not necessarily to the progress that has been made in securing effective competition. That is the point about which the noble Lord is concerned. I am grateful to him for spotting that the existing provisions may not be sufficient to require a report on the progress of competition, which we are all agreed is necessary.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para17"></a>My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter said that he was concerned about imposing other new burdens and wondered what happens in other organisations. I can advise him that, like other regulators, the rail regulator has to produce an annual report.

<a name="50622-17_para18"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Peston, would be good enough not to press his amendment, I shall certainly look into the matter in more detail. I propose to bring forward an appropriate government amendment to Schedule 3 to address the point. It would also provide an appropriate basis on which the progress of the pilot phases could be reported on by the director. With that undertaking, I hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment.

<A NAME="50622-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I warmly thank the noble Earl. As he knows, I have been feeling very rejected all afternoon and at last there has been a slight change.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para19"></a>I entirely accept the point about burdens which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. One of the reasons why I am delighted to be retiring in the next year as a professor is that when I started as an academic, you simply went and did your job, which was teaching young people and carrying out research. Now, academics mostly fill out forms and respond to the equivalent of regulators and people who want to write reports. I am glad to be getting away from that, although I have enjoyed my career. Therefore, I am not one who would seek to impose burdens unduly either on the firms or on the regulator. I am totally with the noble Lord on that point. He will find that I shall also be with him on other matters. I was not seeking to press the point for its own sake or because I want to see a few more trees chopped down to produce reports.
<P>

<a name="50622-17_para20"></a>In conclusion, I must say "Thank you very much" to the noble Earl. I look forward to seeing the form of his amendment and will undoubtedly welcome it when the time comes. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="50622-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am not sure that I like the word "ferret", but my reason for seeking to oppose the Question is to convince the Committee that I have worked very hard on this Bill. I have been working hard to try to understand it. Clause 4, however, is completely beyond me and what we call the "Notes on Clauses" shed no light at all. They seem merely to repeat the obscure and opaque wording of Clause 4.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para0"></a>I confess to the Committee that I have a further difficulty. I hope that it does not lower me in noble Lords' esteem. Clause 4 begins by stating:

<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   Perhaps I may assist the noble Lord. Section 6A was imported into the 1986 Act by the Gas (Exempt Supplies) Act 1993.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I congratulate the noble Lord. I did not understand a word that he just said because I did not even know of the existence of the 1993 Act. Is the noble Lord saying that what I call the 1986 Act is defective?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   The noble Lord raises an interesting point. No, I do not believe it to be defective. Due to the curious procedures of legislation, when an Act is amended it often assumes a form as if it had been written in that form to begin with. Perhaps I may explain a little further without wearying the Committee. There was a defect in the 1986 Act. It fell to me to introduce a Private Member's Bill in this House which subsequently amended the 1986 Act. That Act inserted into the 1986 Act Section 6A.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am indebted to the noble Lord. I understand that there is a Section 6A somewhere that one can find if one looks. However, that does not deal with my main point, which is that I do not understand a word of Clause 4. The clause is said to deal with exemptions from prohibition. First, as a practical matter, what does the clause deal with? What kinds of activities and what people may be exempt? Secondly, why is Clause 4 required to replace what I have not seen before? What is presently in the Act which requires this replacement? Have there been any exemptions in practice? The easiest way to understand what the clause is about is to have a practical example of how it has been used under the 1986 Act and how it may be used in this legislation. I raise the point because I have a duty as Opposition spokesman to scrutinise the Bill closely. I was tempted to let it go because I did not understand it. However, when one sees words like "Exemptions from prohibition" one needs a statement so that the ordinary ones among us can understand what the clause means. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Peston, in his remarks about the duties that he performs. As Opposition spokesman in this House, he performs them very well. I believe that what he has said applies to all of your Lordships who have duties as legislators.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para2"></a>I wish to comment on a rather odd procedure in Clause 4. As I understand it, Section 6A was inserted into the 1986 Act by another Act. This provision is now to be substituted for what was then inserted into the 1986 Act. No doubt it is an ingenious and convenient procedure, but it appears rather odd. Perhaps the Minister will comment on why it is done in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I confirm what my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter has just said about the noble Lord, Lord Peston. The noble Lord is carrying out the correct functions of the Opposition, which is to query, ferret and ask questions. I agree with my noble friend that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, does so in an exemplary fashion.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para3"></a>I was particularly grateful to my noble friend Lord Cochrane of Cults for interrupting the noble Lord, Lord Peston and telling us what the problem was. He knows <P>


<a name="column_464"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>all about this matter, because it was his Private Member's Bill that amended the Act and caused the noble Lord, Lord Peston, such confusion. I agree with my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter that in some respects it is not worded as clearly as the layman might wish. However, that is the way the parliamentary draftsman works.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para4"></a>I believe that the Committee has a useful opportunity to discuss exemption orders provided for in the clause. The purpose of the exemption provisions is to deal with what may loosely be called special cases where the licensing regime set out in other parts of the Bill is not appropriate or effective. Of the specific exemptions under scrutiny at the moment, one is a temporary exemption from the requirement for a supplier to have a shipper's licence where the shipper goes out of business pending the appointment of a new shipper. Gas supply to the customer has to be continued if that person goes out of business.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para5"></a>Another example is the operation of caravan parks. I hesitate to mention that for fear that my noble friend Lord Cochrane of Cults will interrupt me in the same way that he interrupted the noble Lord, Lord Peston. This clause affects the operation of caravan parks and similar premises where natural gas is distributed.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para6"></a>Another example is the operation of gas terminals. This was dealt with originally in Schedule 1. It will now be dealt with by exemption orders because of the complexity of the arrangements. A further example is the continued operation of dedicated pipelines where supply is undertaken pursuant to a licence under Section 8 of the existing legislation. A dedicated pipeline is one that goes from one place to another to supply a particular person.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para7"></a>It seems likely that a number of other special cases will arise where the exemption powers will have to be used. It is necessary for the clause to stand part of the Bill. Without it a number of firms would be unable to carry out their operations after the Bill is brought into force. In a number of cases it would not be possible to grant licences to regularise the business. I know that the purpose of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, was to find out the object of the clause.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para8"></a>I mentioned in replying to the debate on Second Reading that my department was considering the appropriate scope for exemption in respect of caravan parks. The matter is a technical one. Discussions continue to find the best balance between deregulation and ensuring that in appropriate cases customers are able to choose their gas suppliers. Final exemption will be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of this House and another place. There will be an opportunity to review what finally emerges.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked what exemptions had been made under the 1986 Act. I do not believe that as yet any have been made. The procedure provided for in that Act is the one that we have adopted in the Bill as it stands.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   The noble Earl said that the power had not been used at all. Therefore, the examples that have been given are hypothetical ones in order to elucidate the position. I am indebted to the noble Earl for giving those <P>


<a name="column_465"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 465</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>examples. At least I now understand what the clause is about. My intention was simply to seek elucidation. I hasten to say to the noble Lord, Lord Cochrane of Cults, that I have no intention of discussing caravan parks at this time or, if I have a free choice, at any other time. We shall come to that matter in due course.

<a name="50622-18_para10"></a>Clause 4 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para11"></a>Clause 5 [Licensing of public gas transporters]
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para12"></a>[Amendment No. 27 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara </B>   moved Amendment No. 27A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 5, line 42, at end insert:
<br>
("( ) No licence shall be granted under this section to a public gas transporter where, in the opinion of the Director, any director of that public gas transporter has a conflict of interest in the safe, efficient and economic operation of the regulated pipeline system.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-18_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: On behalf of my noble friend Lord Wade of Chorlton, I beg to move the amendment standing in his name on the Marshalled List. I should also like to speak to Amendment No. 55A. My noble friend apologises to the Committee for not being able to move the amendment himself.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para14"></a>In its report in 1993 the MMC recognised the problems that arose from the various activities of British Gas being wrapped up in one company. Accordingly, it recommended that BG's trading division be divested. My right honourable friend the President of the Board of Trade rejected that advice. I understand that his decision was probably based more on a desire to expedite the introduction of competition than outright rejection of the concept of divestment. Indeed, my right honourable friend and the regulator both confirmed that commercial separation must be implemented.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para15"></a>Under the new market conditions established by this Bill, British Gas will operate in three principal areas. First, it will be the operator of the pipeline system&#151;which is a natural monopoly business&#151;to be called British Gas TransCo. It will then be one of the suppliers competing for the 18 million domestic customers to whom it is at present the only supplier. I understand that that will bear the name British Gas PGS (Public Gas Supplier). Finally, it will continue to operate in the highly competitive international market place and in the worldwide exploration business where it is already a major player.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para16"></a>While British Gas proposes to place its PGS business&#151;the one that supplies our homes&#151;into a separate company, there is no such proposal for TransCo. In that case, rather than place it in a separate company BG has erected a system of Chinese walls. I suggest that that system of Chinese walls&#151;a device usually employed as a temporary measure&#151;is not a satisfactory way of proceeding for a number of reasons. First, they do not constitute a sufficient guarantee of a level playing field between BG and other PGS companies; secondly, they will provide insufficient transparency between BG business units; thirdly, they increase the risk of dispute on the fair allocation of costs, confidentiality of data and, ultimately, the terms under which other gas companies compete with BG trading units; fourthly, the opaque corporate structure <P>


<a name="column_466"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will provide Ofgas with much greater problems in its policing role; fifthly, they fail to address the political problems arising from the fact that within BG there will remain a substantial monopoly operation which will ensure that the row over executive remuneration could continue indefinitely; and, lastly, they fail to recognise that British Gas is effectively steward of the national asset, the pipeline system, and that the protection of the asset must be&#151;and be seen to be&#151;an absolute priority.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para17"></a>The most sensible solution to those problems would be that offered by my honourable friend Mr. Alan Duncan in another place. His amendment, which is in the same terms as Amendment No. 55A would have provided for TransCo to be a separate wholly owned subsidiary of British Gas, dedicated to the monopoly transportation business alone. Most unfortunately, that amendment did not find favour in another place.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para18"></a>These amendments, which I now commend to the Committee, would go a long way towards reassuring the nation that a key national asset was properly protected, and it would confer some valuable benefits in improving the competitive gas supply regime.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para19"></a>First, they would give the monopoly company and its directors unambiguous objectives, free from any conflict of interest. The pipeline operation is a natural monopoly. It is a massive UK infrastructure system, worth an estimated &#163;18 billion upon which the supply of gas to homes and factories throughout the land is dependent. Clearly, it requires directors who have a focused and clear fiduciary duty to protect, maintain and improve the regulated assets, and whose commitment to the safe maintenance and renewal of the system is not compromised in any way by conflicting loyalties to one of the supply companies.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para20"></a>The assets of TransCo need to be safeguarded. The public need to be reassured that the funds set aside for renewing the system, parts of which date back to Victorian times, will be there when required and not siphoned off to meet some more urgent cash demand in some other part of British Gas's business.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para21"></a>Secondly, these amendments would assist in the ring-fencing of the TransCo operation for the benefit of the regulator, Ofgas. The more clearly that TransCo is delineated as a separate operating company, the easier it will be to define the area of responsibility for Ofgas. I believe that in limiting the role of the regulator to that part of the business which is by nature a monopoly we would help the regulator to be clearly focused on the area of gas supply which is not subject to the disciplines of competition and where regulation has a clear role to play.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para22"></a>Thirdly, these amendments, particularly Amendment No. 55A, would allow clear external judgment to be made on the company's performance. Indeed, in the present climate it would deliver one very important benefit. The row about the pay of utility directors arises in part because there is a public perception that they are just running the same gas boards and electricity boards of old, but paying themselves 10 times as much. If the monopoly part of the business (where risks are inevitably less than in the competitive area) were ring-fenced there could be legitimate public scrutiny of the directors' pay leaving the level of executive pay of the risk-taking businesses entirely, and properly, a <P>


<a name="column_467"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter for the shareholders alone. Finally, they would provide a safeguard to ensure the permanent UK ownership and control of TransCo's monopoly assets.
<P>

<a name="50622-18_para23"></a>In conclusion, I wish to make it plain that there is no ulterior motive in these amendments to force British Gas against its will to divest itself of its key asset. I suspect that the company raises the spectre of divestment largely to frighten those who believe in the concept of national champions and do not want British Gas's status as one such damaged. Surely, though, there can be no danger to British Gas in applying to TransCo the same arrangements as it is applying to PGS. I believe these amendments do make a great deal of sense, and would not damage British Gas's prospects. I hope that they will find favour with my noble friend. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-18_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I oppose the amendments. Having listened to my noble friend, I understand that he is suggesting that TransCo be made a separate entity. I attended the all-party meeting we had with the chairman and chief executive of British Gas. I went to that meeting under the impression that it would be a good thing to have TransCo as an entirely separate company. I put that point at the meeting, and I was completely satisfied by the answer I received that it would not be a good thing. At the time I thought that it was parallel to the electricity national grid. I have followed the matter up since and found that it is not a parallel. Therefore I oppose the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara for speaking to the amendments on behalf of my noble friend Lord Wade. We too believe that the amendments are not necessary to ensure that TransCo is operated on a completely separate basis from British Gas's supply and shipping businesses. That is already provided for.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para0"></a>Rigorous procedural requirements are in place to ensure that completely separate and transparent accounts are produced for British Gas TransCo, its component businesses, and those parts of British Gas which provide services to both TransCo and to trading businesses. Those requirements are stricter than those applicable to a subsidiary company's statutory accounts.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para1"></a>There are very stringent safeguards in place within British Gas to ensure that there is no improper contact between the arms of British Gas's operations. There are also licence restrictions on cross-subsidy between TransCo and the BG trading businesses.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para2"></a>Those arrangements are intended to ensure that there is a level playing field&#151;I hope my noble friend Lord Ferrers will forgive me for using those words&#151;for shippers, including those connected to British Gas, supervised by Ofgas.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para3"></a>The arrangements have only recently been put in place (in February this year) and should be given a chance to work before being written off as insufficient. If they prove in practice not to be effective, there is a mechanism in place in the Bill to remedy that.
<P>


<a name="column_468"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para4"></a>The proposed new Section 36A of the Gas Act 1986 will give the director powers to make references to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission under the Fair Trading Act 1973. If, following a proper investigation of the matter, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that the rules had been put in place and were operating, or might be expected to operate, against the public interest, the commission could recommend divestment, a separate subsidiary, or whatever other remedy it thought appropriate.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para5"></a>We believe that it is right for a private company to be given a choice as to how to respond to the Bill's requirement for separate supply/shipping and transportation licence holders. I hope that explains the Government's position and give reassurance to my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-19_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I listened with care to what my noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara said, because, like my noble friend Lady Gardner, I was attracted originally to the idea of a separate company within British Gas or TransCo. I am sure that the Committee is agreed that British Gas should remain as owners and controllers of TransCo, not least because of the importance it gives to British Gas in its exploration and marketing overseas. That was something I mentioned on Second Reading, and believe to be of immense importance to UK Limited.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para6"></a>I listened to what my noble friend Lord Inglewood said in reply. I believe that he made out a convincing case for letting the situation evolve as it has been arranged at the moment. We are, after all, interfering with a private company, something of which I do not approve in principle, but having made that interference, it is right to let it decide which way matters should evolve.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para7"></a>A great deal of restructuring within British Gas has been done to make for the best possible separation, and, as my noble friend Lord Inglewood said, that has led to strict rules that will be heavily policed. Of course there is the fall back, and I hope that, given what was said, my noble friend Lord Brabazon will think that the Government and British Gas have it about right at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   I listened carefully to the debate which my noble friend's amendment engendered, and I am grateful to those who spoke in it. Obviously, my noble friend Lord Wade will wish to read what has been said. The amendment was intended only as a probing amendment to ascertain the views of Members of the Committee. I am sorry that Members opposite had nothing to say about it, but no doubt they have been thinking about it nevertheless. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-19_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Baroness Denton of Wakefield) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 8th June be approved.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the draft order authorises expenditure of &#163;3,437 million for Northern Ireland departments in the current financial year. This is in addition to the sum of &#163;2,705 million voted on account in March and brings total estimates provision for Northern Ireland departments to &#163;6,142 million, an increase of 4.4 per cent. on 1994-95. The order also authorises the use of additional receipts to meet an excess Vote in 1993-94.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para13"></a>I know that your Lordships continue to take a close interest in the prospects for economic development in Northern Ireland and I would like to say a few words about the local economic situation before turning to the contents of the Estimates. Both official data and survey evidence show a marked improvement in the recent performance of the Northern Ireland economy and future prospects are now looking very optimistic.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para14"></a>The output of manufacturing and production industries continues to rise at a rate above the national average. Over the past five years, Northern Ireland's manufacturing sector has increased output by 14.3 per cent. compared to a 0.1 per cent. rise nationally. Over a similar timescale there has been a significant improvement in the Province's gross domestic product relative to the United Kingdom figures. Over the period from 1991-92, compared to 1993-94, export sales from Northern Ireland grew by 24 per cent. significantly outperforming growth in exports in the UK of 18 per cent. The retail sector in Northern Ireland is booming. For example, Sainsbury is setting up shop in Northern Ireland for the first time with the planned opening of seven stores throughout the Province. In addition, a number of existing retail chain stores have announced expansion plans for Northern Ireland. These investments have the potential to create hundreds of jobs.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para15"></a>In the first five months of 1995 there were a total of 193,426 inquiries to tourist board offices in Northern Ireland, a splendid increase of 72.5 per cent. over the same period in 1994. There is a very favourable outlook for the tourism sector in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para16"></a>At March 1995 the seasonally adjusted number of employees in employment in the Province stood at 566,810, the best ever March figure. In addition, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent. is at its lowest level for 13 years.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para17"></a>All of this is very welcome news for the people of Northern Ireland and I am confident that the prospects and performance of the economy will continue to improve as the peace process becomes embedded. I continue to believe that the best cement for peace is jobs.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para18"></a>I now turn to the main items of expenditure covered by the order as detailed in the Estimates booklet. All the figures are of course in pounds sterling. I shall start with the Department of Agriculture. The net provision in the two agriculture Votes amounts to some &#163;155 million. In <P>


<a name="column_470"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Vote 1, some &#163;21 million is to fund EC and national agriculture and fishery support measures. In addition to various market support measures under the common agricultural policy, the Vote includes some &#163;6 million for grants for capital and other farm improvements and &#163;14 million is for the hill livestock compensatory allowance scheme.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para19"></a>Vote 2 includes &#163;133 million for regional services and support measures. This includes &#163;60 million for agri-food development and for scientific and veterinary services; &#163;38 million for farm support, environmental areas, fisheries and forestry services; and &#163;5 million for the rural development programme.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para20"></a>In the Department of Economic Development's Vote 1, some &#163;135 million is for the Industrial Development Board. Against a background of peace the board will increase its activities to attract firms to set up and expand in Northern Ireland. The board has set itself a target of securing 20 inward investment projects involving some 4,500 jobs during the current year.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para21"></a>In Vote 2, &#163;33 million is for the local enterprise development unit and &#163;16 million is for the industrial research and technology unit. Elsewhere in the Vote, &#163;13.6 million is for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para22"></a>In Vote 3, &#163;203 million is for the Training and Employment Agency. This includes &#163;77 million for the new jobskills training programme and &#163;55 million for the action for community employment programme, which includes &#163;1.3 million for the community work programme pilot. Eighteen million pounds is to assist companies improve their competitiveness through structured training and development of their workforce and by providing future managers with the skills and experience they require to succeed.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para23"></a>I now turn to the Estimates for the Department of the Environment, where &#163;180 million in Vote 1 is for roads, transport and ports. This includes some &#163;150 million for the development, operation and maintenance of Northern Ireland's public road system.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para24"></a>Vote 2 covers the important area of housing. Some &#163;203 million will provide assistance mainly to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and to the voluntary housing movement. When net borrowing and the Housing Executive's rents and capital receipts are taken into account the total resources available for housing will be some &#163;593 million. This is &#163;20 million more than in 1994-95 and will enable us to build on the progress which has been made in recent years.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para25"></a>In Vote 3, gross expenditure on water and sewerage services is estimated at &#163;202 million. Ninety-four million pounds is for capital expenditure and some &#163;108 million is for operational and maintenance purposes.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para26"></a>In Vote 4, &#163;142 million is for environmental services, including some &#163;35 million for urban regeneration measures. These continue to be targeted at areas of social, economic and environmental need and have helped secure a welcome improvement to many areas of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para27"></a>The Estimates for the Department of Education seek a total of &#163;1,380 million, an increase of 4.3 per cent. over last year. Vote 1 includes &#163;842 million for recurrent expenditure by education and library boards, an increase <P>


<a name="column_471"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of &#163;39 million over 1994-95. This includes &#163;794 million for schools and colleges of further education and will help maintain the pupil/teacher ratio at present levels. Also included is some &#163;48 million for libraries, youth services and administration, and &#163;41 million for boards' capital projects. One hundred and forty-three million pounds is for voluntary schools and some &#163;15 million is for integrated schools. There are now 23 integrated schools in operation with over 4,700 pupils in attendance. Approval has been given for four further integrated schools from September 1995, with another one in the pipeline.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para28"></a>Vote 2 includes &#163;119 million for universities, &#163;124 million for student support, &#163;16 million for arts and museums and &#163;3 million for community relations.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para29"></a>In the Department of Health and Social Services, Vote 1 includes &#163;1,380 million for expenditure on hospital, community health, personal social services, health and social services trusts and family health services. That is an increase of 5.6 per cent. on last year.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para30"></a>In Vote 3 gross provision of some &#163;224 million is for the department's administration and other costs. That includes &#163;122 million for the Social Security Agency, &#163;19 million for the Child Support Agency and &#163;13 million for the Health and Personal Social Services Management Executive.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para31"></a>In Vote 4 &#163;1,463 million is for a range of social security benefits, an increase of 5.8 per cent. on last year. In Vote 5, &#163;406 million is to cover expenditure on the independent living funds, housing benefit, the Social Fund and payments to the National Insurance fund.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para32"></a>Finally, I turn to the Department of Finance and Personnel. Within Votes 1 and 3, some &#163;5.6 million is for the community relations programme. Taken together with the expenditure by the Department of Education, total spending on the community relations programme will be some &#163;8.7 million and reflects the importance which government continue to attach to that area.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para33"></a>I hope that that short summary of the main components of the Estimates is helpful to your Lordships. This is a very special time in Northern Ireland. We need to build on the opportunities that the new climate brings to us and ensure that the benefits of the ceasefires are shared by everyone in the community. I commend the order to your Lordships.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cooke of Islandreagh: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the Minister's presentation of the order. Indeed, I enjoyed hearing the good news that she was able to give us about the economy. I work in manufacturing industry in Northern Ireland and I can support everything that the Minister said. The economy is in good shape; it is trying very hard; and I am sure that it will do even better.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para35"></a>However, I wonder whether the Minister declared her interest. I say that because the noble Baroness is the Minister for the economy and also the Minister for agriculture. Those are two very big jobs. I do not know how she manages them both; but I can tell your Lordships <P>


<a name="column_472"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that she does, and very well too. I am quite certain that any questions that I ask tonight will not add to her workload, which is something that I would not wish to do. There are so many items in the public expenditure between the different departments that one could talk about them and discuss them all night, but in the short time at my disposal I shall just speak about a few of them.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para36"></a>I do not believe that the Minister mentioned this, but, in addition to the funds allocated, I understand that funds have recently been redirected from the security forces as a result of the ceasefire. That is very welcome and I hope that that reduction in security costs can be carried out carefully and sensibly so as not to cause undue hardship to those who have given so much to the service over many years. I understand that about &#163;50 million will be released this year and &#163;60 million next year. That additional money will be very welcome and will be used to assist health, education, housing and roads.

<a name="50622-19_para37"></a>In Northern Ireland we have long been fortunate in having an excellent health service with very high standards, but there is a widespread feeling that the cost and complexity of administration is getting out of hand and that it is getting worse rather than better. The cost of administration above hospital level has recently been estimated at &#163;80 million, which seems quite an absurd amount for the Province with 1.6 million people.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para38"></a>I believe that the health service administration needs a radical examination and that whole layers of administration could be cut out. That review should be carried out by an independent outside consultant. I believe that the Minister conducted an internal review about 18 months ago, but much more than that is required. Just as an example, perhaps I may point out that it is almost impossible to get decisions on policy matters. However, I must temper that by saying that the recent decision to undertake modernisation of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast is very welcome and, indeed, essential.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para39"></a>In education there is urgent need for money to repair and renovate school buildings, some of which are in a very bad state of repair. On the other hand, there are regular reports on the move to develop a university on the Springvale site in west Belfast. Perhaps the pressure comes from academics who wish to extend their empires. However, it would be very costly and I wonder whether it would be worth while. Quite apart from the cost, I cannot believe that a university would be right for west Belfast where the educational and training needs are at a lower level. There is great need in that area for vocational and technical training, perhaps extending at the top level to polytech but not university standard. I hope that good sense will prevail.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para40"></a>So far there has been no peace dividend for the construction industry in Northern Ireland. There is less work in hand than there has been for years. There has been a serious and substantial drop in output, activity and employment. The matter has been referred to in another place in recent months.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para41"></a>Investment in construction is a very cost-efficient method of creating jobs. At this particular point in the peace process, job creation is vitally important. I understand that there are many projects ready to go ahead but that there has been no money for them. Can the Minister now identify the major public sector <P>

<a name="50622-19_para42"></a>Roads have been a matter for concern because the general road system, especially the second class roads, is deteriorating. I hope that the money that is being allocated tonight will be sufficient to improve the maintenance.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para43"></a>The Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland works hard. It gives an excellent service to the farming and food industry and, in general, its work is to be commended. However, I must mention the Sub Programme for Agricultural and Rural Development, known as SPARD. That scheme offers a rate of grant of 30 per cent. payable for capital items on the farm designed to improve competitiveness and to enhance the environment. It also includes expenditure to combat pollution. The scheme, with 70 per cent. paid by the landowner, is a highly efficient mechanism to channel resources into localised jobs. The money will be spent on new buildings, culverts, concrete structures, fencing and restoration. These are high labour content items which will create or underpin localised jobs and, therefore, rural prosperity. As a form of peace dividend for farmers, it is hard to imagine anything better.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para44"></a>The scheme was open for applications in November 1994, but was suspended on 24th March this year when a total of 11,000 applications had been received. It was closed because the department had insufficient funds to meet many of those applications. I understand the budget for the SPARD project is &#163;8.5 million this year, with &#163;10 million in subsequent years. Schemes of this sort are time-sensitive as farmers must have the will and the cash available. They may have the will and the cash now, but next year things may have changed and they could either not have the will or the money. In view of the reallocation of funds presently being made, surely the extra few million pounds required could be found to support this excellent scheme for rural employment and rural development.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para45"></a>The Northern Ireland fishing fleet is in difficulties. In common with fishing fleets elsewhere in the UK, the quotas have been reduced. The white fish quota has been reduced for the Northern Ireland fleet and pressure is now on prawns because white fish trawlers have moved across to prawns and in order to be economic they are using two nets. Unfortunately that puts the traditional prawn boats, which only use one net, at a disadvantage. Prawn prices have recently been low due to heavy landings and some owners of prawn trawlers want to get out. There is a belief that the next tranche of decommissioning will exclude prawn trawlers. As the whole object of decommissioning is to reduce the size of our fleets, surely the prawn boat owners should also have the opportunity to get out if they wish.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para46"></a>The cost of electricity is causing great concern in Northern Ireland. It is perhaps the biggest cloud on our horizon, both on the domestic and the industrial fronts. For domestic users the cost of electricity is presently about 19 per cent. above the GB average. That difference will widen when the 8 per cent. levy is removed in Great Britain. By the end of next year Northern Ireland could be at a 30 per cent. disadvantage compared with GB householders. Those figures were given in evidence to the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Northern Ireland special affairs committee in another place by the chairman of the Northern Ireland consumer committee for electricity.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para47"></a>For industrial users it is more difficult to generalise because of the many different tariffs and forms of contract, but comparisons have been made between plants in Northern Ireland and almost exactly similar plants in Great Britain. When assistance from the trust fund ceases at the end of this year the difference will vary from 15 per cent. to 30 per cent. and that will get worse because the use of systems charges will increase by inflation plus 3.5 per cent. In Great Britain they increase by inflation less 2 per cent. This means that in five or six years the 30 per cent. difference will be increased to about 50 per cent. greater cost in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para48"></a>The main reason for the higher cost in Northern Ireland is because the contracts for purchase of the generating stations guarantee payment of all costs plus profit except fuel against making plant available. Most of these contracts extend until the year 2010. The consequence of this is that no new generator, however efficient, will reduce unit costs because the fixed costs of the present generators have to be paid even if no power is taken. An additional reason is that flue treatment costs, which in Great Britain are borne by the generators, are to be paid for by the consumer in Northern Ireland. Next year Ballylumford will convert to gas and, later, desulphurisation equipment will be fitted at Kilroot. Large sums are involved, probably in excess of &#163;100 million, all of which will add to the cost of a unit of electricity. The consequence of these matters, plus the need to offer a high rate of return in the shares of NIE, has resulted in the profit formula for Northern Ireland Electricity being much more generous than for other regional electricity companies in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para49"></a>The Office of Electricity Regulation has a duty to promote competition in generation and supply and to protect the interests of consumers. Although competition is theoretically possible in 1996, the director general himself has admitted that this will have no material effect on prices until well into the next century. The regulator has power to review the distribution charges levied by Northern Ireland Electricity which at present are permitted to increase by inflation plus 3.5 per cent. If he could instead reduce them by one and a half times inflation each and every year, it would barely stabilise prices. This is because the generating costs which represent 60 per cent. of the total charges are fixed by contract which the regulator has no power to change. In short the director general cannot do his job; he cannot protect the interests of consumers.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para50"></a>The declared objective of privatisation was to improve efficiency, improve competition and reduce the cost to the consumer. Unfortunately the way the service has been privatised has resulted in increasing the cost to the consumer. Efficiency gains have been made by the generators but the fixed form of contract means that efficiency gains are not passed on to the consumer. Domestic users and industry are faced with ever higher costs of electricity compared with those on the mainland and most of this is unfortunately a direct result of government approved contracts.

<a name="50622-19_para51"></a>The steadily increasing costs of electricity compared with those in Great Britain will seriously affect householders, existing industry and its competitiveness, and the decision of companies thinking of coming to Northern Ireland. Large sums of money will be involved. I have not been able to calculate that, but I know that &#163;100 million would not go far to meet this adverse difference. This important matter is presently being investigated by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in another place. I have no doubt that its findings will be in line with what I have described. I will not press the Minister for an answer to this whole situation this evening because it does not appear that the Government have yet faced the facts or have considered what should be done about this serious handicap to industry. I sincerely hope that some straight thinking and appropriate action will develop in the next few months.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para52"></a>When speaking of spending perhaps I may refer to grants which will be made to Northern Ireland by the European Union under the terms of the European initiative for peace and reconciliation. I hope that some of that money will be spent in Northern Ireland. I believe that some community groups are coming together with the intention of managing this expenditure on behalf of the European Union. Is that the proper way, I wonder, to manage such funds? Should not local councils be involved? After all, we want and need to build up the democratic process in Northern Ireland. I have taken rather a long time but there were many matters to cover and there were many more that I would like to have covered. However, the House will be spared that.

<A NAME="50622-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her clear explanation of today's order. The context of our debate is one of ceasefires continuing through the marching season, and despite various difficulties. The ending of shootings and explosions has enabled people to enjoy normal life, sometimes for the first time. It is encouraging tourism and investment and we very much welcome the economic improvements which the noble Baroness mentioned earlier.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para53"></a>I am glad to say there has also been an increase in dialogue between the two main traditions. I particularly welcome moves towards proportionality and power sharing within Belfast City Council and I hope that these will make further progress.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para54"></a>One of the main obstacles to real peace is the continuance of intimidation and punishment beatings, all of which were much mentioned in the earlier debate in your Lordships' House on emergency legislation. My hope is that the paramilitaries and related parties will sit down and discuss the details of future policing within so-called hard-line areas. Those groups may have many useful ideas to contribute and I feel that such a move would be a major confidence-building measure in itself.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para55"></a>So far, there does not seem to be much progress towards the start of negotiations for an overall political settlement. The issues are complex and we must be patient. However, no task is more urgent than to find an acceptable replacement for direct rule and a means for <P>


<a name="column_476"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 476</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dispensing with emergency law and special courts. Equally important is the search for ways in which the whole society in Northern Ireland may become demilitarised. Those processes can be assisted powerfully by many different ideas and groups. I trust that there will be maximum consultation and participation by the public.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para56"></a>My friend Mr. David Bleakley, who has relevant experience as a trade unionist, former Minister for community relations and general secretary of the Irish Council of Churches, in a recently published book called for a movement proclaiming "Ulster says yes". By that he meant yes to consent; yes to constructive negotiations; and yes to conflict resolution. I trust that there will be a groundswell of public opinion in such a positive direction.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para57"></a>At the same time, it is necessary to appreciate the cultural differences which distinguish the Protestant and Catholic approaches to serious problems. By and large, Protestants like to advance step by step and case by case, respecting individual conscience. On the other hand, Catholics often prefer to proceed from the general to the particular. They tend to go for the framework first before filling in the details. Those mental and cultural differences are important and we need to remember that the majority of the population has a Protestant background.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para58"></a>Earlier this year&#151;I think it was in January&#151;I suggested to the Secretary of State that an interim elected assembly might be a useful and helpful measure in view of the likely length of the main trilateral negotiations. Such an assembly could be partly directly elected and partly chosen from party lists. In that way, new talent could be drawn in both for consultation and so that new entrants might gain political and administrative experience. I very much hope that that idea will not be discarded entirely. Some kind of transitional period is likely to be necessary in any event between full direct rule and any new agreed system. An assembly could help to bridge that gap.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para59"></a>It is for consideration whether an independent truth commission could be helpful, particularly in disentangling various disputed and unresolved injuries and deaths which still cause much anguish. There is, of course, a South African parallel for such an inquiry.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para60"></a>The release of prisoners whose offences have been largely politically motivated is another important and difficult matter. As president of NIACRO, I say only that I believe that the research published recently by that organisation into the procedures adopted by other countries which have experienced serious internal conflict has been an aid to serious discussion of the issues involved.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para61"></a>Speaking personally, I urge the Government to remove the anomaly whereby those sentenced since March 1989 have a lower rate of remission compared with those sentenced before that date. I would counsel against the premature release of Private Clegg and I should like to emphasise that all releases should be accompanied by measures which recognise the sufferings of victims of violence and which show that those sufferings have not been in vain.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para62"></a>I conclude by stating that ceasefires and the search for political solutions pose a real challenge to the Churches, in particular in Northern Ireland. We all know that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>relationships at the level of archbishops, cardinals and moderators are good and friendly. But I ask whether those friendships are being translated into the breaking down of long-standing barriers at parish and local community level. Is the present moment seen as an opportunity for new kinds of dialogue and local co-operation? For many years now voluntary ecumenical groups, of which PACE, Corrymeela, Cornerstone and Rostrevor are perhaps the best known, have shown how people of different traditions can live and work together for common purposes. I wonder whether that experience has been analysed and digested fully. Will it now be applied at all levels of the traditional church structures? I trust that those structures will, from now on, become components and active builders of the solution which is so greatly desired.

<A NAME="50622-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   My Lords, I wish to speak on one or two subjects that have already been mentioned by the noble Baroness. I was in Belfast recently and I had discussions with various groups. They were all impressing upon me the importance of community relations organisations in Northern Ireland because throughout the past number of years they have been indispensable in trying to create the atmosphere in which the ceasefire has eventually arrived. Whatever increase there may have been in expenditure, that has been money well spent. From what I have heard, and what I know prior to my arrival in this House, since its inception, the Community Relations Council has carried out remarkable work in a very dangerous atmosphere.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para63"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned Sainsbury's. I am sure that she is aware of the debate which took place yesterday evening at the other end of this building. Everyone in Northern Ireland welcomes investment there. We are only too well aware that with the ceasefire in operation we may be more hopeful of attracting more investment.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para64"></a>The announcement that Sainsbury's is set to open seven or possibly 12 stores is to be welcomed throughout Northern Ireland. But the way in which the announcement was made has caused some controversy. There are stores in Northern Ireland which have operated in very difficult circumstances for the past 25 years. Many of those stores have been blown up repeatedly and put out of business and it has taken a great deal of courage to start them up again.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para65"></a>Many of those have made applications in relation to certain sites in order to expand their businesses and were told by the planning authorities that those sites were unsuitable; that they were for recreational purposes; and that they were not to be used for the beginnings of a retail business. An announcement is then made by the Sainsbury organisation that it is to open its retail outlets on the very sites for which planning permission had been refused to local retailers. Naturally that has caused great concern. Deputations were here yesterday and today and I questioned them very closely. I certainly told them that I would not be party to trying to prevent inward investment. But they say that they simply ask that if planning permission is to be given to a retailer, it should be given whether such investment be home based or inward investment.
<P>


<a name="column_478"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 478</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para66"></a>The Sainsbury organisation has not been in Northern Ireland during the past 25 years. I do not believe that it would ask for any great favours. I reinforce what has been said by elected representatives on the other side who are much more closely involved with the people in Northern Ireland and with that problem: that no undue or privileged treatment be given to organisations in order to set up retail outlets in Northern Ireland to the disadvantage of those who have been in Northern Ireland and have made applications on planning over numbers of years. There should be a level playing field for everyone.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para67"></a>I realise that the issue is not, strictly speaking, a matter for the noble Baroness. Some would say that it is for the Department of the Environment. However, one cannot isolate the environment from the whole economic approach or atmosphere in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para68"></a>I urge the noble Baroness to take account of what was said at the other end of the building. All that the home bred retailers want is a fair allocation of planning permissions when those are necessary to open up such outlets.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   My Lords, it is always a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. Perhaps I may refer to the Sainsbury's investment. It is obviously extremely welcome. It is a symbol of the greater peace and tranquillity that now obtains in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para69"></a>Perhaps I may add to the warning that the noble Lord gave. As the noble Baroness will be aware, at the very moment that her colleague the Secretary of State for the Environment seeks to ensure that not all supermarket development is out of town and to recreate a sense of community by making sure that the high streets are revived, it would be a shame if the whole of the Sainsbury's investment in Northern Ireland went into large, new shopping centres out of town and did not contribute to what is most needed&#151;the re-creation of many run-down urban areas.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para70"></a>On the larger issues which the noble Baroness so ably presented, I was pleased that she began with the larger macroeconomic situation in Northern Ireland because there is much good news, and it is right to emphasise it. Potentially there is a virtuous circle of good news leading to further investment leading to greater confidence and greater economic activity.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para71"></a>However, although the figures for unemployment in Northern Ireland have dropped by 10,000 in the past 12 months, we should remember that they still stand at 88,700. As a proportion of population in the United Kingdom, it is the worst figure. I know that the noble Baroness will share our concern that within that figure 57 per cent. of claimants of unemployment benefit in Northern Ireland have been unemployed for more than one year. In other words, they are long-term unemployed. Of those, one in five have been unemployed for over five years. In fact, if one considers Northern Ireland as a whole, one in five of Northern Ireland households claims social security benefit compared with about one in eight in the United Kingdom as a whole.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para72"></a>There are no grounds whatever for complacency. I do not imply that that is the case as regards the Government. The question is this. What can we do to achieve better <P>


<a name="column_479"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 479</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>organic growth, not just to ensure that the inward flow of investment continues as a spin off of the ceasefire? How can we create significantly extra economic activity in Northern Ireland? For instance, so long as we discuss these appropriation orders in this House&#151;and before long may they be discussed in a devolved power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland&#151;it would be wonderful to see a reverse in the trend in unemployment so that a greater percentage of the appropriation could then go on trade, industry, training and infrastructure, and less on social security.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para73"></a>It is worth recording that social security accounts for 32.5 per cent. of the total appropriation that we are considering. The situation is not getting better. In 1987-88 the figure was 31 per cent. If anything, the position is slightly worse. The subsidy, the subvention that every household in mainland Great Britain gives to Northern Ireland goes to social security to an enormous extent.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para74"></a>I very much support the Action for Community Employment Scheme. It has produced a reduction in unemployment. However, I was curious that in Vote 2 on page 4 there is a reduction in funding for training programmes, management and enterprise education. I should have thought that a skilled workforce has never been more crucial. When the noble Baroness responds, I should be grateful if she will tell us why the total estimate budget of the IBD&#151;which has doubled its own job creation target to 4,500 in 1995-96&#151;is being cut from &#163;149 million to &#163;134.5 million?
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para75"></a>As regards the relative attractiveness of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for investment, I shall be interested in the noble Baroness's comments on this matter. In this new, improved atmosphere, in some ways Northern Ireland is in danger of losing out to the Republic of Ireland as regards inward investment. Just this month Northern Ireland lost 1,500 jobs to the republic. The sum of &#163;21 million was invested by Seagate Technology in Tipperary, rather than in Derry, as expected, where the company already employs 350 people. Between 1980 and 1993, the republic gained an extraordinary achievement: 100,000 manufacturing jobs. That is 10 times the number that we have created in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para76"></a>At present the Republic of Ireland, which has by any measure a small population, is attracting 23 per cent. of all new American investment into Europe. People have stated that one of the reasons for that differential attraction is taxation. Corporation tax for Northern Ireland is 33 per cent. for companies with taxable profits of more than &#163;1.5 million. As we know, the republic has a super competitive rate of 10 per cent. It is not an easy problem to solve. I do not have an easy solution. However, I am most interested to hear the Minister's comments because it would be a great tragedy if, in the United States, Japan, Korea and in other parts of the world where the good news about peace in Ireland is being heard, investment heads only towards the south.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para77"></a>That brings me to the question of what strategy there is to co-ordinate decision-making between government departments regarding development of business opportunities with the republic. The noble Baroness may recall that when we discussed the appropriation order in March, on these Benches we suggested that there might <P>


<a name="column_480"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be more North-South co-operation on telecommunication and tourism. I am delighted to see that there is a pilot scheme for concessionary telecommunication tariffs now planned between Dublin and Belfast. I am delighted too, by the six new joint marketing projects between the board in the republic and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para78"></a>Perhaps I may ask the noble Baroness a question on roads. She referred to the vast increase of tourism coming to Northern Ireland. It is exciting. When developing the infrastructure is so vital for both inward investment, economic development and tourism, I wonder why the estimates for expenditure on roads and transport services are down from &#163;189 million to &#163;180 million. That comes at a time when freight traffic on Northern Ireland roads is growing by 7 per cent. per annum as a result of the activity that she described. On the Belfast-Dublin route, it is growing by 20 per cent. a year&#151;and high time too. There is an overall road maintenance backlog of &#163;58 million, and many of the major thoroughfares in Northern Ireland date from the 1960s, as we all know.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para79"></a>The noble Baroness will not be surprised to hear that I should like to raise briefly the question of integrated education. There is no mention of integrated education in the order. That is not of itself surprising, but there has been no other indication from the department about how much planned expenditure there will be in that area. Yet in February this year, the Minister's colleague, the right honourable Michael Ancram, said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Integrated education has an important role to play in creating better understanding and tolerance in Northern Ireland".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para80"></a>I find the Government's reticence on funding a bit of a problem, given that there is still less than 2 per cent. of the school population at integrated schools.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para81"></a>I very much enjoyed the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Cooke. Incidentally, I agree with what the noble Lord said about electricity prices in Northern Ireland. At a time when the profitability of Northern Ireland Electricity has gone up by 15 per cent., it does not seem that consumers and industry there are getting a particularly good deal. I did not agree with the noble Lord on the matter of the Springvale peace line campus. Potentially, it is a very imaginative concept. As has been the case at Coleraine, it could represent a tremendous impetus for local employment. The effect of the Coleraine campus, with a student population of 4,500 is that it has generated over 1,000 jobs on campus, 900 of them full-time. Wellworths, the food and clothes retailer said that, if there is a Springvale campus, it will create 120 jobs in a new West Belfast supermarket. Given that Northern Ireland has a need for more student places at the tertiary level, it would be an imaginative concept to go ahead with Springvale. Although the capital cost is considerable, it has been estimated that the annual running cost would be of the order of some &#163;6 million a year to the Northern Ireland Department of Education. When the noble Baroness and I last addressed this subject across the Floor of the House, I believe she expected her right honourable friend to reach some sort of conclusion by the end of April. We have still heard nothing, and it is now nearly the end of June. It would be most interesting to hear the Government's thinking on that issue.

<a name="50622-19_para82"></a>Reference was made by the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, and by the Minister in her opening remarks, to community programmes. I was delighted to see the increase in allocation to community programmes. The importance of community work, both in the run-up to the ceasefire and now in cementing and building the peace, cannot be over-estimated. There are great social problems in Northern Ireland. Many are results of the long years of savage tension. For instance, levels of sickness in West Belfast are at their worst for 25 years. There is unemployment of 40 per cent. on the Shankill and Falls Roads. Anything that helps community work is welcome. We on these Benches very much welcome the Interface Project of the Community Relations Council, which involves work with communities on the peace lines.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para83"></a>Finally, will the Minister confirm that the Government agree with Jacques Santer's comment in relation to the &#163;240 million peace package; namely, that European funds are 100 per cent. additional: the UK and Irish funds should be additional as well? It would be very good to receive that confirmation.

<A NAME="50622-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   My Lords, I very much regret that my noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn is unavoidably absent. Needless to say, I thank the Minister very much for explaining with her usual clarity the terms of this order and for drawing attention to its main components.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para84"></a>Perhaps I may begin by referring to a recent visit that I made as a member of Committee D of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body to the city of Londonderry&#151;or, to express a different culture, Derry. It was some years since I had last been to that proud city. Speaking to people in the great Guildhall and to eager teachers and students, I had the clear impression that thinking was on the move and that positive and hopeful efforts were being made to work together to encourage community development at grass roots level.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para85"></a>Clearly, the ceasefire has opened up an opportunity to take a fundamental look at the problems of the Province and the policies and programmes that are being implemented to address them. As the Minister and other noble Lords know well, this has been a theme of a number of valuable conferences on Northern Ireland during the past six months.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para86"></a>Unemployment is one of the two main elements at the heart of the problem. Therefore, reducing unemployment must also be at the heart of the solution. On this, I agree with other speakers this evening: the Minister was most encouraging. A week ago the noble Baroness announced the unemployment figures for May. They show that unemployment fell for the eleventh consecutive month. I follow the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Holme, about hardcore unemployment, and I touch upon that. I thought that the most encouraging part of the Minister's statement was her confirmation that the number of long-term unemployed&#151;those out of work for more than a year&#151;was falling, albeit only by a very small reduction. I fully share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Holme, about long-term unemployment. Does the Minister have any firm grounds for believing that the hardcore long-term unemployed can be halved by the year 2000? After all, we want opportunities for all, and in both communities.
<P>

<P>

<a name="50622-19_para87"></a>In her press statement, repeated this evening, on the May unemployment figures, the Minister warned against the temptation of complacency and called on Northern Ireland to redouble its efforts. A week ago in Paris she spoke of the need for the Province "to aim high". I am all for optimism. Can the Minister be a little more specific about those aims? What are the detailed aims of policy over the next five years or so; and what are the timescales for achieving those objectives? Will she also indicate the provisions in the draft order that are geared in particular to achieving those aims? It was Sir George Quigley, the chief executive of Ulster Bank and chairman of the Economic Council, who recently said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I would like to see us indicate what we want to achieve by the year 2000, since it may help to prevent our becoming the prisoners of past policy assumptions".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para88"></a>Those words are the source of my question.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para89"></a>It needs no words from these Benches to remind the House that Northern Ireland is on the westernmost limit of the British Isles and at the farthest point from the industrial and business centres of the European Union. Obviously, that does not come without its disadvantages. Of course, looking at it the other way round, Northern Ireland is on the doorstep of the Union. But it has been said that the doorstep can be very draughty. We therefore welcome very much those European initiatives that have been specially designed to meet some of the conditions that are unique to Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para90"></a>As I understand the case of the Institute of Directors (and I may have misunderstood it), there may be some grounds for concern about the loans structure of the European Investment Bank. We have had experience in Wales of the European Investment Bank. I believe that the Institute of Directors was referring to the interest subsidies and loan guarantees structure of the bank. Can the Minister say whether there is anything in that complaint? Is this matter being explored by her department? Will she also comment as to whether more could be done in this direction by the Northern Ireland financial institutions themselves?
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para91"></a>The Minister attended the important Washington Conference on Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland. Is her department in a position by now to make a preliminary judgment about the success of that conference? How successful will it be in attracting innovative American firms to the Province, in addition to the 20 inward investment projects to which she referred in her opening speech?
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para92"></a>In an article published in the Belfast Telegraph on 23rd May, the eve of the Washington conference, the noble Baroness listed the benefits which Northern Ireland offered to American firms. In the list there appeared "our education". There are two uncomfortable questions that I want to raise about education. It has been known for a long time that far too many young people in Northern Ireland leave school poorly equipped with vocational skills. This was roughly touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, as I understood him. The Department of Education has for many years been in trouble over this failure. Some of us are, I fear, puzzled by the inability of the department to tackle the problem effectively.
<P>


<a name="column_483"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para93"></a>That leads me to the second issue. If, as we expect and earnestly hope, the ceasefire leads to a lasting peace, we understand that some 12,000 people now employed in the security services will become redundant during the next few years and up to 1,000 prisoners will be released. A very high percentage of those people will require retraining. Is there not a great risk that retraining facilities will not be there? What will be the result if they are not in place? Perhaps the Minister can meet some of our concerns by identifying those provisions in the order which are commensurate with those needs.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para94"></a>I am sure that the Northern Ireland Ministers are fully conscious of those problems. All the same, I wish to place on the record that there is a growing conviction in Northern Ireland&#151;it is not confined to the well documented concerns of the leaders of the Church of Ireland, the Methodists, the Presbyterians and of the Defenders of the South Eastern Education Board&#151;that there may be deep-rooted problems of management within the Department of Education and that public confidence in it is less than it used to be. In fact, that is reinforced to some degree by the need for the department to obtain authority, in the first item of this order, for the excess Vote of 1993-94. The first item stands in splendid isolation in Part I of Schedule 1. Unless I missed the Minister's words, we did not receive a word of explanation for that item.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para95"></a>The explanation given by the department is that that calculation, which is in excess of &#163;1,000, arose out of a miscalculation "prepared by inexperienced staff". Again, that is an indication that all may not be well in that department.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para96"></a>Perhaps I may also venture to refer to the management of one part of the Minister's own department: the Department of Economic Development. Clearly, not a word of criticism is levelled at the noble Baroness, Lady Denton. I have a feeling that if she had been in her post at the time, the concerns would not have arisen at all.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para97"></a>Noble Lords will recall that in both Houses of Parliament there was united and strong opposition to the privatisation of the Northern Ireland electricity industry. Yet, at all times, the Department of Economic Development was deaf and blind to all the arguments.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para98"></a>However, now we have before us the report of the Public Accounts Committee on the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity. It is very interesting to re-read the debates on the privatisation of the electricity industry in the light of the contents of that report. It came as news to me that it was the department's assessment from the outset that major benefits were unlikely to become available for a considerable period of time. It was also news that there had not been a proper valuation of the generating stations and that one of the department's own advisers&#151;a well-paid adviser&#151;in the sale of the generating stations, oddly, was also providing advice to one of the companies tendering for the generating stations. That names but three of the 10 mischiefs that are highlighted in the report. Clearly, the report raises many doubts about the management of one part of the department during the relevant period.
<P>


<a name="column_484"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 484</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para99"></a>I come to the central issue of the cost of electricity for the Northern Ireland consumer. It remains too high. It is, as usual, significantly higher than for the consumer in parts of the mainland. I should like to ask a question of the Minister that has not been asked this evening. Will she be good enough to confirm that I have correctly understood, from evidence that she gave to the Northern Ireland Select Committee a day or two ago, that the Government have now decided in principle that they will subsidise the costs of generating electricity in Northern Ireland under specified conditions? If I have that right, can she give details of the arrangement and of the specified conditions?
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para100"></a>We are also aware that the leaders of the voluntary and community organisations&#151;chief among them the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action, the Co-operative Movement and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&#151;are pressing for greater partnership between the private sector, the public sector and the voluntary agencies. It is important that their role is fully recognised and supported by the Government.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para101"></a>Action on the reduction of social inequality, action to close the gap between the haves and the have-nots within both communities and the promotion of co-operation is, in the opinion of many people, of equal importance to the creation of jobs. I may mention that that is a specific area of anxiety to my noble friend Lord Blease of Cromac, who has always been concerned for both communities. That concern always showed in his contributions, which we have greatly missed in these debates over the past year or so.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para102"></a>Mentioning the noble Lord, Lord Blease, leads me naturally to my next point; namely, the profound concern of the Council for the Homeless that the problem of homelessness is worsening in Northern Ireland. Its fear is that future plans will inevitably worsen the position. I must say to the Minister that, if the report is reliable, the position seems to me to be extremely unsatisfactory. Up to now there has not been a word in the speech about the homeless. However, I accept that the Minister was principally concerned with explaining the framework of the document. Given the words of that charity, one wonders how much further down the existing road this Government think it fitting to go. I urge the Government to reconsider their strategy.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para103"></a>I return to the visits which the noble Baroness, Lady Denton, has paid to the city of Londonderry during the past six months or so in connection with the expansion of the Foyle Fisheries Commission. That is a long-standing cross-border institution. I noticed that the Republic of Ireland also sent its Minister to the meeting at the commission. We are naturally interested in the Foyle Commission because the ceasefire and the Framework document have given added importance to such institutions. May I ask whether the Foyle Commission has genuine popular support? How are local people given an opportunity to have a say in what is provided by it? Who provides the purse? Can the commission's role be extended without new primary or secondary legislation? If it is necessary to obtain legislation, when shall we see the colour of that legislation?
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para104"></a>Finally, I want to say a word about the Tower Museum in Londonderry that I visited. It is a noteworthy museum. It depicts the origins and development of its community <P>


<a name="column_485"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the banks of the Foyle and its solid traditions of absolute loyalty since early days. Obviously, much thought had gone into the planning of that museum. I wondered how the history of the past 25 years will be presented&#151;obviously it will have to be recorded and interpreted&#151;to the new generation of schoolchildren in the schools of Northern Ireland. That is difficult territory but I leave that thought with the Minister.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para105"></a>I shall not raise any further issues. I welcome the order as I welcome the good news from Harland and Wolff, Shorts and Sainsbury, though I take note of what my noble friend Lord Fitt said in regard to Sainsbury. I look forward to some enlightenment and assurances on the few questions I asked.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_time6"></a><H5>8.20 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-19_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I thank your Lordships for the usual high standard of contributions which I have come to expect on Northern Ireland issues. I was delighted that on the whole the views expressed were extremely optimistic about the future and shared my view that, while there is much to do, there is now the possibility to do it.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para106"></a>I welcome also the return of the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, to the Front Bench on Northern Ireland issues. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, should be grateful that he has such an able substitute to call upon. I join the noble Lord in saying that we miss the contributions of the noble Lord, Lord Blease, to Northern Ireland debates. I am afraid we also miss now the noble Lord, Lord Holme, who tonight brought a touch of elegance to the debate. Unfortunately he had to leave because of the commitment that caused his elegant dress. I have no doubt that he will read every word that I say with great care and follow up if I do not answer his questions. I will try to cover all the matters raised. There were many which were on common ground and the noble Lord touched on some of the most important issues on Northern Ireland. If I miss anything, I shall make certain that I reply in writing.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para107"></a>Before I start with the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, perhaps I can take issue with him. It could be said that geographically Northern Ireland is peripheral. But we feel that our task is to convince the world that Northern Ireland is the centre of the universe, and we spend our time trying to do that&#151;with some success.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cooke of Islandreagh, speaks with direct first hand knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland and raised the issue of what may be termed "peace dividend money". The ceasefires have allowed the security forces to respond to a diminished threat and that, in turn, allowed the Secretary of State to allocate savings totalling &#163;180 million over the next three years from criminal damage and emergency provisions compensation and RUC overtime. Those savings have been reallocated to important economic and social programmes in Northern Ireland, including, I am delighted to reassure the noble Lord opposite, the provision for raising school standards. New resources will be put into first year primary school education and extra resources have been allocated to the "Making Belfast Work" initiative and also to the community work programme for the long-term unemployed. We are <P>


<a name="column_486"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore using the money&#151;we have the commitment of the Prime Minister that we can keep it&#151;for extremely constructive purposes.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para109"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cooke, referred to the cost of the health service administration. I stress that the expenditure on health and social care services in Northern Ireland is over &#163;1,500 million, or nearly &#163;1,000 per man, woman and child in the population. Those are large sums. The Government's reforms of the health and social care services were designed to improve quality and raise levels of efficiency. The devolution of responsibilities to local level encouraged greater innovation and responsiveness to the needs of patients and clients. I can assure the noble Lord that the cost of administering the services is kept under close review.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para110"></a>Recently the DHSS imposed a ceiling on the management costs of boards. Trusts will be required to publicise their management costs in their annual reports and I am confident that moves are being made to exert downward pressure on those costs in the HPSS. It is an important issue. The noble Lord opposite and the noble Lord, Lord Holme, raised the question of Springvale, coming from opposite sides of the scale. The situation is that an economic appraisal has been commissioned from the consultants Pieda, and the Northern Ireland Higher Education Council has been asked to consider the educational aspects. Those reports are expected in the near future. In advance of those, no comments can be made on the Springvale situation.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para111"></a>Both noble Lords also raised the question of funding for roads. The importance of the road networks in the Province is well recognised. As the noble Lord, Lord Holme, said, it is important to building the economy for the future. A sum in excess of &#163;150 million is invested annually on the development, operation and maintenance of the system. As the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, knows, there are many competing demands for funds available within the Northern Ireland block, but I am convinced that the roads message is well heard. I register the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Holme, on the reduction on expenditure by pointing out that the M3 Cross Harbour Bridge, phase one, has been completed. For those of us who use it, it brought great benefit to the speed with which we can move about the Province and therefore achieve more in our jobs.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para112"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cooke, raised the question of the budget for SPARD schemes. As he said, that was closed temporarily on 24th March to allow the department time to assess its financial commitments to farmers. The reason behind the temporary closure was to ensure that those farmers who had applied could be assured of the funds to meet their applications. That is our first requirement&#151;financially to support those farmers who applied. As the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, well knows, when I offered two days' amnesty for people to apply, we doubled the number of applications received. That leaves us with a considerable assessment job ahead of us and we shall reopen the scheme as soon as we are reassured in regard to the amount of money needed to honour the applications.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para113"></a>In answering that point I should share with your Lordships, with some pleasure, that farming incomes in Northern Ireland are at the highest level in real terms for <P>


<a name="column_487"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>21 years. Last year saw farm incomes up 19 per cent. There are always individual cases of difference, but there is good news for farmers in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cooke, also touched on another major issue; that is, the opportunities for fishing and for fishermen. I have much sympathy for this area because there comes the basic issue of the lack of stock in the Irish Sea and I fully appreciate that fishermen want to fish. I am aware of the problems of nephrops trawlers in the Northern Ireland fleet and the strength of feeling in the Northern Ireland industry to have them included in the next round of decommissioning. I can assure the noble Lord that those points have been made to the UK fisheries Minister, not only by me but also by the fishermen themselves.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para115"></a>Again, at the noble Lord's request perhaps I may comment on the state of the construction industry in Northern Ireland. The estimated value of construction work from planned public expenditure in 1995-96 is &#163;869 million; that is some &#163;18 million higher than the planned figure for the year 1994-95. Construction output in Northern Ireland has increased by 7.5 per cent. since 1990. As the noble Lord rightly pointed out, there are schemes such as the Royal Victoria Hospital and others, coming along. We appreciate the need that the capital and maintenance involved in the construction industry should begin at the earliest possible opportunity determined by the availability of resources.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para116"></a>Most noble Lords referred to electricity prices in Northern Ireland. The issue there is very much one of divergence with Great Britain because the United Kingdom has a low energy cost. When we are talking to potential inward investors from Japan we learn that the cost there of energy is more than twice as high as it is in Northern Ireland. I must say that I am more optimistic than noble Lords about the outlook for the future. Prices have been stable in real terms. If Northern Ireland prices are to be compared with the average in Great Britain I would urge noble Lords also to look at areas like the south west and Wales, where the problems on the edge show in the differential between the prices of electricity in more central regions.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para117"></a>There are major basic problems about the cost of electricity in Northern Ireland compared with the cost in Great Britain. There is the isolation, and the smaller scale of the market means that we cannot make the economies of scale. We have currently a heavy oil dependency but I am delighted that all projections show that that will decrease very rapidly in the coming years to the benefit of the Province. We have a difference in density of population. It costs us more to get our electricity to the people in the rural areas. Those are facts in Northern Ireland and we have to live with them.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para118"></a>Noble Lords should also look at recent fuel price rises. The cost of oil has more than doubled in the past two years and that reflects in the price. Physical problems are being tackled very hard through the development of the planned electricity interconnector and the gas pipeline project. A study is in existence on the potential for combined heat and power in Northern Ireland, which will bring considerable benefits. There will be a growth of competition within the industry in the coming years. The <P>


<a name="column_488"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>more efficient use of electricity will also help to keep a downward pressure on future prices. In the past the domestic user subsidised the large industrial user. In evening that out, there will undoubtedly be an effect on industrial users. I am also delighted that the considerable amounts allocated to the energy efficiency programmes&#151;more than &#163;6 million&#151;are focused on those people with greatest need and the older members of our population, to whom we must give support.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para119"></a>The regulator will examine very closely the position in 1997. Northern Ireland is only two years into privatisation. The first price review is in 1997. Great Britain is undoubtedly doing better because the industry was privatised earlier. However, just two years into privatisation, Northern Ireland is doing at least as well as Great Britain was doing at the same point.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, referred to the announcement made yesterday to the Select Committee by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State that the Government have decided to provide financial assistance to ensure that Northern Ireland electricity consumers will enjoy an equivalent benefit to their counterparts in Great Britain when the nuclear levy is abolished. That is to be decided in detail, but it is tremendously good news for Northern Ireland and will stop the differential increasing to the horrendous figure that the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, brought to our attention. The Public Accounts Committee report, Privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity was published on 25th May this year. A comprehensive response will be issued in due course. The noble Lord will be aware that it is not normal practice to comment on a report until a memorandum of reply has been laid. It will be laid before the House.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para121"></a>Noble Lords required information about how the European Union funds granted under the peace and reconciliation terms of the European initiative will be used. The programme is still under negotiation with the Commission and it is too early to say what the nature of the intermediary bodies might be. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Cooke, that the councils will have an important and constructive role to play in this programme because, as he rightly said, we have to encourage them to take responsibility for the future shape of the Province.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para122"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, paid tribute to the work of community relations. We all hope that we are coming to a time when peace can be consolidated and we work hard towards that end. There is a need for constructive dialogue across all communities. The budget for that is well reinforced. There will be a new urgency towards and emphasis on community relations work. Never has it been more important. We as a government are fully committed to it.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para123"></a>I listened carefully and with great interest to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. He said very strongly something with which I wholeheartedly agree. He said that the people of Northern Ireland do not want to return to violence and that they cherish the current situation. He also drew attention to the knowledge displayed in David Bleakley's book which is based on much personal experience. That recommendation also came from the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, last week. I cannot go for much longer without ensuring that I do indeed read it. The Government will react to an improved climate when it is judged correct to <P>


<a name="column_489"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do so. We have made it clear that the possibility of movement on prison issues, including release issues, in parallel with progress in other areas, is not excluded. But that would be governed by an objective assessment of the paramilitary threat and there will be no amnesty for those convicted of terrorist offences. There are no political prisoners in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para124"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked about an interim assembly. When we brought forward the framework document, it was a document for discussion. Other constitutional political parties which renounce violence can bring forward suggestions and documents for discussion, because it is important that we talk and that we build. The noble Lord indicated that there was no easy progress of this path and that we would all have to work extremely hard at it.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para125"></a>I was pleased that the noble Lord referred to the fall in the number of long-term unemployed. But there is the issue of how we get even more of these 56,000 people back into work. We shall have to be extremely innovative in our programmes to attract them back into the workforce. I stress how much we need them because the private sector estimates that we shall see 60,000 more jobs in Northern Ireland by the end of the decade. That is an ambitious estimate, but I hope it is achievable. That means that we shall need to train and skill every single member of our community.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para126"></a>A start has been made with the community work programme. The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, challenged us as to where the programme will be at the end of the century. We have had to tear up some of our projections. There is a whole new situation in Northern Ireland. Many people have come up with projections of what the figures will be. The private sector-led initiative has suggested that a 5 per cent. growth in GDP is a target to aim for. What we are doing right now is looking at all these projections, along with our own, in order to be able to publish the challenge that we are prepared to accept and, I hope, meet.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Holme, asked about provision for the Training and Employment Agency. I read it as being similar to the provisions for the previous year. I will double check that for the noble Lord, but he is absolutely right when he says that we have to upskill our population.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para128"></a>The IDB provision commences in 1995-96 with a higher provision than last year. Early indications are that we may need to seek to increase that provision even more during the current financial year because we do not intend to lose one prospect of inward investment. We shall continue to work to do that.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para129"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Holme, also questioned the size of the Government's forward commitment on funds to integrated education. I simply stress that we are committed to integrated education, but it is in response to viable proposals from parents so it is a budget which is demand led. It is moving steadily upwards and with success. Again, I put on record that the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have made it crystal clear that the full amount of the European Union Peace Funds including the matching funds, will be additional.
<P>


<a name="column_490"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para130"></a>I also say to the noble Lord that we are indeed looking at the issue of the European Investment Bank for an interest rate subsidy scheme to be administered under the European Union scheme. The details are being negotiated at the moment.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para131"></a>The visit to Washington was a wonderful success. It was made a success by those who were there. There was some doubt as regards the cost of the Washington conference, but that turned out to be a total investment in the future of Northern Ireland. We are already seeing commitments from the American corporate sector. We had the commitment of the President, the Vice-President and the two Secretaries of State for a time. Representatives of the corporate sector stayed with us throughout the breakouts of individual areas. I have already had people in my office, following the conference, who have been over to look at the opportunities. I can assure the noble Lord that we are seeing a great follow-up faster than we anticipated. I further assure him that we are well aware of the need for training and support in setting up in business that the security forces will need, we hope, in due course. Already plans are laid for that. We are seeing members of the RUC talking to our small business agency.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para132"></a>I know that the noble Lord will ensure that NIACRO works hard in ensuring that prisoners being released are offered opportunities to achieve in the community. The Foyle fisheries have enormous support locally. There are consultative committees in which views can be expressed. We shall need primary legislation and the drafting work is being undertaken at the moment. The two governments are committed to contributing a &#163;400,000 grant to the commission to ensure that its work continues.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para133"></a>It is a responsibility of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to assess housing need; to bring forward programmes and to allocate resources to meet the needs of the homeless. I shall look at the figures which the noble Lord quoted. We have increased the budget for housing. We have splendid public sector housing in Northern Ireland. I was disappointed to hear the noble Lord's views and I shall examine them.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para134"></a>The noble Lord also raised the question of the excess vote we are looking for when commenting on the Northern Ireland education system. There is a paper attached to the estimate which explains the full details and that is why I did not go into detail. It covers two issues. It is important that Government officers are spread throughout the Province. This was a relocation from Bangor to Londonderry which brought in new players who did not get it right first time. But it was not a major problem financially and neither did it have an effect on education.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para135"></a>We work constantly to ensure that children leave with qualifications. We are seeing improvements. The number of pupils obtaining one or more higher grades at GCSE has gone from 59.5 per cent. in 1987-88 to 75.8 per cent. in 1992-93. To ensure fair employment and equal benefit to all communities, we have to ensure that there are qualified youngsters and we work to do that.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para136"></a>I conclude with two points which I believe I have not covered. As regards Sainsbury's plans for the Province, some of them involve sites which already have planning permission. Those create no difficulties. My honourable <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>friend in the other place promised last night that Sainsburys, as anyone else, will be subject to normal planning requirements. There is no question of special opportunities. However, it is a great boost to the economy to see such a company interested in locating there.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para137"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Holme, raised the question of the benefit that the Republic of Ireland has with its 10 per cent. corporation tax. I am not surprised that it has managed to attract more investment in past years. With the images that were being sent around the world from Northern Ireland, I believe that IDB did a magnificent job to attract any investment to Northern Ireland in those years. We have certainly not lost out.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para138"></a>We are dealing with inward investment and with sophisticated companies which have many requirements in their future plans. Northern Ireland can indeed offer a very convincing package. What is tremendously important is that those companies that have come have frequently reinvested, which is the best tribute that could be paid to the workforce.
<P>

<a name="50622-19_para139"></a>I thank all noble Lords for their commitment to Northern Ireland and the points raised in this debate. They were important points and I shall ensure that none of them is missed. We have much to do and we now have a great opportunity to do it. When terrorism goes off the agenda we can concentrate on targeting social need to make sure that everyone shares in the prosperity which peace can bring.

<P>

<a name="50622-20_para2"></a>[Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Haskel </B>   moved Amendment No. 30:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 8, line 1, at beginning insert:
<br>
("( ) A licence shall not be granted under this section to a person until they have in place a 24 hour staffed emergency public telephone number for reporting and logging emergency calls from members of the public or the emergency services, on gas escapes and other emergencies agreed with Health and Safety Executive.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-20_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 31. These amendments deal with the safety of the general public. Although I understand that the safety regulations appear on the licence, we wish to ensure, by debating these amendments, that the proper safety of the general public is maintained. Even if the transporter is responsible for all gas escapes and emergencies, regardless of where the customer buys the gas, the public may still be confused and possibly phone the wrong number. It is no good the customer being told to ring another number or, even worse, get an answerphone.
<P>

<a name="50622-20_para4"></a>Suppliers and shippers must take responsibility for dealing with the call, logging the time and recording what action they took. They must also take responsibility for passing on the information to the transporter; otherwise a number of emergency calls may go missing or be lost in <P>


<a name="column_492"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the system. I imagine that this can be properly handled in large companies, but what about small suppliers such as housing associations which may not have adequate safety resources? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   About a year ago I made inquiries on exactly this subject. It was just as pertinent then as it will become under this legislation. I discovered that now, by statutory instrument, there has to be a telephone number attached to each gas meter. Obviously, the gas meter is the place where, in an emergency, the average gas consumer will go to find such a telephone number. Clearly, under the new regime, the number on the gas meter will be that of TransCo which, as the noble Lord explained, is responsible for dealing with gas escapes and emergencies. I am told that that will cover the situation, but I hope that my noble friend on the Front Bench will be able to confirm what I have said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, has raised an important issue, the question of safety. We cannot sufficiently emphasise how important that is. The fact that TransCo has that responsibility is satisfactory in the sense that it will inherit from British Gas the ultimate responsibility. Unfortunately, the market is now to be fragmented and people will become confused about whom they should get in touch with in an emergency. The obvious person is the supplier. It seems right that we should have both belt and braces in this situation and that the supplier should make arrangements to have the telephone manned permanently, immediately transmitting to TransCo or dealing with the matter in whatever way may be satisfactory in order to minimise any safety problems.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, who has very adequately set out the situation. I should like to establish that the smaller suppliers are not required themselves to have a man sitting at the end of the telephone but that they can contract that task to a reputable firm such as Air Call, or something similar, which operates a nationwide emergency call-out service for a variety of purposes, including doctors. That should be perfectly sufficient. Indeed, that situation appears acceptable&#151;at least at present&#151;in relation to exempt suppliers. A great deal of confusion was caused earlier by suggestions of Ofgas that telephone systems had to be operated individually by each supplier, no matter how small. If my noble friend can assure us that independent and fragmented suppliers may use a contractor to carry out the necessary reception and transmission of calls, I am sure that we shall be able to make progress.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   As my noble friend Lord Ferrers said earlier, safety is paramount in these matters. As Members of the Committee may know, we asked the Health and Safety Commission to look at the safety implications of the liberalisation of the gas supply market and we have accepted the recommendations of its report.
<P>

<a name="50622-20_para5"></a>The Health and Safety Commission concluded that there should continue to be a single contact point for reporting suspected gas leaks and that it should be the responsibility of pipeline operators to provide the emergency response. We understand that British Gas is putting in place a single 0800 freephone telephone <P>


<a name="column_493"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number. This is provided for in the draft of the standard conditions of the transporter's licence&#151;Condition 13&#151;which requires transporters jointly to arrange for the maintenance of a single continuously attended telephone service for the receipt of reports of escapes of gas. They are also required to secure adequate publicity for the service and its telephone number. I hope that that answers some of the concerns.
<P>

<a name="50622-20_para6"></a>I believe that it is preferable for there to be one party responsible for receiving reports of gas leaks and arranging for them to be dealt with rather than requiring each and every supplier and shipper to have their own procedures in place. That would lead to a multiplicity of telephone numbers and services which would only serve to confuse the customer with potentially dangerous results.
<P>

<a name="50622-20_para7"></a>If someone concerned about a possible gas leak rings the wrong telephone number, the person on the receiving end of that call will have absolutely no doubt about what number to give out. Therefore, not only is simple confusion avoided, but what might be described as "compound confusion" is also avoided.
<P>

<a name="50622-20_para8"></a>We understand that the Health and Safety Commission will shortly be consulted on new safety regulations for gas. These will in due course supersede the provisions in the Bill. The duties in respect of emergencies will be further considered at that stage. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, will find those comments a helpful explanation of the position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that reassuring response. Obviously, it is preferable for there to be only one number; otherwise there will be confusion. When the new regulations are prepared, can they be publicised in some way so that we all know about them? We have aired our concerns and have had some reassurance from the Minister and, in view of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("(b) in the case of a licence under subsection (1) (b) above, as if it were also a licence under subsection (1) (a) above and any premises specified in the direction were specified in the licence,

and references in this Part to, or to the grant of, an extension under this section, or an extension of such a licence, shall be construed as references to, or to the giving of, such a direction.

<a name="50622-20_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a technical amendment enabling the director to respond to the wishes of those who are already licensed to supply the commercial and industrial market and subsequently wish to supply the domestic market as well.

<P>

<a name="50622-20_para13"></a>The same statutory provisions govern applications for licence extensions as those which apply to the grant of new licences. The director will still need to be sure that the extension of the licence does not appear artificially to exclude an undue proportion of elderly or disabled customers. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I should like to make just one blanket point. A number of government amendments have been tabled which all seem to be technical in nature. I received the Notes on Clauses for those amendments only a couple of hours ago and I have to confess that I have written a question mark by each, meaning that I do not understand. If the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, agrees, I should prefer not to have to speak to each technical government amendment. I say that with one proviso. If in due course I discover that they are not technical, I trust that the Government will not object if I find a means of at least exploring them. I do not expect that to be the case, but it would help the passage of business at this time if the noble Lord could comment on that suggestion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston. That seems an entirely acceptable way of proceeding. I am sure that he will not find any problems.

<a name="50622-21_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: We now have a number of amendments which my noble friend Lady David and I have tabled on various matters relating to means-tested benefits. The first time this provision was raised by my noble friend Lady David, the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, and others intervened and the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, said that he was still convinced that the Government were correct. He also said that he thought that the amendment was worth looking at in case the Government had missed anything.
<P>

<a name="50622-21_para1"></a>I do not think that noble Lords would like me to repeat on amendment after amendment exactly the same arguments put so cogently by my noble friend and others. I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, is willing to agree to this suggestion with, I emphasise, no commitment. I am not necessarily convinced that he will change his mind, but as we have made the point already I honestly do not believe that anything is achieved by going over the same ground time and again. Therefore, perhaps the noble Lord will undertake to consider the situation as a whole. Perhaps I may pause there to see whether the noble Lord will agree to that, but I then have an extra and different word or two to say about the amendment.

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made. Obviously, we cannot give any commitment but we will reflect upon them. On that basis, I am delighted to acquiesce in the suggestion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the noble Lord. I deal now with the more substantive point: Amendment No. 33. The amendment is to leave out the words, "an undue proportion of". I am convinced that that is right. Essentially, the Government say that one should not distort the description or area so as to exclude, or include, people on the grounds that it contains those who are disabled or are of pensionable age. The matter of principle involved here is that one should not do it. The words "undue proportion" are neither here nor there. I do not say that it may not turn out that way, but that should not be the intention. I do not believe that the Government should insist on retaining an undue proportion of premises. I do not wish to use the wrong metaphor, but to sin a little is not, in my judgment, much better than to sin a lot. It is wrong to sin. I would have thought that all noble Lords would say that these companies should not be able to take into account the number of disabled or people of pensionable age. They just should not do it. I am puzzled as to why the Government believe it is all right for companies to misbehave a little but not if they misbehave a lot. I believe that the Government should say that that will not do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has misunderstood this part of the Bill. As I understand it, the director has a duty to make certain that a level playing field&#151;to use a horrible expression&#151;exists in these particular circumstances. I do not believe that the noble Lord should have a problem. It is not the companies who exert undue influence; it is the director who has to ensure that they do not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am afraid that the noble Lord is wrong. This is concerned with the director considering the description of the area. I take that to mean the description of the area as formulated by the companies. If the director does so, I believe that it is even more wrong. It would be an outrage if the director bore in mind these matters in taking a decision. After all, the director is still a public servant. I freely admit that I may be wrong, but I understand that this is concerned with the director taking decisions about what companies propose to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   One makes an application for a licence and the director has the duty to decide whether or not to grant it. In formulating that decision he or she will take cognisance of these words in the Bill. However, to be safer, I give way to my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   This matter presents a further problem. The words proposed in the amendment and in the Bill tend to provide a snapshot view of the area to which gas is to be supplied. We are not considering the supply of gas for just a day but for a number of years. Demographic shift may come into it. An area may go down hill or it may become gentrified (to use a ghastly word). In any event, its character may change. Does that <P>


<a name="column_496"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>then bring down the wrath of the director in order to reduce in one case or increase in another the proportion of customers who fall within that area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   It is important to be clear that, in exercising her duties, the director is obliged to comply with the matters described in Clause 1 of the Bill: the general duties of the Secretary of State and director. Any decisions that the director may take in any particular circumstances have to be set against that backdrop. We are trying not to regulate the profile of licence areas down to the last consumer. Some variations nationally are to be expected. We reject the suggestion that all suppliers should be required to develop an identical portfolio of customers. It would be absurd to set supply companies quotas for certain numbers of different customers.
<P>

<a name="50622-21_para2"></a>Reference has been made to the words "undue proportion", which appear in the amendment. It appears to me that the best way to see how the test works is to return to the underlying duties of the director. The words "undue proportion" may be described as the label that the director will use to identify whether or not there is any sin, to use the words of the noble Lord, Lord Peston. Clearly, there will be some people in these particular categories in every area. We are concerned with a situation where the matter gets out of kilter. To draw the description too tightly may make it very difficult for the director to grant licences, particularly if competitors threaten judicial review. We believe that "undue" gives a margin before she is required to reject an application. It is a form of words that is intended to be helpful to the director to enable the director in the circumstances of any particular case&#151;every case will have different characteristics&#151;to come to a proper conclusion on the facts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I always worry when I appear to be the only one who believes he is in step and that no one else understands the particular part of the Bill. My point is precisely what the noble Lord has said. Companies should not take account of the number of people who are disabled or of pensionable age in determining the area. Whether it is a lot or a few, they should not be allowed to take that into account. As I understand it, that is the nature of the Bill. Equally, the director should not be able to say to the companies that they do not have enough people in those areas. The companies may say that they have not framed it in that way but in a way that is convenient to them. It may also happen that those areas do not contain a lot of old people or the particular one does. My point is that that has nothing to do with it. That is the spirit of the Bill, and that is why "undue proportion" is wrong.
<P>

<a name="50622-21_para3"></a>If "undue proportion" was right, they could say that they had looked at the number of old people and had decided that it was not an undue proportion; in other words, that they had borne it in mind and had decided to discriminate against old people, but they were not discriminating very much. I believe that that would be outrageous. However, that is the only way in which this particular part of the Bill can be read. In another context, I would say that both the companies and the director should be colour blind, to use that racist expression, or age blind and disabled blind. However, "undue proportion" would enable them to take it into account as long as it was <P>


<a name="column_497"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 497</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not too much. I cannot believe that that is what the Government want or that they wish to go for that form of words. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for explaining his concerns. I am sure that there is nothing between us in what we are trying to do. In these circumstances, we are endeavouring to ensure that in any particular instance a licence holder does not discriminate against those classes of people. We are talking about classes of people who will inevitably be dispersed and scattered throughout the community.
<P>

<a name="50622-21_para4"></a>We do not want the applicant deliberately to frame his applications to, as it were, abandon them. Bearing in mind that wherever one looks in society some people fall into those categories, it is important to give some kind of indication and test to the director so that in looking at the matter against the backdrop of her general responsibilities she knows how to look at the way in which the applications may be drawn up to ensure that discrimination does not occur. We are concerned to avoid discrimination.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-21_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I shall give up at this point. The noble Lord makes the correct point: we are concerned that there should be no discrimination. The Bill says, "Yes, there can be some as long as it is not unduly large", which is what "undue proportion" means. That is what I am trying to get over to the noble Lord. The Bill ought to say that there should be no discrimination. That is what he has just said. That is what my amendment does.
<P>

<a name="50622-21_para5"></a>Perhaps we are becoming tired. That often happens at about this hour. If it would help the noble Lord, perhaps he would like to think about what I have said. I shall certainly reflect upon what he has said, and we will come back to it. I am genuinely puzzled, because since what he said is what I believe, what I do not seem to be able to persuade him of is that the Bill does not say what he says. Having said that, I think the best thing is to beg leave to withdraw the amendment now, and we shall come back to it.

("(6A) If the holder of a licence under subsection (1) above applies to the Director for a restriction of the licence, or for the revocation of the licence in accordance with any term contained in it, the Director shall, subject to subsection (6) above, accede to the application if he is satisfied that such arrangements have been made as&#151;

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-22_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: It is important to ensure that a gas supplier is free to withdraw from the gas supply market if he wants to. The lack of a clear right to do that would be likely to deter potential new entrants to the market and <P>

<P>

<a name="50622-22_para1"></a>The amendment therefore provides that the director should not be required to revoke or restrict a supplier's licence until the supplier has made arrangements to ensure that the customer continues to receive a supply of gas, in the case of a contractual customer, on the terms set out in his contract.

It would be quite wrong if, on the way to full competition, such companies were prevented from continuing that activity.

<a name="50622-22_para6"></a>These amendments are therefore intended to ensure that, while there is to be no direct competition between gas suppliers for domestic customers outside the pilot phases, it will be possible for suppliers other than British Gas to continue to supply gas to domestic customers in special cases before full nationwide competition is introduced.

<a name="50622-22_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to implement the Trade and Industry Select Committee's recommendations outlined in its recent report the Domestic Gas Market to consider the impact of competition in the pilot areas. The amendment is similar to Amendment No. 25. I do not wish to go over all the arguments and discussions that we had then. The Minister said that he would go away, think about it, and come back later.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-22_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   We have always accepted that competition should be introduced in a phased manner. It has taken root successfully in the industrial sector, and we recognise that the domestic market requires a phased approach, not least because of the number of premises involved.
<P>

<a name="50622-22_para10"></a>The gradual transition to national competition will provide an opportunity to test the necessary technical and administrative systems for the balancing of gas and the transfer of customers. It will allow British Gas TransCo and competing gas suppliers to iron out any problems with their systems while they are operating on a relatively small scale.
<P>

<a name="50622-22_para11"></a>We must be clear that the pilot is not intended to test the principle of whether competition will go ahead. Such an approach would cast a cloud of uncertainty over the industry&#151;both onshore and in the North Sea&#151;which would be in nobody's interest and which might well mean that suppliers did not make the investment needed for competition to be a success. It would be wrong to try to re-open, through the back door, the principle of a competitive gas market.
<P>

<a name="50622-22_para12"></a>However, although the pilot is largely about getting systems right, that is not its sole purpose. Clearly, the director will wish to consider carefully how things go, taking particular note of the results from the Gas Consumers' Council and other groups with comparable expertise. If that monitoring showed that licence conditions were not having the desired effect the director could make proposals to change them. We also recognise that there needs to be adequate information on the development of competition. This will be the case in the pilot phase and beyond.
<P>

<a name="50622-22_para13"></a>That is why, when we discussed Amendment No. 25, I said that we would be prepared to bring forward an amendment to Section 39 of the Gas Act, which would provide for the director, in her annual report, to report not just on her activities but also on the state of competition in the gas supply market in general. That report will, of course, be laid before Parliament. We believe that this will provide a proper basis for reporting by the director on <P>

<br>
("( ) Where&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-23_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 50 was grouped with Amendment No. 52. However, I understand that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, wishes to separate them, although both deal with the levy. The concept of the levy is important and needs to be supported. It is an interesting example of regulating an otherwise competitive market and goes back to my earlier point about undue proportion. There will be consumers who are particularly expensive to provide with gas but they will need the services. That will be agreed. The question is: will whoever gets stuck with supplying them receive a levy to enable the cost more easily to be met?
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para7"></a>I know that the Gas Consumers' Council was in favour of the levy. I am not certain what the potential competitors' views are on the matter. According to a document that I received from British Gas, it is interested in the matter but it has mixed feelings about some aspects of it. I can well understand that.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para8"></a>My amendment deals with a rather technical matter. What happens if the regulator decides not to levy the levy? I seem to be running into great problems of exposition with those words. They sound awful. However, I hate to use expressions like "activate the levy". I hear the Minister suggest that I should say, "raise the levy". I think that is right. If the regulator decides not to raise the levy, according to my understanding of the Bill, I believe that that would be the end of the matter.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para9"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to provide that the Secretary of State would be in a position to make the director reconsider. Equally, the amendment as drafted <P>


<a name="column_502"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 502</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>allows the Secretary of State to reverse that and say, where a levy has been raised, that he does not think that it is appropriate. We are in very deep water here because the Government have certainly gone to some trouble to try to keep the Secretary of State in other areas out of matters which should not concern him. I am in favour of that. But, equally, the Secretary of State has been given very considerable powers and here we have an area where I think noble Lords on the Government Benches should at least reflect on whether, in the case of a levy, it can just be left to the director to decide the matter.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para10"></a>Therefore, the purpose of my amendment is essentially to say that, if accepted, the amendment would put the Secretary of State in a position which I do not believe is dictatorial; indeed, it is very much a backstop position with respect to the levy. However, it is one that would be useful. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Peston, for explaining the position. It is, indeed, a complicated matter. I hope that I may be helpful to the Committee in my response. I hope that noble Lords have been able to consider the revised version of the draft standard conditions of the gas suppliers' licence, which was placed in the Library on Tuesday 20th June. Standard Condition 6, which was numbered 6A on the last round, has been revised in the light of further consideration and of the detailed consultation that we have carried out.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para11"></a>Condition 6 sets out in detail the procedures to be followed by a gas supplier to claim for a "special customer payment". Condition 7 of the public gas transporters' licence sets out the obligations on the transporter if a claim is duly made. It should be noted that it is the companies concerned that initiate the "levy" procedure, not the Secretary of State or the director. That is an important protection for the companies concerned.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para12"></a>The procedures include provisions for both the Secretary of State and the director to consult the applicant and other interested parties following an application, and to consider their representations. They provide a timetable after which, if the Secretary of State and director simply do nothing, the claim is deemed to have been approved.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para13"></a>The supplier, therefore, has every opportunity to make his case both to the Secretary of State and to the director before a decision is made. The director is required to review claims against carefully set out criteria, and the Secretary of State then has a power to veto the claim.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para14"></a>The Secretary of State, therefore, already has an opportunity to form a view on a claim for payment. I do not believe it to be necessary to add the further level of scrutiny or appeal, given that the licence already sets out detailed criteria for the director's consideration. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, will find my response reassuring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, for his reply. I should, again, apologise to the Committee because, although I picked up a copy of the draft standard conditions of the gas suppliers' licence yesterday, I would be misleading noble Lords if I tried to pretend that I mastered it in any form whatever. My immediate response to trying to look at it at all was one of being totally appalled.

<a name="50622-23_para15"></a>I take it that the Minister is saying that my amendment is actually covered in the licences to the degree that he feels that I ought to be happy. For the moment, I am willing to accept that view. However, I have to warn the Minister that, being me, I am quite likely to read the document in some detail and come back saying, "My judgment is that the draft licence does not say what the noble Lord said". For the moment, all I understand is what the Minister told me and I find that to be excellent. In the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
("(8A) Where&#151;
<br>
(a) the holder of a licence under section 7A(1) (a) has supplied an undue proportion of premises owned or occupied by persons who are disabled or of pensionable age, or who have defaulted in the payment of charges;
<br>
(b) the conditions included in that licence make provision for the holder to apply for payments to be made to him by virtue of section 7B(5) (b) (ii) above; and
<br>
(c) that holder of that licence ("the claimant supplier") applies for such payments to be made;
<br>
the Director shall, as soon as practicable after an application has been made, require such public gas transporter as he considers appropriate so to raise its charges for the conveyance of gas as to provide the amount described in subsection (8B) below and to pay that amount to the claimant supplier.
<br>
(8B) The amount referred to in subsection (8A) above is the amount which is requisite to secure that the ability of the claimant supplier to finance the carrying on of the activities which he is authorised or required by his licence to carry on is not adversely affected by reason of his supplying premises of the nature described in subsection (8A) (a) above or such lesser amount as would be required by an efficient supplier of those premises for that purpose.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50622-23_para19"></a>The noble Earl said: The levy concept in the Bill is designed to ensure that suppliers who concentrate only on supplying the most profitable customers are required to contribute to the cost of supplying more vulnerable groups. High cost groups include older and disabled customers and those who have genuine difficulty in paying their bills. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Inglewood recognised this and the requirements of these groups when he replied to Amendment No. 19 earlier this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para20"></a>These groups often require special services that at the moment are provided free of charge. I believe it would be clearly wrong for these special services to be unavailable. The director of Ofgas has already said that all consumers will have the choice of gas in 1998. I think that is right in theory but wrong in practice. For instance, if a company was to apply for a licence for, say, North London, it would fulfil many of the criteria that we have been discussing but the choice for the elderly could be severely restricted and thus it would be quite wrong for one company alone to <P>


<a name="column_504"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have to shoulder the burden of supplying the elderly and those who have difficulty in paying their bills while other companies market those more fortunate around them.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para21"></a>The concept of the levy bridges this gap by spreading these costs across all suppliers. I would prefer it if selected marketing did not occur and the levy was not needed, but I do not think that is a practical proposition. I fear that the levy will be needed and my concern is that the Bill as it stands does not make the situation as clear as it should be. It leaves too much to the uncertainty of the behaviour of the regulator. For example, the director general of Ofgas is given discretion to determine what level of excess costs should be regarded as having materially affected a licensee's business and therefore whether a levy should be granted at all. In a competitive market, as we have seen in the industrial sector recently, suppliers' margins may be quite small and this needs to be properly considered. We should also bear in mind when considering the issue that the current regulator has already shown unwillingness to raise an energy efficiency levy for which she feels there was insufficient statutory backing.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para22"></a>The amendment has three objectives. The first is to set out clearly the relevant circumstances where the levy provision should apply inclusion in the statute and also takes the levy outside the regulator's discretion to change the standard licence conditions. Secondly, it would ensure a reasonably prompt reaction on the part of the director general of Ofgas to any request that the levy should be implemented; and, thirdly, it would provide some discretion for the director general as to the amount, and it would make absolutely clear that this provision is not intended as a protection for the inefficient supplier.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para23"></a>If there was less uncertainty about the implementation of the levy, there would indeed be some great benefits. Above all, it would increase the likelihood that customers who need special services would enjoy a choice of supplier. In doing so it would contribute enormously to securing the very choice about which my noble friend Lord Ferrers waxed lyrical on Amendment No. 3. After all, the major deterrent for new gas companies offering to supply these customers is the extra cost of doing so coupled with the uncertainty as to whether these costs could be recovered through the levy mechanism. If we remove this uncertainty, as my amendment seeks to do, we make high cost customers considerably more attractive to serve. I believe that is part of what the Bill seeks to do. I beg to move.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I support the amendment. The noble Earl put very clearly the case in relation to the levy. It also enables me again to underline my view on this "undue proportion" matter. It seems to me that a firm with a given area might say, "I should like to have a go at competing in this area of the country. I think I can make a go of it and I think that I can make some money". Someone then comes along and says, "Well, you know that there are quite a lot of old people in that area". I want the firm to be able to say that it will not take its decision on a discriminatory basis but that it wants to be a gas supplier which supplies gas on all-fours. But if it turns out that that firm has committed <P>


<a name="column_505"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 505</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>itself to undue cost, since it is providing a public service within the definition of the Bill, it deserves some recompense. That is the concept of the levy.
<P>

<a name="50622-23_para24"></a>I like in particular the noble Earl's point about removing uncertainty. Of course any degree of competition involves taking risks. We cannot get rid of risks. It may be that the Minister will tell me that I must look at this peculiar yellow document which contains the licensing conditions and that I do not have to worry. If that is so, all well and good. But it seems to me that the noble Earl is right to say that we want firms to be disabled and pension blind. We want them to compete but we do not want them to end up bankrupt because they have done the right thing when others, in a way, have not. That is why one must be supportive of that line of thought.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   This is obviously an important point and it is very much on the same subject matter as the penultimate amendment that we discussed. I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Caithness for setting out his case at length.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para0"></a>I suspect that I shall not disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Peston, because I must tell him that it is important to look at the yellow document and at Condition 6 which deals with special customer payment claims. That document stretches to five pages and covers many of the points which are germane to this matter. The amendment sets out criteria which the director must use in considering whether a levy should be raised; removes the Secretary of State's veto; and requires a decision as soon as practicable after an application has been made. We have considered very carefully representations that have been made to us about the criteria and timescale for the director's decision on such a levy under Standard Condition 6.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para1"></a>The purpose of having an economic regulator is precisely to ensure that these sorts of decisions are taken by an independent person with expert knowledge of the industry, and are not subject to political intervention. Condition 6 sets out a clear set of criteria and it will be up to the director to exercise her role in the levy payment arrangements in the light of those criteria and of her statutory duties.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para2"></a>The revised draft condition contains a clear timetable for the decision and detailed criteria to be applied. We believe that these form a more appropriate balance than the necessarily abbreviated description in the amendment. We also consider that the Secretary of State's veto should be retained, as a levy has a clear political component.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para3"></a>I hope that my explanation will have assisted my noble friend, in particular by drawing attention to the new draft conditions, because they go a long way towards meeting many of his anxieties.

<A NAME="50622-24_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and I am grateful also for my noble friend's reply. Like the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I shall have more time to read these documents in the future than I have had in the past 24 hours. I must get used to that, having been very spoilt for 10 years being served with lots of briefs at the right time. It is much more difficult trying to do it all oneself.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para4"></a>The simple point which I hope that my noble friend has taken on board is that we want there to be not only competition among gas suppliers but competition for every single group of people within the area where licences are granted. That is extremely important.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale said that he has been inundated already. That does not surprise me because nothing has happened yet. When independent gas suppliers start to look at areas throughout the country, it would be easy to say that, although they have a licence for that area, they will not target the elderly or those who find it difficult to pay. As my noble friend Lord Ferrers would love it to be called, they will cherry pick the good ones and one company will be left under a duty to supply the elderly and those most disadvantaged. That company will then have to absorb the extra costs and the costs of the free service. That is not equal and fair competition. That is the point. I hope that it is covered to my satisfaction in the documents to which my noble friend referred. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50622-24_para9"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 53, I speak also to Amendments Nos. 116 and 118.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para10"></a>We move to the standard conditions that will be applied. I believe that standard conditions should apply to all types of licence holders. In fact, standard conditions apply to gas shippers and gas suppliers, but they do not apply to, and are excluded under the Bill, as regards gas transporters. That seems to be an anomaly. I wonder why that is so. Perhaps my noble friend will explain. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain the position to my noble friend. I thank him for proposing the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para11"></a>The competitive position for a public gas transporter under the new regulation framework is not comparable to that of a gas supplier or gas shipper. A gas supplier, or a gas shipper, will be in equal competition for the same customers with other gas suppliers, or gas shippers. That is the point of introducing competition and we want to ensure, by restricting the director's ability to modify licence conditions in ways which might offer unfair competitive advantage to some players, that such competition takes place on an equal basis.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para12"></a>A public gas transporter, however, will have a monopoly on gas conveyance in his own authorised area. Not only that, but British Gas TransCo will undertake the great majority of gas transportation for the foreseeable future. There is no question of TransCo being equal to other public gas transporters, and there will be numerous special conditions applicable to it.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para13"></a>There will be direct competition between public gas transporters in the creation of new pipeline networks and the conveyance of gas through them. Here, both the director and the Secretary of State are under a duty to secure effective competition under their general duties. <P>


<a name="column_507"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The director will be required to bear this general duty in mind when considering modification to a public gas transporter licence.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para14"></a>I hope that my noble friend will now feel that he understands the position underlying the clauses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-24_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I am grateful for my noble friend's explanation; it certainly helps. However, I believe that we still have a problem. Of course the position of the gas transporter is different from that of the suppliers and producers by the very nature of the pipe system at present. However, competition will increasingly be developed in that area as more people wish to put in their own pipelines as extensions from the existing TransCo system. There is, indeed, a system at Swindon at present. As more such systems develop, there needs to be a degree of certainty in the minds of the existing pipeline company, TransCo, and those who wish to come into the market, that they will all be treated equally.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para15"></a>I come back to the same point regarding equal competition. There needs to be security of supply and equal treatment of the shippers who use that pipeline.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para16"></a>We do not want conditions relaxed, so that a developer asks for tenders for a supply to a new housing development, takes the cheapest supply from a new competitor in the market, and finds that the size of the pipe does not produce enough gas to keep everyone warm and all the systems working in the first sharp cold winter that we have. Those are the kinds of conditions which could be relaxed. That is the point that I am driving at. When I read the Official Report tomorrow, I hope that what my noble friend says will reassure me. Perhaps we could arrange to have a discussion between now and a later stage to make certain that my concerns are met. Unless my noble friend wishes to say something further, I shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   It may be of assistance to my noble friend if I explain that there will be standard conditions for public gas transporters but that it is right to have more flexibility to take account of the differing characteristics of public gas transporters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-24_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   That is indeed more helpful. We are making a lot of progress. When shall I be able to see those standard conditions?

<a name="50622-24_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that gas suppliers produce written material for customers and potential customers in plain language so that they do not have some of the problems that the Committee has had this evening. It is important that all customers should receive information from competing gas suppliers that is easy to understand. The duty could apply to such written materials as letters, bills, price information, and promotional material. Contracts from gas suppliers are already covered by the unfair terms in consumer contract regulations. The requirement can then be extended to the broader range of materials. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-24_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   We agree that it is important that information provided to customers should be readily comprehensible. If I am allowed to introduce a personal aside, it would not necessarily be obvious to the average customer from reading the Bill exactly what is being proposed. Obviously, that is important, particularly in the context of the safety considerations that apply. However, we would expect competition to provide a strong incentive to suppliers to make themselves clearly understood. If they produce leaflets full of incomprehensible jargon, they are unlikely to be very successful in winning and retaining customers.
<P>

<a name="50622-24_para20"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said, certain protection is provided by the new regulations on unfair terms contracts. We argue that to go further would involve excessive regulatory intervention. It ought not to be for the director general to tell suppliers how to write their advertisements.

<a name="50622-25_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: I apologise to Members of the Committee who may have thought that we were about to have a great row on Amendment No. 56. I felt that this was not the time of night to get involved in such matters.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para6"></a>Amendment No. 57 stands in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and myself. The noble Baroness regrets that another engagement prevented her staying in the Chamber for this amendment. It is an extremely important one, and I thought that at least I should air some of the argument now, although I am fairly certain that we shall want to return to it.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para7"></a>As the Committee is aware, next month the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 come into effect. They are supposed to implement the European directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts. The directive states that persons or organisations having a legitimate interest under national law in protecting consumers should be able to take representative legal action to prevent the continued use of unfair terms in consumer contracts. That is an easier way of ensuring justice than the complainers having the expense and hassle of taking legal action themselves.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para8"></a>The difficulty with the directive&#151;I blame myself partly&#151;is that the Government gave that role exclusively to the Office of Fair Trading. I and my advisers are convinced that this does not place into English law either the wording or the intention of the directive. Since I am speaking for the Opposition on this matter, I have to admit that I do not have the faintest idea of what happened on that occasion. I do not recall being involved with the matter. I do not know how it got through without my arguing about it or even saying that the regulations would not do. At some point, when I have a little time, I shall find out just where I blundered on all these matters.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para9"></a>The fact remains that our version of the directive, as we put it in regulations, is flawed. Here, at least in the case of gas, is an opportunity to put the matter right. In the simplest possible terms, the amendment ensures that the powers that the regulations which the Government gave to the OFT to act on the directive would be extended to Ofgas and the Gas Consumers Council so far as gas supply contracts are concerned. It will also permit other bodies of a similar nature to bring proceedings provided that the courts thought that it was in the public interest for them to do so.

<a name="50622-25_para10"></a>I believe that this is an immensely important matter. It is not a topic that I want to debate at this hour of the night when we are discussing detailed matters concerned with implementing a European directive. I wanted simply to take this opportunity to place the arguments on record. I do not propose to divide on the amendment at this stage. However, I warn the Chamber that this is not the last that it will hear on the matter. That is partly because I blame myself for bungling the whole thing in the first place. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   In that case, perhaps I may be permitted at this late hour to give a preliminary view on what the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has just said. Notwithstanding the arguments that he has advanced on the right way to implement a directive of this or any other kind emanating from Brussels, I am absolutely certain in my own mind that one should not pick off industries one by one.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para11"></a>I know that there is a great temptation, simply because there is a Gas Bill going through this place or indeed Parliament generally, to do just that. But whatever the answer to the conundrum posed by the noble Lord, it seems to me that it ought to be general and not specific.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-25_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   This new clause seeks to give the Gas Consumers Council, the director and anyone acting in the public interest, the right to seek an injunction to prevent the continued use of unfair terms. I understand that the Consumers' Association has sought judicial review of the Government's implementation of Article 7 of the Unfair Contract Directive. The matter is therefore now before the courts.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para12"></a>The Government are confident that they have correctly implemented the directive. Regulation 8 of the Unfair Terms and Consumer Contracts Regulations provides the Director General of Fair Trading with the power to seek an injunction to prevent the continued use of unfair contract terms.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para13"></a>The issue of to whom it is appropriate to grant such a power is one which goes a great deal further than just gas supply. It relates to consumers in general. I agree with my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale. It is inappropriate to deal with the matter in a piecemeal manner in this way and solely in relation to gas.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para14"></a>We also consider it unnecessary and undesirable to extend that power of the Director General of Fair Trading to seek injunctions to other bodies such as the director, the Gas Consumers Council or anyone acting in the public interest. Ofgas and the Gas Consumers Council will be able to liaise with the Office of Fair Trading in the usual way over any relevant consumer complaints. It is undesirable to establish an alternative route by which unfair terms can be challenged. That would cause duplication of the role of the Director General of Fair Trading and possible inconsistencies.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para15"></a>This is not a matter for the Bill. It should be addressed, if at all, in the context of the regulations. It would be anomalous to have different provisions for gas than for other industries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the noble Earl. I must be extremely careful, bearing in mind his remarks on judicial <P>


<a name="column_511"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 511</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>review. If I say anything which the noble Earl feels is out of order, I hope that he will immediately leap to his feet and stop me.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para16"></a>I must say to him in terms, having read the directive, that it is inconceivable that our regulations incorporate the provisions correctly in English law. I do not seek to bias whoever is taking the decisions on judicial review, but the directive does not stand up for one minute to anybody who has read it. What we have done is simply not right. Let me add, since I have been involved in one or two other attempts to say this sort of thing, that the noble Earl's department has been getting other implementation directives in regulations wrong as well. Those are matters I shall come back to.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para17"></a>I understand the argument raised originally by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and now by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers. It would be infinitely better for the whole thing to be sorted out once and for all. That is what judicial review may do and that would suit me. On the other hand, if I can reverse the argument, the Gas Bill is the Bill before us. We do not have a Bill on general representations or anything else. This is all we have got. I tend to make the best of a bad job. If the Gas Bill is all I have, then that is the bit I shall try to make a little better.
<P>

<a name="50622-25_para18"></a>The noble Lord and the noble Earl are not wrong. There is always a problem of picking off a specific industry. However, we do not have before us a general industry privatisation Bill or anything like that. The Gas Bill is what we are dealing with and I am trying to deal with it. I have made my points, which is what matters to me. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="50622-26_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The wording in the 1986 Act is carefully drafted to ensure a proper balance between the public interest and the commercial and private interests of individuals and businesses.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para1"></a>I believe it is right to allow individuals and businesses to decide whether they are prepared for information relating to their affairs to be disclosed.

<a name="column_513"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>retailers are especially vulnerable to hazards or barriers which arrive outside their premises. Most of them have only one entrance and making it less accessible can deter potential customers and will certainly curtail window gazing. I need not remind the Committee of the valuable contribution made by small businesses to our economy and to the creation of jobs, but so many of them at the moment are on the edge of viability and the losses caused by the reduction of trading during the roadworks could mean the difference between survival and extinction.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para11"></a>There is an anomaly in that at present a water company has to compensate anyone to whom damage is caused while it is performing its functions as a water company. In fact, compensation amounting to roughly &#163;130 million annually is paid by the water companies in this way. That proves the necessity for this amendment because the disruption is exactly the same as that caused by the water companies and it also illustrates that the calculation of such losses is feasible. It also establishes a precedent, if one is required.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para12"></a>The amendment is supported by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, which represents some 200,000 businesses, and by the British Retail Consortium. Both organisations have evidence of difficulties caused to small businesses in the circumstances I have described and they have supplied details of many actual cases where businesses have been pushed over the edge. I had intended to quote those cases but in view of the lateness of the hour I shall leave them for the moment.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para13"></a>An amendment similar to this was proposed during the Report stage of the Bill in another place following discussion between the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Minister. But the amendment was withdrawn at the request of the Minister on the basis of a letter he had received from the chairman of British Gas saying that he would,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"consider whether it might be possible in narrowly defined and extremely exceptional circumstances to make some form of ex-gratia payment".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para14"></a>Later, the Minister admitted that even the ex-gratia payment might not be possible. It is, after all, a discretionary payment which British Gas might or might not choose to pay. That does not seem a satisfactory solution.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para15"></a>I find it very difficult to understand the Government's resistance to this proposal. They have constantly reiterated their belief in the value of small businesses to the economy. They applaud the fact that those businesses are an important element in providing jobs. There is no doubt that businesses are suffering loss as a result of interruptions caused by roadworks. The payments involved would not come from the taxpayer and, indeed, need not come from the gas consumer, in view of the large profits enjoyed by British Gas at the moment.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para16"></a>As I said, the water companies must compensate for their damaging activities, so why not British Gas?

<A NAME="50622-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Despite the lateness of the hour, perhaps I may say that I regard this as an immensely important amendment. There are two aspects of it which I was hoping that my noble friend would clarify since I read the matter slightly differently. Although she mentioned small firms, the need for compensation does not apply just to them. I assume that it applies to any firm damaged by these activities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-26_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   Perhaps I may interrupt my noble friend for a moment. I concentrated on small businesses because the effect on them is so much more immediate and so dire.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Nevertheless, as my noble friend says, the provision would apply to all businesses. My reading of the matter is that the responsibility is not to British Gas but to any gas company that digs up the road and generally creates economic disruption. In other words, there is no specific reason why British Gas should be singled out here.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para17"></a>That takes me to what I regard as the most important point of all, which I have argued before. Once we privatise utilities we are dealing with private businesses. Therefore, rights that we would have given to public utilities do not necessarily carry over. I am trying to persuade Members of the Committee all the time that we are now talking of the private sector. Just as any other private firm would not be given the right to disrupt another firm's business in anyway whatsoever&#151;it would have to compensate and there are laws to deal with that&#151;that applies to utilities generally. Since we are discussing British Gas, it applies to that company. I made the point about pylons on another occasion.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para18"></a>One of the problems is that the Government have not faced up to the consequences of privatisation, particularly in the context of competition. It seems that all that is being stated here by my noble friend is a general proposition that if a business engages in activity which is damaging to another business in the sense of this case&#151;namely, that it is made difficult to get into that business's premises or they are made less attractive to customers&#151;they should be liable to compensate. I assume that arbitration would lead to decent outcomes.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para19"></a>My noble friend did not mention this point. If we are discussing work that has to be done because of danger, then clearly it must not be held back. Nonetheless, even in the case of danger, if someone smells gas and the gas supplier digs up the road, and the result causes me, a small retailer, to lose business for a few days, I do not see why I should bear the cost. I did not cause the gas leak; I am just trying to run another business.
<P>

<a name="50622-26_para20"></a>I am convinced in my own mind that the line taken by my noble friends Lady Nicol and Lady Hilton of Eggardon and by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, is the correct one. To put it mildly, I shall be interested in any counter-argument. I am not going to delay for that tonight, but if there is a counter-argument, I <P>


<a name="column_515"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>am sure that I can produce further arguments. We are now discussing private firms delivering their products. They have to deliver them in a way which is not damaging to other private firms trying to do the same.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I thought that was a temptation for me to produce a counter-argument. I have absolutely no such argument to produce on this occasion. It was very refreshing to hear the dulcet tones of the noble Baroness contributing to this debate. She has been very generous in waiting a very long time so to do. On this particular issue, as on so many others, she has hit the nail on the head, and I agree with her every inch of the way.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para0"></a>However, it occurs to me that since the Gas Act 1986 was enacted we had in 1991 the New Roads and Street Works Act which, to a tiny extent, this Bill amends. Therefore, if there is validity in the general point&#151;and I think that there is; the noble Baroness mentioned water and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, almost went so far as to talk about the electricity industry which probably has a bearing on this, as does the telecommunications industry&#151;I suggest that all these matters could be tidied up in the New Roads and Street Works Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the noble Earl to give us a little elucidation about the way in which this legislation is being handled. Schedule 4 to the Gas Act 1986 is entitled:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Power of Public Gas Suppliers to Break Up Streets, Bridges Etc."</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para1"></a>But we have a different situation now. We have TransCo and people with transport licences. The gas suppliers merely supply the gas. I would find it confusing if we were to proceed on the basis of amending an Act which is not relevant to the new situation. I am following a point which the noble Lord, Lord Peston, made. How is one to interpret the provisions? Should they not apply to transporters of gas and not to public gas suppliers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-27_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I do not blame the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, for producing this amendment and for speaking to it in the way that she did. The question of streetworks by utilities, and in particular by public gas transporters, is an important one. Often, we may not appreciate the complex engineering exercise that is necessary to keep a reliable supply of gas available on tap to some 18&#189; million customers at any one time. Maintaining this network in a safe and effective state requires a great deal of work for which street openings are necessary.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para2"></a>The Government do not think that there should be a general right for automatic compensation for economic loss arising from streetworks. We believe that such a general right would be inappropriate for two reasons. The first is that of practicality. There would be a great risk of inefficiency from having to process large numbers of claims arising from the extensive streetworks which a company like British Gas needs to execute, and a concern that money spent in this area will inevitably feed through to the cost of gas.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para3"></a>The second reason relates to the general principle of how streets are used. Successive governments have always taken the view that businesses should not have a right in law to any given level of passing trade and that traders must take the risk of loss due to temporary <P>


<a name="column_516"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 516</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disruption of traffic flows along with all the other risks of running a business. If that principle is not accepted, one wonders where one would stop. As well as utilities' works, streets are resurfaced, closed or made one-way; and the emergency services can affect the traffic, too. One can go on for quite some time, listing all the different permutations of how businesses can be affected.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para4"></a>However, I recognise that the legal position, which the Government are not minded to alter, could bear heavily on small businesses on the very rare occasions when long-term and substantial disruption takes place. There comes a point when the general interest in utilities being able to operate streetworks efficiently and the general principles I have described could lead to harsh costs falling on such a small business.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para5"></a>It was for that reason that the Minister for Industry and Energy asked the chairman of British Gas what further he could do to assist. The chairman informed my right honourable friend that TransCo is revising its existing procedures to improve communication and co-operation with owners of commercial premises. British Gas will discuss with individual business owners issues including vehicular access, customer access, special notices and any special requirements. Beyond this, and subject to certain conditions, British Gas has undertaken that in those exceptional cases where small businesses suffer severe and clearly established loss of business over a prolonged period as a direct result of streetworks carried out by British Gas or its agents, British Gas will give sympathetic consideration to claims in respect of financial loss on an ex gratia basis.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para6"></a>Since the discussions in Committee in another place, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, referred, British Gas has agreed to set up a compensation scheme for small firms. That was put on the record in another place at Report stage. My right honourable friend in another place has put on record the precise terms of this undertaking. On those terms, I hope that the noble Baroness can feel satisfied that something is being done to help small firms. With regard to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, Schedule 3 amends the words in the old Act so that it refers to public gas transporters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-27_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I had not expected to intervene on this amendment. However, I am slightly disappointed by my noble friend's reply. He said that one of the reasons for not accepting it was the cost of processing claims. This is now a private industry. It is not the Government but a private industry that must bear the cost in a fair and equal competitive market. We must let the industry face up to the real world. I believe that the noble Baroness has a point.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para7"></a>I should like to press my noble friend on two areas. First, given the strong arguments that he has adduced, why do we have the present situation for water? He did not answer that particular point. The noble Baroness made a convincing case to make the same rule for water apply to gas companies. Secondly, we will have more competition in the pipeline industry. We already have a separate pipeline system in Swindon. As developments take place around the country which serve both residential and commercial properties, it will not just be TransCo that provides the pipeline system. It is all very well for British Gas to say this, that or the other. It does not apply to all the <P>


<a name="column_517"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>players in the market. Now that the monopoly has been broken, if that is the answer and what everybody supports, I feel that added strength is given to the argument of the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-27_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My noble friend said that he was not convinced by what I had said. I am disappointed. I thought that I was wholly convincing. However, my noble friend is enormously stubborn sometimes in his reception of ideas. I will try to explain the position to him. He said that now British Gas was privatised, it was a private company. I say to my noble friend that that has nothing to do with it. We are talking about what happens when streets are dug up. I tried to explain to the Committee that if British Gas was told that if it dug up a street it would have to inquire of everyone in the street who would be disaffected, and by how much, it would result in quite a large exercise in processing documents and paying people.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para8"></a>My noble friend says that that is different now because British Gas has been privatised. That is not so. I do not know where my noble friend lives. Perhaps he lives in a very esoteric place. The whole area in which I live has been disrupted recently because of the installation of fibre-optic cable. I do not know whether everyone has received compensation, but I have not. Perhaps I was not sensible enough to apply for it. One starts with water. It was decided to resurface my particular street a short while ago, and the whole area was closed. Should one say that everyone should get out their claim forms and claim for that? I do not believe that to be realistic.
<P>

<a name="50622-27_para9"></a>My noble friend also said that the noble Baroness Lady Nicol had a point. I agree with him. I said that she had a point, and I told her what my right honourable friend the Minister for Energy had said in another place. He has spoken to British Gas who have made some provisions. I hope that I have satisfied both my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, in which case that will be two birds with one shot, and both in the opposite direction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-27_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   What my noble friend says makes me even more stubborn. There is a huge difference. If it was a public company owned by the Government, it would be taxpayer's money that would be used to pay compensation. In this case it is private sector money, and therein lies the difference. It is now in competition with other potential transporters of gas. The situation is dramatically different. Of course, one is talking about digging up streets. I have to say to my noble friend that if he thinks that I am stubborn, I find his arguments even less convincing on that second attempt.

<P>
<A NAME="50622-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I shall intervene only briefly, but I am still disturbed that the Minister continues to refer to British Gas. We are no longer discussing British Gas. We are now discussing the potentially competitive privatised gas industry. British Gas will have no special role once the Bill becomes law. The chairman of British Gas can talk about handing out money, but we are not discussing that any more. We are discussing the <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-28_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I accept the noble Lord's rebuke. It is what one describes as a slip of the tongue. I should have made it clear that it was any gas transporter, and not just British Gas, which is affected.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My noble friend is right. The gas industry has been freed from the constraints of public ownership with much acclaim all round. It must be prepared to accept the responsibility that goes with that freedom. That includes being responsible for the loss and damage that it causes and for paying up in the way that any other commercial organisation must pay up.
<P>

<a name="50622-28_para0"></a>I am disappointed that all the answers given by the Minister were those given in another place. He has added nothing new. The letter from British Gas is the one that is already being discussed with the British Retail Consortium and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. They were totally dissatisfied with that as a solution. It is because of that continuing dissatisfaction that I felt that I could bring the amendment forward tonight.
<P>

<a name="50622-28_para1"></a>We should have further discussion on this issue with the Government to see whether there is not some way in which we can move forward. The Minister has not answered why it can work for water and not for the gas industry. I do not know whether he has an answer he wants to give before I decide what to do with the amendment. It seems to me that the two cases are a parallel. On the question of road works the matter is different because the thing is over and done with in two or three days at the most, and it is in the public sector and for the general good.
<P>

<a name="50622-28_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Peston is right. When the stand was taken that no compensation could be paid by the gas industry, it was then a publicly owned corporation. We were all expected to shoulder the burdens of it, because we all shared the benefits. That has changed completely. It is now open to competition and to taking on its responsibilities. Does the Minister want to answer the question as to why water is different before I decide what to do with the amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622-28_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   That is fair. I did not answer the question about water, and I apologise for that. The noble Baroness did, incidentally, talk about British Gas. After my rebuke by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, I grovelled with an apology and said that the provision applied to all privatised gas companies. Of course TransCo will retain a de facto monopoly in the transportation of gas in most of the country for some time. Of course, the provision would apply to any transporter.
<P>

<a name="50622-28_para3"></a>Water, of course, is different. The arrangements in respect of street works by water companies are anomalous. None of the other utilities, local authorities, highway authorities, or any other person with rights to break or close streets is subject to a requirement to pay compensation for economic loss to businesses which are affected by the works. The requirement in water appears <P>


<a name="column_519"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column 519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to have arisen following judicial interpretation of disputed wording in old legislation, which was subsequently clarified in a consolidation Act.
<P>

<a name="50622-28_para4"></a>I should add that the compensation provisions in water go wider than street works, and include compensation for interfering with a person's right to enjoyment of his own land where economic loss is clearly appropriate. The existence of a provision for compensation in respect of street works by water companies, whose origin is unclear, is not a justification for introducing an inappropriate obligation in the case of gas, but I recognise that the Committee is concerned about this point.
<P>

<a name="50622-28_para5"></a>The noble Baroness made a number of good points and I wish to consider all that has been said before the next stage of the Bill. Obviously, I cannot tell the noble Baroness what my conclusions will be but I shall consider what has been said.

In 1994&#150;95, in the crucial area of the provision of safe accommodation, over &#163;10 million has been provided by the Government, including &#163;3 million in revenue support, for 1,800 bed spaces in women's refuges and additional capital of &#163;5.8 million to develop further schemes through the Housing Corporation. &#163;151,000 is also being provided in core funding to Women's Aid Federation (England) to provide various support services. &#163;140,000 has been provided over three years towards the enhancement of their national telephone help line and &#163;55,000 to fund a national housing co-ordinator.

Papers received from the German authorities have been in support of their request for Mr. Yilmaz's extradition and have been served on Mr. Yilmaz. Since this case concerns possible extradition to Germany, by virtue of the European Convention on Extradition Law 1990, the prima facie case requirement does not apply. In considering whether to commit Mr. Yilmaz, though, the court of committal will be concerned as to whether the offences in the authority to proceed, signed by the Home Secretary on 2 December 1994, are extraditable crimes and whether Mr. Yilmaz's committal is permitted by the Extradition Act 1989.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622w02_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   In the statements from my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment on 2 and 21 March he said that he would be directing a newly-constituted Commission to carry out new structure reviews of a small number of individual districts.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para2"></a>My right honourable friend named 20 districts which he had in mind to refer to the Commission. He said that nine of these would definitely be referred; for the remaining 11 we would hold meetings with the district councils and their county councils before coming to a view. That programme of meetings is now complete. My right honourable friend has considered all of the arguments and decided that all 20 districts should be referred to the Commission for new reviews. They are: Basildon, Blackburn, Blackpool, Broxtowe, Dartford, Exeter, Gedling, Gillingham, Gloucester, Gravesham, Halton, Huntingdonshire, Northampton, Norwich, Peterborough, Rochester upon Medway, Rushcliffe, Thurrock, Warrington, and the Wrekin.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para3"></a>My right honourable friend also said that, while he would consider requests from other districts to be reviewed, it was very unlikely that he should want to add significantly to the number of referrals to the Commission. My right honourable friend has carefully considered all the requests which he has received, and <P>


<a name="column_WA31"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column WA31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in the light of those representations he has concluded that the district of Spelthorne in Surrey should be added to the list of reviews. Spelthorne is in many ways similar to the Berkshire districts which are to be given unitary status, and the proximity of Heathrow Airport creates unusual and specific problems for the authority. Against that background my right honourable friend judges that the district's case for unitary status deserves to be considered.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para4"></a>We have concluded that in these cases the arguments are substantial enough to warrant further consideration. It will be for the Commission to recommend whether or not they should have unitary status. It will then be for my right honourable friend to accept, modify or reject the proposals and Parliament ultimately to decide. My right honourable friend has not been convinced by the representations from other districts and has therefore concluded that no others should be referred to the Commission for review.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para5"></a>The Commission will be directed to carry out these reviews with effect from the beginning of July. All of them will be carried out under new guidance to the Commission. We have consulted on a draft and my right honourable friend will publish the final version in the next few days, in time for the Commission to start work promptly.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para6"></a>My right honourable friend has also considered further the case of Rutland, in particular the implications for costs and service delivery, following his Statement of 21 March. Rutland has a very clear sense of local identity and he is now satisfied that a unitary authority in Rutland would best reflect the identities and interests of the local community and secure effective and convenient local government. My right honourable friend has therefore decided to accept the Commission's recommendation for Rutland to be given unitary status. We shall be consulting in due course on a draft order to give effect to that decision.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50622w02_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   Yes. The text of the letter is as follows:
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para7"></a>Letter to Lord Marlesford from Viscount Ullswater dated 23rd May 1995:
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para8"></a>During the course of the debate on rural affairs on 10 May you raised two planning issues on which I did not have time to respond. I hope that you will find the following explanation of the Government's policy on these issues helpful.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para9"></a>First, you asked what can be done to help local planning authorities who may be intimidated by developers who threaten to sue them for costs if a refusal of planning permission is subsequently overturned on appeal.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para10"></a>Most members of local planning authorities know that there is some risk of an award of appeal costs against the authority only if they behave "unreasonably", as this term is interpreted in publishing policy guidance (currently in DOE Circular 8/93). It is a well-established principle that an award of costs does not "follow the event" of the appeal decision (as in litigation in the court). Therefore, I see no reason for authorities to feel intimidated by developers in the way you suggest. Provided each of an authority's reasons for refusing planning permission is objective, clear-cut and sustainable on its planning merits, and they can show in any appeal proceedings that they properly considered the merits of the application, by reference to stated national and local planning policies, they need not fear an award of costs against them. The great majority of planning appeals do not result in a costs application, let alone an award.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para11"></a>The published arrangements are intended to bring a greater sense of discipline to all parties involved in planning appeals. Planning authorities can also apply for their costs when they can show that an appellant has acted "unreasonably" in exercising the right of appeal. The policy is intended to apply even-handedly.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para12"></a>Second, you were also concerned that local planning authorities should not be tempted by the concept of 'planning gain'. I entirely agree with your sentiments on this issue.
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para13"></a>The Government's policy, as set out in DOE Circular 16/91, is that planning obligations, as we prefer to call them, should only be sought where they are necessary to the granting of planning permission, relevant to planning and relevant to the development to be permitted. Overall, our policy is one of reasonableness: planning obligations should relate fairly and reasonably both in scale and in kind to the proposed development. Developers should only be asked to pay for facilities which are needed as a result of their development and no more. These policies have recently been endorsed by the House of Lords decision on the "Tesco" (Witney) appeal case.
<P>


<a name="column_WA33"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column WA33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50622w02_para14"></a>I agree that planning obligations can have positive benefits. Used properly they are valuable tools which can remedy genuine planning problems and enhance the quality of development. But the use of planning obligations should not degenerate into the buying and selling of planning permission.
 While it is entirely a matter for the parties concerned whether to enter into a planning obligation, local authorities are well advised to heed what you say about the dangers of accepting inducements offered by developers. The Secretary of State remains fundamentally opposed to any attempts to influence planning decisions through the offer of unnecessary community benefits.
<P>


<a name="column_WA34"></a>

<B>22 Jun 1995 : Column WA34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3> Equally he will not support excessive demands for contributions from local authorities. Developers should not feel forced into accepting unreasonable obligations sought by a local planning authority in return for planning permission. If they do refuse, then developers have the right to appeal to the Secretary of State against any subsequent refusal of planning permission or non-determination of their application. They may also apply to the relevant local planning authority for the modification or discharge of the planning obligation, after five years, and appeal to the Secretary of State if the authority refuse the application.
