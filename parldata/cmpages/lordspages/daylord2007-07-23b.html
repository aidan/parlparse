While I recognise that he has inherited this policy, does he agree that a consultation which excludes general enfranchisement and includes blanket disfranchisement&#151;the former is the option most often chosen by other countries; the latter has been declared unlawful&#151;and on which there has been quite a long delay, might send a signal to those whom we would least like to receive it that we take time over obedience to the law and choose what we want to follow and what we do not?</p>

However, for once I do not really agree with him. The consultative paper setting out a number of options was sent out towards the end of last year. I do not think it unreasonable not to include a general enfranchisement of all prisoners. The options that have been put forward are perfectly reasonable for discussion, and Ministers are considering the outcome of the consultation on them.</p>

Given this Government&#146;s relentless thirst for change, most of which I welcome, is it not rather bizarre that British citizens registered as overseas electors who are in foreign jails are entitled to vote while their mates over here cannot do so? What about a bit of change there?</p>

He is also right to point out certain inconsistencies. However, giving enfranchisement to convicted prisoners still serving sentences in this country is a complex issue and we will come to a conclusion on it only after very careful consideration.</p>

I was not clear on that from the Minister&#146;s answer. Does he not agree that there are more important issues surrounding voting? It must be important to restore integrity to our voting system, particularly following the recent disasters of postal voting.</p>

Until now, the Government have always considered that the right to vote is part of a social contract between individuals and the state. The loss of the right to vote, reflected in the current law, was thought by the Government to be a proper and proportionate punishment for breaches of that social contract which resulted in people&#146;s imprisonment. But we have received a judgment from the European Court and it is right that we consider its implications; that is why there is a consultation. I can assure noble Lords that the Government will not come to a decision without very careful thought indeed.</p>

Has not the Court of Session in Scotland followed that judgment? Surely the answer is an immediate remedial order by the fast-track procedure. At the moment we are in line with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lichtenstein and Moldova, among others, in denying rights to vote to prisoners.</p>

I do not think an immediate remedial order is the right way forward. The Government made it clear that we would have a two-stage consultation process. We are looking at the conclusions of the first stage of consultation, and this will be followed by a further consultation. I do not think haste is required; very careful thought is needed.</p>

I do not know the timescale of the rollout, but I will inform noble Lords. It is true that tuberculosis is an infectious disease, but it is not very infectious. The incidence of TB in this country is grossly exaggerated in the press from time to time. I understand that at the beginning of this century there were about 100,000 people in this country with TB.

When I was a chairman of a local public health body, we had one contact who infected 40 people within one week. It is a highly infectious condition. Does she not think that, although you can do a certain amount in terms of immigration, it is very important to see that children are immunised against TB and protected in that way?</p>

However, I have been informed by the Department of Health that TB is quite difficult to catch and usually requires prolonged or repeated contact with a person with infectious TB, such as living in the same household. It is important that children who are going to be subjected to contact with people with TB are immunised, and for that very reason the Government now have a targeted approach to immunisation. All new-born babies who are living in areas where TB is prevalent will now be immunised.</p>

In fact, if a fourth page had to be introduced into the census, the rise in costs would be significant. There are many competing demands for the places on the three pages already identified. We cannot pretend that this issue does not have a cost dimension&#151;it has. Nevertheless, as I said, the final decision on priorities rests with Parliament.</p>

I doubt whether, without it, we could have been so sure of our facts and the costs, and the improvement might not have happened. Will my noble friend take the opinion of the House and do his best to ensure that this question has the priority that it rightly deserves?</p>

Will the noble Lord encourage those responsible for taking this decision to look at which of the other competing questions could be answered more easily by other methods of opinion survey? Much of the information that we have gathered about the role and number of carers could not have been discovered in any other way. Taking that into account, surely we should look at putting that question on the census form as a priority.</p>

That is a very important point. He will appreciate that we are increasingly concerned that we identify the number of carers and the necessary support for them in the very valuable work that they do. The other potential questions for the census&#151;indeed, all questions&#151;are examined with regard to whether the information could be gathered in any other way. I give one element of encouragement to the House, and a constructive response. The three departments for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are in favour of a question on carers being on the census.</p>

The Minister will know that, in the 2001 census, 175,000 young carers in the UK were identified, but it turns out that only 30,000 of those are currently known to carers support services. Will he bear in mind the usefulness of including a suitably worded question in the census to identify these young carers with a view to supporting them as appropriate?</p>

The whole House is aware that we needed to develop a much greater understanding of the role and needs of carers than we had a decade ago. That is why the Government have made strenuous efforts in that regard. We are looking at whether other strategies and organisations can provide the requisite information for us, but I accept the point made on all sides this afternoon that the census could play a very important role in this respect.</p>

The European Commission is conducting a review of food labelling, and country of origin requirements are being considered as part of this. The UK has already indicated to the Commission that in principle it is in favour of an extension to the rules, subject to satisfactory cost-benefit analysis.</p>

I am sure that the noble Baroness will agree with me that British shoppers would prefer to buy food from British farms. At the moment, it is possible for all the constituent parts of a processed product to be produced abroad and for it still to be labelled as British if it is processed or packed here.

The FSA produces assisting guidance, as the noble Lord may be aware. It advises, for example, that bacon produced from imported pork should be labelled &#147;Made from Danish pork cured in Britain&#148; or something similar. FSA guidance is extremely important. All the issues raised by the noble Lord will be taken into account in the context of the European Commission review, because we want to ensure that more people buy British whenever possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0707232000115"></a>We turn to the discussion of fresh amendments sent to us from another place. It might be helpful if I say a few words about the deadline for considering the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and other noble Lords raised the question of the deadline in our previous discussions and noble Lords will be aware from previous debates that, under the procedures of the other place, proceedings on a Bill that has been carried over from the last session&#151;as was the case for this Bill&#151;must be complete within 12 months of the Bill being introduced unless that period is extended. That period has been extended, by a week, to provide the other place and your Lordships&#146; House with further time to consider the very significant further amendments that the Government have brought forward.</p>

<a name="70723-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0707232000116"></a>The nub of concern with the Government&#146;s amendments so far has been that they would leave a discretion whether to extend the offence to custody. The further amendments tabled by the Government remove that doubt by extending the relevant duties of care in the Bill to include duties owed to those in custody. In a nutshell, the amendments make custody an integral part of the offence. I hope that noble Lords will agree that that is a very significant change. This is achieved by Amendment No. 10R, which also sets out a wide definition of custodial environments that will be covered. This comprehensively addresses the forms of custody identified in the amendments proposed in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70723-0003.htm"/>


<a name="70723-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0707232000117"></a>There is also a power, subject to the affirmative procedure, to amend the definition to include further forms of detention. This does not allow the definition as currently set out to be restricted or for exceptions to that definition to be made&#151;I think that your Lordships will agree that those are important points&#151;but it provides some flexibility to add further forms of custody or analogous circumstances if required.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0707232000118"></a>I am aware that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, as chairman of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, was concerned to know what this power might be used to cover. I am grateful that he spent a few minutes with me earlier to explain his concerns. Examples might be facilities used for custody by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs or detention in penal military establishments. There might be a case for extending to premises such as approved probation or bail hostels. However, there is no intention to extend this to areas that do not involve any forms of custody or detention in premises designed for holding people. That, at least in part,

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0707232000119"></a>The commencement of the new offence in respect of custody will be subject to an affirmative order. That is provided by Amendment No. 10Z. I will return to the question of timing in a moment. However, there has been widespread recognition of the need to provide some delay before this aspect of the legislation is commenced. Providing for commencement by affirmative order explicitly recognises that intention.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0707232000120"></a>These amendments bridge a gap that has troubled many in this House by moving from a discretion to extend the offence to custody to making this an integral part of the offence. That is a significant movement by the Government and I very much hope that these amendments will receive support from your Lordships&#146; House. I welcome the fact that the amendment to my Motion in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, does not seek to disagree with the amendments.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0707232000121"></a>I turn now to the question of timing. In providing for custody to be an integral part of the Bill, the Government are starting a clear process towards extending the offence to custody. However, as I and other noble Lords, including my noble friends Lord Rosser and Lord Lea, have explained on previous occasions, there are complexities in extending the new offence to custody. It is important that this process is managed properly in consultation with the services that will be affected. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice explained in the other place last week that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="0707232000345"></a>&#147;There are anxieties in the police and the Prison Service that unless they have time to understand fully the extent of these obligations and take steps to implement them, the services&#151;not at a senior level, but at a lower level&#151;will start to become risk averse, and that could have many serious consequences&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/7/07; col. 333.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000122"></a>Against that background, the Secretary of State went on to suggest that he considered that a reasonable delay would be between five and seven years.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0707232000123"></a>Concerns have been raised that that sort of timetable does not provide the necessary impetus to take matters forward, and the Government are prepared to recognise and to respond to those concerns. For that reason, I give noble Lords an assurance that the sort of timetable that the Government will aim for will be the three-year period from commencement that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, suggests in his amendment to the Motion.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0707232000124"></a>However, I say that on the basis that noble Lords should not underestimate the difficulties facing the Prison Service and the police. There is very considerable pressure on the capacity of the Prison Service, as noble Lords know. Now is not the time to debate why that is the case and the measures the Government are taking to address those pressures. However, it must be recognised that there are serious pressures and demands imposed on staff, and that the Prison Service has a difficult responsibility for managing those pressures in a way that is safe for staff and inmates. We should also not underestimate the considerable challenges the police face day to day in managing people coming into police custody. Noble Lords will be aware that because of the condition and demeanour of many of these people, this is a dynamic and occasionally volatile environment  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_557"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 557</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in which it is difficult to entirely eliminate risk. I know that the Prison Service, through the custody improvement programme and the publication of guidance on safer detention last year, is taking its responsibilities for those in its custody very seriously.</p>
<a name="time_6"></a>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0707232000125"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice said that there would be annual reports on progress towards commencing this part of the Bill, and there will be significant developments between now and when a report is produced next year. The review that the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, is undertaking on the supply and demand of prison places will have reported, and assessments will be available of the progress that police forces are making towards complying with the safer detention guidance issued in February last year.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0707232000126"></a>The exact timetable must be subject to further evaluation in light of these developments. It may therefore look more like the five years that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice referred to. However, I give the assurance that the Government will start out on this process with a timetable of three years in mind. In doing so, we will give careful consideration to the possibility of staged implementation. I very much hope that earlier progress could be made on some of the various forms of custody listed in Amendment No. 10R. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will feel able to support the Bill as it now stands.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0707232000127"></a>Writing a timetable into a Bill will set this in stone. I hope I have made it clear that there are significant issues about the extension of the offence, and that we are at the start of a process of applying the offence to custody. I have provided what I hope is real reassurance, setting an ambitious timetable that the Government will work towards. But, as noble Lords will recognise, we must be able to assess progress against that and see where things stand, and the annual report will enable noble Lords to see progress to date. I therefore hope that noble Lords will not seek to act further and fix the timetable in legislation.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0707232000128"></a>I very much hope that we are today at the end of our debates on this legislation. I am now in a position to put the Bill on the statute book. The Government have offered considerable further movement, and custody will now appear as an integral part of the offence. I have offered assurances about the timetable for commencing that part of the legislation. I hope your Lordships&#146; House will accept these commitments and not send the Bill back to another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0707232000131"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, like every other Member of this House, I am sure, I am immensely reassured by what the Minister has just told us. On many occasions in previous debates on this subject, Members of your Lordships&#146; House have paid tribute to her, not just for her willingness to engage in discussion with us but for the way she has represented the case in this House and, more importantly, within government and behind the scenes, as it were. I am sure she must have played a considerable part in enabling this satisfactory conclusion to be reached. I am sure we all pay great tribute to her.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0707232000132"></a>I also pay great tribute to the Secretary of State in another place, because he has changed his position considerably over the last four weeks, influenced, I am sure, by the noble Baroness. Nevertheless we have been given his assurance as well as hers, so it would be churlish to press for more. My reason for tabling this amendment was my concern that seven years was too long. It represented more than the life of this Parliament and probably the life of the next Parliament as well. As an ex-soldier, I could not help remembering that D-day was planned and executed in one-quarter of that time. I suspect that the complexities of the Bill are nothing compared with that operation.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0707232000133"></a>The noble Baroness rightly mentioned that there are things to be done and issues to consider with the police and prisons. Like me, my noble friend Lord Dear was delighted to hear what has happened. If possible, he will want to be involved in any discussions in which he can help to take the matter forward.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0707232000134"></a>It is right to recognise that this has been a long time in coming. When we last debated it, the noble Baroness said that she hoped that this would not be the way in which business was conducted and that discussion about such matters before they reached the Floor of the House was much more satisfactory. I agree, but it has been very interesting that this House has consistently stuck to this line without wavering. I am sure that victims up and down the country will be very glad of the outcome.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0707232000135"></a>I must admit that as a novice I am not sure of the procedure involved. Other Members may wish to speak. I think that it would perhaps be courteous and sensible to bid to withdraw my amendment.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0707232000140"></a>I am disappointed for a number of reasons. When I last looked at the figures, we had, on average, two deaths in custody per week. I am disappointed about the timescale&#151;that it will take another three years before we come to a conclusion on this matter. I am disappointed that in the mean time there will be this exemption; I will explain that. I am also disappointed for those who lost their dear ones through deaths in prison; with future deaths, others will have to wait even longer to reach a conclusion.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0707232000141"></a>Our stand has been clear from day one. A law that distinguishes between the private and public sectors&#151;or between the private sector and the private sector working in the public sector, as is the case with prisons&#151;is a bad law. There should be uniform application, but that is lacking. We thank the Minister for her assurance that the Government hope to put the situation right at the end of three years.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0707232000142"></a>I am also concerned about the prison population; that was one of the Minister&#146;s arguments. The prison population is increasing day by day in this country and I cannot see that in three years&#146; time we will be any better off than we are now. The problem will still be there. I also believe that, with the increase in terrorism in this country, accidents will happen, and there may be shootings. There should be some accountability about such deaths.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0707232000143"></a>I am disappointed by the long timescale involved. What are the interim plans within the three-year period? It would be helpful if the Minister explained that. We have gone as far as we can on this matter. If the noble Lord presses the amendment there will be further ping-pong, but I understand that he now intends to call it a day; we respect his wishes. If he had called a Division, we on this side would certainly have supported him. However, I promise that the matter will not end when this debate finishes. We will take every available opportunity, in Questions and short debates, to raise this issue until such time as it is on the statute books. Let common sense prevail: our shortcomings and rising prison population should not hinder progress in this very important matter.</p>

It is a moment for congratulating noble Lords on the way in which they have upheld the rule of law. The principle that all are equal in the eyes of the law should apply.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0707232000147"></a>Noble Lords are also to be congratulated on upholding the rights of those in custody and in the hands of the state. Often the most vulnerable in our society, they must be owed a duty of care. This is a partial victory, but by no means a Pyrrhic victory. We have ensured, through proper pursuit of a vital point of principle, that ours is a system that will ultimately submit itself to the same tests of competence and decency that it imposes on others.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0707232000148"></a>I share the frustration of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, at Amendment No. 10AA, in the Government&#146;s name, which still separates the implementation of different strands of the Bill. Whereas the Secretary of State confirmed in the other place that the various measures in the Bill will be implemented on 6 April next year, the application of the offence to deaths in custody remains out on a limb. Its introduction is not legally binding; it is not committed to in word or law. We have, however, had a number of key concessions. Mr Straw said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="0707232000348"></a>&#147;We have shifted; there is no question about that&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/7/07; col. 337.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="70723-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0707232000149"></a>Well, good on you, your Lordships. He went on to say that he very much hoped to implement these key provisions in less than the period of five to seven years.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0707232000150"></a>I thank the Minister for coming forward today and saying that the Government will work to a timescale of three years. However, this is still only an enabling power on the face of the Bill. I would be wrong not to express my disquiet about that. There are just under 100 provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 that remain neither enacted nor repealed, wholly or partially. It is sad but true that this Government have form on omitting to enact provisions in legislation. The Minister has persuaded us that she means business. It is her personal undertaking on this that I hold most dear and most valuable.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0707232000151"></a>It has been a difficult time. I can imagine the pressures that have been put on the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. He is a Cross-Bencher. Often in this House the Cross-Benchers take a key lead in putting forward a point of principle, and I congratulate him on the way in which he has taken forward this very important issue. He has constantly stressed the importance of recognising that, in enacting this legislation, the families of those who have been bereaved in these terrible circumstances are just as important as the families of those who have been bereaved in other circumstances.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0707232000152"></a>I am ever mindful of the wise words of my honourable friend in the other place, Dominic Grieve, who observed that the Government&#146;s response to private institutions that have found it difficult to convert to health and safety legislation in the past has been quite simply, &#147;Tough&#148;. Tough is exactly what I hope the Government will be: tough in the test that

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0707232000153"></a>In conclusion, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and to the other noble Lords who have supported him. Appropriately and deservedly, last week he was named and celebrated as Peer of the Year. Thanks to his vision, persistence and unflagging energy, justice will be done&#151;sadly, not today or tomorrow, but perhaps one day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0707232000155"></a>I am very grateful to the Lord President for the way in which she has spoken. If we are at the end of a process, that itself must be a good thing. However, she said one thing about which I should like to voice a word of concern. If I understood correctly, she said that one reason why it was important that we did not put a timetable into the Bill was that the service or services might have difficulty adjusting to what the Bill requires. If I heard her correctly, she went on to say that the concern was about not the senior levels of the service but the junior levels. When I heard her say that, I thought, &#147;Yes, I know what you mean, and it is what we often say, but it is an argument about which we should be extremely cautious&#148;. If, in some meeting of bishops, I catch myself saying that of course I agree with something but I could not possibly expect people back home to go along with it, I always know that I am on a difficult wicket.</p>

<a name="70723-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0707232000156"></a>The task of legislation and, if I may say so, of government and senior levels in the service is to set an ethos that is absolutely clear. If that happens, it enables change, but change does not happen if people at the lower levels of institutions suspect that secretly the people at the higher levels are not very committed to the change. Time and again, I have seen people of great vulnerability cared for in places only because a very clear policy has been set by the people in charge. I only hope that this possibility of delay is not wrongly attributed to people at a lower level but that we who have the opportunity to form an opinion about this matter make the ethos that we require absolutely clear. I am sure that that is true of the Lord President, but that form of argument needs to be noticed when it is brought into play.</p>

I make it clear that those who feel strongly that the Bill is important were well represented by noble Lords who felt equally strongly. I think particularly of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, but also of noble Lords from across your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0707232000158"></a>I was delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said that we had reached a very satisfactory conclusion, for I hope that today will mark the end of this part of the process and the beginning of what we need to do next. The noble Lord&#146;s disappointment about the timetable was echoed in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I know that it was felt that, although my right honourable friend the Secretary of State had put a timetable on this, that was some considerable time away. I hope that my words about an ambitious timetable of three years, which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State gave me to use today, will be well recognised as being what the Government seek to reach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0707232000159"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, also talked about discussion outside your Lordships&#146; House. I want to reiterate that one ambition of mine, as Leader of the House, is that we deal with many of these matters away from the Floor of the House, so that when they come to your Lordships we have had the benefit of such debate and discussion as can take us through some difficulties and, I hope, to some kind of conclusion. That will not always happen, but in my experience it has been a good way to conduct our business. I pay tribute to all noble Lords who have given me their time in order for me to understand fully their concerns and to enable me and others to reflect them in discussion with my right honourable friend and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0707232000160"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, is disappointed, but he will agree that the issue of deaths in custody will not be addressed by this legislation alone. Indeed, our debates during the passage of this Bill and on other legislation have shown the importance of trying to tackle effectively situations that may be about suicide or worse. The way to approach this legislation is to see it as part of a jigsaw puzzle, not the answer in itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0707232000161"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, mentioned interim plans. We have talked already about the annual report to your Lordships&#146; House and to another place. Discussions will begin, and I am mindful that noble Lords may wish to participate in those, at least initially; it is up to your Lordships how far to take that forward. I expect noble Lords to continue to debate this through questions in your Lordships&#146; House and in the other place and to represent the views of this House through making contact with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State, not least through my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, to whom the implementation of this will now fall in his capacity as a Minister. We could not do any better than to rest with him on that. We have put this in the Bill in this way partly to enable us, as I indicated, to stage implementation so that, as we are ready, we can come in even more quickly than my right honourable friend has indicated. I hope that noble Lords will see that as a useful way to address, at least in part, their disappointment and concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0707232000162"></a>I say to the right reverend Prelate that we have discussed the issue of being risk-averse many times in my dealings with this legislation. The second time that this legislation was received in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;in ping-pong, as we call it&#151;we discussed those feelings on health and safety questions. I will not go into those again; suffice it to say that I was not trying to suggest that the people on the ground floor, if I may put it like that, within the Prison Service or the police would be less likely to wish to see this legislation or, indeed, to participate in what will happen. We simply have to be mindful of the impact that any new legislation has on those on the front line who must implement it, and to be sure that we have set it out correctly and properly. Noble Lords will know that that applies in a whole range of areas, not least here. That was really the point that I was seeking to make, but clearly I did not make very well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0707232000163"></a>I hope that we are done with the Bill. There will be a great deal of support for this piece of legislation to make it on to the statute book.

The complaint is that prisoners arrive so late that it is often difficult to sort out who should go into which cell. They arrive late because the drivers of the vans are also court officials. They cannot start driving until the court has closed, which means that prisoners are delivered too late. That is because resources do now allow for two separate people to do two separate jobs. If that sort of complexity is going to be ironed out to make a better Prison Service and a better prison system, the stimulus of the Bill will have had another valuable purpose.

<a name="0707232000169"></a><b><a name="70723-0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0707232000499"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker):</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement currently being made by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the other place. The Statement is as follows:</p>
 &#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the serious flooding that occurred over the weekend.&#147;A band of rain swept across central and southern England on Friday, developing into intense rainstorms. In 24 hours, up to 160 mm, that is six and a half inches, of rain fell. With already saturated ground, this rapidly entered rivers and drainage systems, overwhelming them. &#147;Transport was severely disrupted, with the M5 and M50 affected and train services unable to run. Many local roads in flood-hit areas remain closed and the public are advised not to travel in the worst hit areas. &#147;The most serious flooding has been experienced across central England, and in particular in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. I must emphasise that this emergency is far from over and further flooding is very likely as the Thames and the Severn fill with flood waters from within their catchments.&#147;There are currently eight severe flood warnings in place, covering the Severn, the Thames and the Great Ouse in Bedford. Fifty other flood warnings are in place across England and Wales.&#147;We believe that up to 10,000 homes have been or could be flooded. Our thoughts are, of course, with all those whose lives have been so badly affected by the floods. In addition, up to 150,000 properties in the area including Tewkesbury, Gloucester and Cheltenham have lost, or risk losing, mains water following flooding of the Mythe water treatment works at Tewkesbury. This loss of water supply is serious and we do not expect houses to have service restored for some days. Severn Trent, the water company, is making provision for some 900 bowsers to be deployed and refilled by tankers, for those people without mains water. The company reports that about 240 bowsers are already in place and priority is being given to hospitals and vulnerable customers. &#147;Precautionary notices to boil water have also been issued in Sutton, Surrey, following rain water getting into treated water storage. Electricity supply is also a concern. A number of electricity sub-stations have been affected by flood water, and about 45,000 properties have lost power, including at Castle Mead  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_565"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and Tewkesbury. A major National Grid switching station at Walham, Gloucester, remains under threat, which could result in 200,000 additional properties or more losing their supply. This would have a knock-on effect on water supplies.&#147;Yesterday evening, Armed Forces personnel were drafted in to help fire service and Environment Agency staff to erect a kilometre-long temporary barrier around the site and to start pumping out 18 inches of flood water behind the barrier. So far, these defences are holding but the water is still rising, so it is touch and go. If it does flood, the National Grid will be used as far as possible, but properties in the affected area will lose power. Contingency planning is underway to ensure continuity of essential services and supplies. &#147;Last night, the Prime Minister chaired a meeting of COBRA and today he visited Gloucester. Other ministerial colleagues and I have also been to see the problems first hand, in my case visiting Worcester, Evesham and Gloucester yesterday.&#147;I am sure the whole House will wish to thank the emergency services, the Armed Forces, staff from the Environment Agency, local councils and the utilities, and others for the way in which they have worked together in implementing the emergency plans. I would also like to thank local communities for their huge effort in helping each other.&#147;Because this emergency continues, I would ask the public to listen out for flood warnings, particularly on local radio stations; to contact the Environment Agency floodline on 0845 9881188; to respond to advice about evacuation; and to look out for neighbours and anyone who may be vulnerable as a result of flooding, or loss of power and/or the water supply. People should not go into flood water and children should certainly not play in it. Even six inches of fast moving water can knock people off their feet, and the water will often be polluted or hide dangers. &#147;As the waters recede, the clear-up will begin. The revised Bellwin rules will assist local authorities in the areas affected to cover the immediate costs of dealing with the flooding and its aftermath, and the Government will now look at the support required for these areas. And we will also increase funding for flood defences to &#163;800 million by 2010-11, as I informed the House on 2 July.&#147;Finally, the review which I have set up to learn the lessons from the floods of this summer will, of course, look at what has happened over the past three days. I have decided that I will ask an independent person to oversee the review. I will keep the House informed of developments&#148;.

It is awful to have one&#146;s own home invaded, but of course a lot of businesses have been affected as well.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0707232000172"></a>We welcome the Prime Minister&#146;s review but there are some questions that I would like to ask. The Statement is brief. I do not mean that in a derogatory manner; it is as it is because it comes fairly soon after the emergency. The Statement clearly says that the Armed Forces were asked to help &#147;yesterday evening&#148;, which was Sunday. Why were they were not called out earlier? It seems strange that it has taken so long to do that.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0707232000173"></a>Secondly, of the money which is being put forward under the Bellwin rules to help flood defences in the future&#151;some &#163;800 million by 2010-11&#151;how much will be allocated immediately up front? I suspect that most of us hope that a lot of that money will be moved early, rather than waiting to be updated in later years. I presume that the money will go directly to local authorities, but what happens to individual households? Some will have insurance cover, but I am sure the noble Lord will accept that many have not. Again, I should like some clarification of the position because there is nothing in the report on it.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0707232000174"></a>I want to reflect on the position of the Environment Agency. It was featured in a National Audit Office report published in June which noted that only 57 per cent of all flood risk asset systems and 46 per cent of other high-risk systems, such as those protecting urban areas, had achieved their target condition by March of this year, with the potential risk that a flood could occur. What is the Government&#146;s reaction to that, and what pressure have they put on the Environment Agency to put its house in order? I also understand that because of Defra&#146;s financial difficulties earlier in the year, cuts were made to the Environment Agency&#146;s budget. Perhaps the Minister can clarify how much those cuts were worth, and when or if they have been restored. I turn to the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, who said that the upgrading programme requires &#163;1 billion each year. Can the Minister tell the House where this leaves us currently?</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0707232000175"></a>Our deepest sympathy goes to all the affected businesses, individuals and families, many of whom are not in their own homes and will not be for many months. It is a dreadful situation. Floodwater is bad enough, but foul water is quite something else. My heart bleeds for those families because it is not a happy situation. Given that a Defra Minister is repeating the Statement, can he tell us what is the anticipated strategy for providing help to farmers in the affected areas? Many farms have been totally flooded with loss of livestock in addition to ruined crops. Has any thought been given to this issue? Within that, I want to mention the work of the Farming Help Partnership, a voluntary body offering help and support for families in need as quickly as it can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0707232000176"></a>I come from the East Midlands region, which has not been quite as badly affected as the area around Tewkesbury and the West Midlands, but it has also been hit, particularly in Horncastle and Louth. When the earlier flooding occurred in Hull and north Yorkshire, why did Lincolnshire not receive any financial help  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_567"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 567</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when the other two areas did? I hope that in the allocation of moneys to local authorities, it will not be the case that some will be given money while others will get nothing. If no financial help is given to Lincolnshire this time, it will have been hit twice.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0707232000177"></a>Finally, I turn to the whole question of insurance cover. Many households have insurance cover for flooding, but a good number do not. Is the Minister in a position to tell the House how individual householders should go about seeking help? Will it come only from the Bellwin scheme or will the Government be making emergency money available to help them in the short term?</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0707232000178"></a>I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement and for pointing out that unfortunately the situation is ongoing. Two aspects of it are particularly worrying: first, dirty water is all around and there are shortages of fresh water, which should be made available to all households; secondly, I understand that part of the electricity supply has already been lost and more may well be disrupted if the water cannot be pumped out of one of the substations. Those are my specific concerns.</p>

I agree with virtually everything she has said, and would particularly like to register from these Benches our profound sympathy for the families, companies, individuals and farmers who are suffering from this flooding. Everyone is going through an awful time in those localities. If we are spared this flooding disaster personally, it is easy just to read about it in the papers and leave it at that, but it is a horrendous personal problem for people and we feel very deeply about the situation. This is the fourth Statement in recent times on flooding problems. It is the first time that it has been repeated in the Lords and we particularly welcome that. This will inevitably be an ongoing matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0707232000180"></a>Obviously it sounds trite if one starts to criticise the Government for weather conditions&#151;that would be most unfair; it is easier to criticise them for many of their domestic policies on a proper basis&#151;but in this case we have to register our great concern about the ongoing problems which seem to be arising. The obvious climatic differences from previous occasions need to be looked at, but of real concern here is the way in which the Government have dealt with these things on past occasions. It gives me no pleasure to say this but it has to be said: is the Minister ready to deal seriously with these problems and what are the Government going to do in their review?</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0707232000181"></a>It took the Government a long time to react to previous warnings, statements made by other people and ecological and weather experts in this country and elsewhere, and we can see the effects now in this country of the dire budget cuts that have taken place and the difficulties that they are causing to people. I have to say, again with regret, that the Government have failed to provide adequately for flood prevention,  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_568"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 568</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>despite warnings. They were warned on a number of occasions that there would be serious flood risks in the north, particularly, and maybe elsewhere. This time the floods seem to be more in central and southern England. Our fellow citizens in the north suffered very grievously on an earlier occasion and are still suffering from it. Why did not the Government therefore make proper efforts to tackle these matters and to liaise with all the various agencies, including the Environment Agency, to ensure that there was proper co-ordination?</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0707232000182"></a>We pay tribute to the community, voluntary and other organisations, and the Armed Forces, particularly, for what they have done in this recent emergency; it has been a magnificent effort. But the Government need to have forethought about these matters, and that was somewhat lacking on previous occasions. Despite the Government&#146;s promises two years ago to give the strategic overview of all flood risks to the Environment Agency, nothing has happened effectively. The responsibility for prevention and protection us against continued flooding remains split between councils, water companies and the Environment Agency, all of which operate on different scientific and quasi-scientific assessments of risk.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0707232000183"></a>I am sorry to say that the new Prime Minister must take some responsibility for the Government&#146;s flood failures as he cut the flood defence budget by &#163;14 million last summer; and it was only last month that his previous department asked the agency and the local flood boards to plan for real effective cuts for the next three years. Even after the Yorkshire floods, the Treasury only reluctantly conceded that the defence budget for flooding should be boosted by 2010 while saying very little about the next two years of the spending plans. My noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer asked a Private Notice Question on 27 June about the flooding, and that was the catalyst that caused the Government to respond.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0707232000184"></a>While we on these Benches feel disappointed, we thank the Government for the emergency measures they are taking now. We need further drastic action and much more reassurance from the Government in general. I should like a further update, if possible, from the Minister on the Ulley reservoir. What does he intend to do to provide immediate remedial action to help people, particularly those in danger of electricity cuts, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, referred, and the danger of repeat flooding, about which experts have warned, in these areas during the coming days and weeks?</p>

I shall do my best to answer the questions but let us get this clear: it is said in the Statement that the situation will get worse today and tomorrow as the rivers rise; anything I say could be overturned within an hour and so it is not possible to be specific. There are thousands of people out there working their socks off trying to protect the power stations, the transmission stations, and trying to pump out and get the water treatment plant working

Obviously that is vital. But, at the same time, the weather forecast is not good, the surge has not completely diminished and there are severe flood warnings on the Thames. So things can change dramatically. But I will give a commitment that Parliament will be updated. This is an awkward week, as it is the last one before Recess, but we will do our best to update.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0707232000186"></a>So far as the request for troops is concerned, the noble Baroness must appreciate that the Gold Command structure was set up long ago, and it was at Gold Command&#146;s request that the troops were called in. One has to leave it to the police, who are in overall charge of emergency services. The military liaison officers were present in Gold Command from the beginning, and obviously reacted when a request was made. I cannot be specific about the discussions that took place before that because I do not know, but that system is tried and tested and it works.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0707232000187"></a>I have to knock on the head again the allegations about the Environment Agency budget. The &#163;14 million, out of the roughly &#163;500 million budget, was nothing to do with defence work. That was last year&#146;s budget, and it was replaced in this year&#146;s budget with even more money. That was not a capital programme. No flood defence work was stopped for it. The capital programme&#151;&#163;600 million, from memory&#151;is more than what it was eight or nine years ago, when it was &#163;200 million or so. We have said we will put it up to &#163;800 million. The noble Baroness put that in with the Bellwin rules, but it is nothing to do with those figures; it is the capital flood defence programme that we have already announced for Environment Agency work.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0707232000188"></a>The Bellwin rules were that 85 per cent of the extra expenditure necessary for local authorities is provided. That has been changed to 100 per cent, as the Prime Minister said over the weekend. I cannot be specific about the money that local authorities will get, but clearly we have to review their funding, as was said following the floods in the north when extra money, over and above Bellwin, was made available. The reduction in the Environment Agency budget was for some repair work, but I emphasise that it was &#163;14 million. It would not have made the slightest difference to the current situation, and it was not part of the capital programme for flood defences, which was not cut; indeed, it has been increased over the period of this Government.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0707232000189"></a>Last week, on a visit, the Secretary of State said that he would relax the cross-compliance rules for farmers on request for those who needed to use, for example, set-aside land. We will be actively looking at considering that in relation to the whole of England and will consider how the regulations work and whether there should be any other necessary relaxations to assist farmers. One cannot tell at present what is needed. We know what crops were in the fields and it is true that many will be devastated, some more than others. We will do our best to help farmers, who are very practical people in any event.</p>

<a name="70723-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0707232000190"></a>I was asked about the co-ordination of flood emergencies. They are co-ordinated, as are other emergencies, by Gold and Silver commands, led by the

That system works well. The Government have set out a strategic overview role for the Environment Agency. We have the stated procedures, which we will be reviewing. There is no doubt that there are lessons to be learnt from the past there days, as from three weeks ago.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70723-0005.htm"/>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0707232000191"></a>I regret that I cannot say anything about families and insurance. It is far too early for me to say anything about what has happened in the past three days in that respect. I understand that, in the area that has been flooded in central England, fewer properties have been affected than in the north a few weeks ago and that there is a greater propensity for properties to be insured in that part of the world. I do not have specific figures. I saw some graphs and charts early this morning, but it is too early to say at present.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0707232000192"></a>The floods in central England are, by current calculations, worse than those in 1947. What is more, in 1947 they came in winter when one expects flooding, with the rain and the snow off the hills. Here we are in the middle of summer, when one cannot reasonably expect all this. This was not rain coming off the Welsh hills down into the Severn; it was six and a half inches of rain dropping across central England. London got a taste of it on Friday, but that was nothing like what fell on the rest of the country.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0707232000193"></a>As for warnings, I fully accept what the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, said, but I can remember standing at this Dispatch Box a few months ago, giving a report about the fact that we had had no rain in April. I was assuring the House that the reservoirs and aquifers were full and that we did not foresee having standpipes. I was got at in the Corridor outside by noble Lords saying, &#147;You&#146;ve really put your head on the block there, sonny. Are you really sure we&#146;ll have enough water?&#148;. Some of the forecasts were of a long, dry, hot summer. With no rain in April, we were thinking there would be serious trouble&#151;and then we end up with the wettest June on record. I fully admit that all kinds of warnings have been given, but with what happened on Friday, no warnings and no amount of work following them would have assisted. I understand that the barrier at Upton upon Severn could not get there; if it had been there, it would have been overwhelmed this time, unlike the last time it was used. I appreciate that that is no comfort to the people in Upton upon Severn.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0707232000194"></a>I mentioned Lincolnshire in the list of counties and we accept that it has been affected. It would be unfair if a county was caught twice and missed out twice; we will take that factor into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0707232000195"></a>I am not in a position to go into detail about the National Audit Office report. It was a follow up to the one in 2001; it was checking, and the Public Accounts Committee took advice from the noble Baroness and others. I think that it has yet to report.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0707232000196"></a>The key aspects of the emergency are supplies of clean water and electricity. Your house being flooded is one thing, but no water&#151;in the taps, for the toilets, to wash with&#151;and no electricity is serious. This is of the utmost importance. In the mean time, the companies are supplying water to locations which everyone will know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0707232000197"></a>I reinforce what was said in the Statement. People should first contact the Environment Agency&#146;s Floodline and, above all, they should listen to their local radio station. National radio stations are no use for local information. I was caught on Friday, like a lot of others, and Radio Oxford and Radio Gloucestershire gave me, and all the thousands I was stuck with, massive amounts of good, practical information. That is used by the police to feed information to people so that they can react. People should look in on neighbours they may not have seen, help out with the water situation and give comfort. If the electricity is off, they should make sure that before it is switched on again, things are safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0707232000200"></a>I join those who have expressed sympathy for everyone who has suffered the appalling disaster of having their homes flooded. But in my view, it is very unwise, even for&#151;perhaps especially for&#151;Members of Parliament rushing to score brownie points with their constituents to criticise public bodies such as the Environment Agency without knowing all the facts. Having had to deal with situations during my time, although not quite as bad as this, I offer my congratulations to the Environment Agency on the sometimes heroic work that it has carried out and the conscientious way in which it has done so. While we may, when we examine its record, find that some mistakes were made, I think its overall performance has been entirely to its credit.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0707232000201"></a>My noble friend Lady Byford spoke about the condition of assets and asked what pressure had been put on the Environment Agency to put its house in order. I am afraid that I would put the question rather differently: what pressure has been put on the Government to put their house in order in funding the Environment Agency, not on the capital budget, to which the noble Lord referred in some detail, but on the maintenance budget? My understanding is that the Environment Agency pressed hard for additional funding for the maintenance of existing facilities.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0707232000202"></a>When people look at the performance of the Environment Agency, they are understandably unaware of the many areas where flooding has been avoided because of the work that has been carried out in constructing schemes. I cite, for example, the Thames, where flooding would have been much worse but for the construction of the project there.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0707232000203"></a>Probably the most important single lesson to come out of this is that you must build neither housing nor infrastructure in the flood plain. That is primarily what we suffering from; we will have more flooding of this kind until that lesson is learnt. As I am being urged to sit down at this point, I may rise to press that point again when we come to the housing Statement that will follow.</p>

He is quite right that it is unwise to hurry criticism. Plenty of people can be subject to criticism in due course, after we have had a mature look at what has happened. I reinforce his tribute to the water engineers and the electrical engineers, who have worked their socks off anyway, particularly in emergencies. They are the people on whom we rely and they are doing a very good job.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0707232000205"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the maintenance budget. To the best of my knowledge, flooding in less than 1 per cent of areas is as a result of a structural failure of flood defences. Even the NAO found that the flood defences that are in place are maintained to a very high level. There has been structural failure in only about 1 per cent of flooded areas. Those defences in place have worked extremely well, although I accept that there are not enough of them.</p>

The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester, who is sitting beside me, and I are between us responsible for a fair amount of the flooding, so some people would like to think. However, they happen in our patch. I therefore pay tribute particularly to the others who are not often named. If it were not for volunteers, our society would collapse at times like this. I think of St John Ambulance, the Salvation Army, the Red Cross and so on. It is important that tribute be paid to them, who are helping at this very moment.

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0707232000207"></a>Perhaps I may make a point from three weeks&#146; experience of the flooding. We are beginning to pick up some of the pieces in Sheffield and look towards what might happen in the future. On Friday evening of this week, it will be the Forfeit Feast in Sheffield, where the Master Cutler hosts a reception and a great feast for the Lord Mayor of London and others. The Master Cutler has a small business, built in the flood plain, but several feet above the record level of any flood damage in the history of Sheffield. He has lost in his small business all his 150 motors, which have to be dismantled and dried out. He does not know when he will get back in business; the likelihood is that he will not. Therefore, his small business and many others will go under. Sheffield Forgemasters has lost &#163;20 million already through lost business. Coupled with the strength of the pound many manufacturers in our part of the world will perhaps be permanently damaged by what has happened in the past few weeks. It is my hope that, in these emergencies, the Government will think well enough in advance about what might happen.</p>

The motorway was jammed and it was dark, so you could not see what was happening. But there has been a massive contribution from the sectors. I cannot comment on businesses.

<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_575"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 575</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70723-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0707232000225"></a>I start with a group of amendments designed to pose a simple question. The Minister will know from our debate at Second Reading that, in the eyes of many of us, the over-riding defect of this part of the Bill is that it appears to have been put together by a cryptologist. From reading it, it is impossible to decipher what on Earth it all means. The Minister clearly knows what it means and we may think we know as a result of all the background material and Explanatory Notes.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0707232000226"></a>As a starting point, it is worth asking this very simple question: should not part of the aim of all legislation, including this Bill, be to be comprehensible in its own right? We understand that, arising from the Bill, there will be new bodies called local involvement networks or LINks. It is understood that the function of LINks will be analogous to that of patient forums, except that the LINks will extend to social care. Certain members of LINks will be authorised to perform certain functions. While the exact form and membership of LINks will be up to local determination and, therefore, are not to be laid down in the Bill, we can safely say that LINks will, at least, have members.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0707232000227"></a>But when we read the Bill, what do we find? We find that we are led around in a kind of dance, the aim of which is to go to fantastic lengths to avoid making any sort of descriptive reference to local involvement networks, to avoid any mention of their functions or powers and to omit all reference whatever to the fact that they are supposed to have members. Instead, in Clause 222 we have &#147;arrangements&#148;, along with &#147;activities&#148;. We do not have members of LINks; we have people. LINks are not even given any powers. The powers of LINks are only visible, as it were, in the mirror because they take the form of other people having duties in relation to LINks. Indeed, LINks are not bodies at all. The only clue as to what a LINk is comes in Clause 223(2), where we are told:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="0707232000352"></a>&#147;In this section, a reference to a &#145;local involvement network&#146; is to a person&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000309"></a>That reference to a person is the nearest we ever get to a definition of a LINk in the Bill. But who on Earth refers to a network as a person? A &#147;person&#148; is not a word that makes any sense in this context at all; it may make sense to a lawyer, but who in the ordinary world can understand it? I do not think that any of this language is helpful. I ask the Minister why we have this rigmarole. Why can we not have, as the amendments propose, a definition of a LINk, however loose, on the face of the Bill, together with clear statements about its functions?</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07072327000001"></a>There is a serious point here about accountability. Many of us will have seen the press report last week telling us that the Government intend to reduce the number of central targets for the health service and to make local bodies responsible for setting their own targets. That is fine, but what follows is more local accountability, and patient and public involvement in the planning and delivery of healthcare is a terribly important part of what we mean by local accountability.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0707232000228"></a>What are the mechanisms for delivering it? As far as I can make out, it is not even going to be a contract. The arrangements referred to in Clause 222 are arrangements not with a LINk but with somebody  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_576"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 576</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>else&#151;namely, a host organisation. If the mechanisms for delivering patient and public involvement do not include having independent statutory bodies with defined functions, and if LINks themselves are not subject to a contract, how can we truly say that we are setting up a system that delivers robust local accountability? I believe that it is very difficult.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0707232000229"></a>In her letter of 9 July, the Minister confirmed that we cannot prejudge what LINks will look like. As with a creature from Lewis Carroll, we may know a LINk when we see it, but we cannot, for the moment, define one. Whatever LINks seem to be, we see from the Bill that they will not have functions. If we cannot define a LINk and it does not have functions, the obvious questions arise. How will it be able to enforce its rights in law and, from the opposite perspective, how will people be able to enforce a complaint against a LINk about what it is or is not doing, and on what legal basis?</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0707232000230"></a>I do not know whether the Minister can give us any satisfactory answers to all that. The point is not just that the Bill is vague but that it does not appear to deliver a sound basis for what most of us think patient and public involvement should truly be. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="0707232000231"></a><b><a name="70723-0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0707232000516"></a>Baroness Neuberger:</b> I support very strongly the words of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. Since I think that we agree on everything, I just want to add a little more weight to what he has said. Perhaps it is good for the Minister to hear that, across the Cross Benches, the Conservative Benches, the Lib Dem Benches and some of the Labour Benches, we are united in some of our concerns about this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0707232000232"></a>When we first saw the Bill, many of us were deeply concerned because we could not find any clarity in it; we could not work out what it really meant. However, as the weeks have passed, we have learnt more about, for instance, what the early adopters of the LINk model were doing. I was truly shocked that they were given a set of objectives that asked them to focus on particular aspects&#151;this is from evidence that was given by Meredith Vivian to the Health Select Committee&#151;without a clear list of duties.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0707232000233"></a>So much of it, in everything that we could find, was process driven. It was all about,</p>
<ul><a name="0707232000357"></a>&#147;how we can make sure we reach as many people as possible and are as engaged as possible with voluntary community sectors, how we can make sure that what we do is well-known in terms of communication and visibility&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000311"></a>But what the objectives are remains, to most of us, singularly unclear.</p>

<a name="70723-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0707232000234"></a>It is not just me saying that. The Health Select Committee, in its report, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="0707232000353"></a>&#147;The &#145;early adopter&#146; projects appear less an objective trial than a discussion with stakeholders, and a key point&#151;what can be expected from Hosts&#151;is not being addressed&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000312"></a>It went on to recommend full trials of LINks to assess the practical requirements for running them. Indeed, it listed evidence from Elizabeth Manero of Health Link, suggesting that a model for LINks would be the best practices of the patient forums, where a core group will perhaps run the LINk,</p>
<ul><a name="0707232000358"></a>&#147;make decisions about the LINks activities, can sit in on trusts&#146; boards and meetings, and undertake surveys or visits. They produce reports and challenge trusts if they are unhappy with the response&#148;.</ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000313"></a>Her worry about LINks, as presently imagined, was that,</p>
<ul><a name="0707232000359"></a>&#147;the proposal is to have a very, very large, &#145;perhaps thousands of people&#146;, involved in the Health Service&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000314"></a>She continued that she was worried that this focused on a process rather than on refining an outcome.</p>
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="70723-0006.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="0707232000407"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0707232000236"></a>I already had real concerns about all this, as did many members of forums who have contacted me separately and together in the past few weeks. But my concerns have been strengthened considerably during the past week. The Minister kindly sent all of us involved in the Second Reading debate the drafts of two guidance documents for the establishment of LINks. The first was the model contract specification and the second was a document that sets out,</p>
<ul><a name="0707232000360"></a>&#147;what we expect an effective LINk would look like, based on what we have learned so far from the work of the Early Adopter Project sites, as well as from other networks in the community&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000315"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for sending us this material, but the second document made me almost lose the will to live. It is, indeed, all about process&#151;what it will be like&#151;including a rather offensive list of what it will not be like. The document states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="0707232000355"></a>&#147;A LINk is not ... a group of volunteers who are solely responsible for inspecting NHS and social care premises and services ... a method of performance managing health and social care services ... a method of dealing with individual complaints about local care services ... a network that duplicates other networks and initiatives&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000316"></a>and so on. That list is, rather, a suggestion that forums have not lived up to expectations and that they are somewhat like these theoretical groups that LINks are not to be.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0707232000237"></a>The real clue lies in the statement that the detail of the powers of LINks will be provided in the future regulations that the Government intend to consult on in the autumn. There is no clarity, just the suggestion that,</p>
<ul><a name="0707232000361"></a>&#147;LINks have a role in ... promoting and supporting the involvement of people in the commissioning, provision and scrutiny of local health and social care services ... obtaining the views of people about their need for, and experiences of, local health and social care services ... enabling people to monitor and review the commissioning and provision of care services ... making their views known to the people responsible for commissioning, providing, managing and scrutinising those services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000317"></a>We are then told:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="0707232000356"></a>&#147;This will be achieved by establishing a flexible framework, which can be tailored in each area&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000318"></a>according to local circumstances. There follows a series of diagrams from early adopters&#151;Kensington and Chelsea, and Durham. While I could understand Kensington and Chelsea&#146;s simple membership diagram and begin to comprehend its more complicated model of how it would work with no central hub membership, the Durham model left me wholly baffled. In each case, the text tells us that the models are under development. I am not surprised. This way of thinking  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_578"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 578</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is absurd. The first decision must be about the objectives, powers and duties of LINks. What are they to do? What must they do? What can they do? Only then should this discussion of process even begin.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0707232000238"></a>This has seemed to me to show that the Department of Health is more concerned with process in this area than outcome and is more concerned with breaking down the present structure of patient forums than developing them and creating a smooth transition into LINks. It is not concerned about creating a huge cadre of disaffected volunteers, who will look at all this and ask, quite sensibly, what it really means. For those reasons and many others, I strongly support this group of amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="0707232000239"></a><b><a name="70723-0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0707232000517"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> I, too, support this group of amendments, particularly Amendment No. 238LF. I received an e-mail about the Bill at the weekend, which pointed out that as things stand, since local involvement networks have no independent legal personality, their members could be personally liable for their actions, even though they are discharging statutory functions. This contrasts sharply with the present position whereby patients&#146; forums are legal entities.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0707232000240"></a>Amendment No. 238LF changes the definition of a LINk in Clause 223(2) from a person carrying on the activities specified in Clause 222(2) to,</p>
<ul><a name="0707232000362"></a>&#147;a body set up in pursuance of the arrangements specified in&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0707232000319"></a>Clause 222(1). The amendment, therefore, would change LINks from groups of persons coalescing around a particular function or set of functions to a corporate legal entity. I submit that this is a much more satisfactory situation for the members of these local involvement networks and I believe, therefore, that this constitutes an ungainsayable argument for inserting Amendment No. 238LF into the Bill.</p>

What really concerns us is that we have no real conception of what the future holds. The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, has spelt it out extremely well.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0707232000242"></a>I have to admit that I have another worry. It seems extraordinary that this Bill has been going on for so long now in the background without coming to Parliament. The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health has been extended about nine times since it began. That is a fairly extraordinary figure. We have heard from some of the earlier doctors that very good work has been going on with more or less the same members as exist in the forum. I find it really rather upsetting that, even if the time has come to say goodbye finally to the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, nobody has thanked it for the work that it has done. Considering it was set up and abolished almost at once, it was a pretty disturbing commission to have been in charge of and to have been on the staff of. I would like the Minister to take this opportunity to say something rather more positive than we have heard so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="0707232000243"></a>There are obviously reasons for moving in this direction, particularly on the social care side, as I understand it, which cannot so easily be joined with the health side. I believe that the health side is rather bossy and dominant. It will take some persuading that we will have a sufficiently strong social care side for them to be on a par and in partnership; many other Bills put through by the Government rightly aimed to achieve partnerships at all social levels. I just wanted to say that, by way of a background to my concerns. I did not take part at Second Reading because of other commitments later in the day but I was there for most of the time and I have followed, as far as I can, what has been going on since.</p>

What Members of this House have said today bears out what they felt. Members of health forums have been treated very badly. These are volunteers. They need support, not putting down.

I say that having talked to some ordinary folk who regretted the loss of their community health councils, but continued stalwartly to join patient forums&#151;I declare an interest as a rather distant member of the St Thomas&#146;s forum&#151;and would like to continue to work in these areas. They do not understand two things, the first of which is about governance. How do these strange bodies, which are so ill defined, fit into the total governance structure of the health service? Do they have any power? Are they just sounding boards? What is their value? How will they be appreciated and understood?

That may be my lack because I was not able to engage in Second Reading or listen to all of it, although I read a certain amount. I understood the community health councils; the Government may not have liked what some of those groups did in terms of challenging issues in the health service. I have begun to understand&#151;just about&#151;what the patient forums were doing. I cannot understand what LINks are going to do. I am afraid that, even after listening very carefully to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, who usually illuminates me, I still do not understand&#151;probably because he does not know either&#151;what the organisations, bodies or people will do. I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister. A great deal depends on this in relation to local involvement, particularly, as my noble friend Lady

It would be a great help if local communities could understand LINks. If they cannot understand the structures, they will never understand the services.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0707232000249"></a>I am challenged by the &#147;enigma code&#148; version of the Bill proposed by the noble Earl. I am happy to do what I can to decrypt the Bill. I hope to inspire noble Lords to have confidence in where we are and why we are there. We give additional information in the hope of clarifying and supporting people&#146;s understanding. Given what has been said, it might be useful if I give a bit of background about why we have come up with this formulation.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0707232000250"></a>The amendments explore our changes and why we made them, the relation between the host and the LINk and the form and function of what is planned. Those issues go to the heart of what we are trying to do. I understand what noble Lords are saying about the absence of a statement of objectives at the front of the Bill. We have that debate over and over again in the House; we had it recently on mental health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0707232000251"></a>I refer noble Lords to the Minister&#146;s foreword to <I>Creating an Effective LINk</I>, a draft document which has been circulated. It can be summed up very simply: the establishment of local involvement networks gives communities the chance to influence all health and social care services. Whether they are run by councils or the NHS, LINks will give citizens the chance to have their say in a much wider range of ways, which I will come to discuss later. It may be, for example, by investigation or commissioning reports that will be put together by a much wider range of participants than has ever been possible before, because of the extension to social care. It may be through the &#147;enter and view&#148; function, which is very clear in the Bill. It could be by gathering voices to exert greater influence on a particular decision in the local health service.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0707232000252"></a>Part 14 is not a convenient afterthought; it is brought forward from a genuine conviction that there must be better and less exclusive and forbidding ways for people to exert influence over health and social care in all areas of communities and to become more involved in what matters most to them. The substance of Part 14 is to put forward those more extensive and inclusive ways of involving the widest range of people to influence and improve healthcare. This debate has a long history; noble Lords around the Chamber will have engaged in it.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0707232000253"></a>I know that change is not comfortable; neither is acknowledging that what served once has been overtaken by different imperatives, but that is part of the debate that we are having. The first thing that I want to say, particularly to the noble Baronesses, Lady Masham and Lady Howe, is that I thank those who have served on patients&#146; forums for their work. The Minister thanks them in the foreword to the document; they have been  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_581"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 581</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thanked in different ways. Without their expertise and commitment, which have been built up and demonstrated, we would have a far worse health service. They have performed an extremely important function, so much so that we are determined that that expertise will not be lost, devalued or wasted. As I explained, as we go through the amendments, we want passionately to build on the best of what has been achieved and, indeed, to extend it.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0707232000254"></a>It is important to stress that these requirements are in this Bill because they belong here. First, their new role in local government will go far beyond the notion of a traditional delivery service, taking local authorities to the threshold of a new role in which they will shape the whole local environment&#151;the place in which people live, work and thrive. In terms of health, that is expressed first in the new duty that we propose for local authorities to put in place an independent structure to empower local people. Secondly, the Bill will enable services to work together in ways that have eluded us so far, closing gaps between social care and health in the design and delivery of services. Thirdly, the Bill breaks new ground in healthcare by finding a way to involve local people in providing services that go far beyond the interrogation of institutions, which is what the patients&#146; forum specialised in. They therefore go beyond the expertise of a small and dedicated group. The Bill goes into the wider community, across the entire patient journey and the experiences people have as part of that long journey.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0707232000255"></a>I know that noble Lords are asking, &#147;Why this Bill?&#148; and &#147;Why now?&#148;. In the past five years, the landscape of healthcare has changed, and it continues to change. The institutions have changed; foundation trusts and primary care trusts have changed; the configuration of PCTs and the patterns of provision have changed. Healthcare is offered in different ways and places. Priorities have changed; people have changed. Patients have become far more used to choice and far more used to being heard. System regulation has become more sophisticated. We have the wherewithal, capacity and vision to join up services. The health service role of overview and scrutiny committees has changed. I could go on.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0707232000256"></a>Just as the system for health and social care has changed, the opportunities must change so that local people can shape the services that they experience. I am not saying that patients&#146; forums failed, but the context and demands on services changed and the remit of the patients&#146; forums was narrow: they covered only health; they focused on institutions; they were very inflexible; and they were inextricably linked in legislation with the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. That was determined centrally, so what they did and how they were made up, supported and funded was all set out in legislation. That is why we have come forward with a proposal which, I believe, provides the security of a legal framework and guarantees that an independent organisation&#151;a host&#151;will have a way of collecting and amplifying the voices of people who might otherwise not be heard.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="0707232000257"></a>At all levels of the system we have built in accountability between the local authority and the host in terms of the contract&#151;the host is the servant  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_582"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 582</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of LINks, much as officials serve Ministers&#151;and between LINks themselves and the wider community. I am sure that we will explore that in due course.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0707232000258"></a>For very good reason, we have not put in the Bill details about the form that a LINk might take, although its functions are set out clearly in Clause 222. We have not included those details because that ties in with the culture of the change that we are trying to make and because in the consultation that preceded the Bill it was made clear that local people wanted to decide the form of the organisation and to determine the scope of the network and its membership and governance arrangements.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0707232000259"></a>Amendments Nos. 238KBB, 238KCA and 238LF would put a duty on the local authority to establish a LINk directly rather than through the procurement of a host. Having set out the context, I hope that the Committee will recognise that I appreciate the sentiment behind that aim and the fact that noble Lords are searching for an explanation of this structure. I also fully appreciate the difficulties that can be brought about by a lack of detail in the Bill. Many Bills are icebergs: all the interesting stuff is underneath and the legislation has to be interpreted in different ways. I can see the attraction of putting in a definition of an organisation with legal substance and form; apart from anything else, it would seem to give noble Lords a degree of security that a tangible organisation would emerge. However, I stress that, in not doing that, we are not being perverse; we propose that a LINk should be created as a result of a contractual arrangement not so as to weaken, lessen the impact of or sideline a LINk and not because we think that it is a better philosophical model. Above all, we are taking this approach because, given the new relationship between a local authority and a local area, we need a means of ensuring that the LINk is separate from the local authority.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0707232000260"></a>A fundamental premise of patient and public involvement is that arrangements must be independent. I can understand the desire to simplify arrangements by cutting out the need for a host, but the host will perform a critical function: it will support independence. Without that arm&#146;s-length body holding the budget, facilitating the early stages of forming the network&#151;I shall come later to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth&#151;and enabling LINk members to generate a common agenda and distinguish priorities, the LINk might become no more than a reflection of or extension of the local authority. These amendments would reverse that principle by creating a LINk which, I fear, could become a creature of a local authority. That is why we are trying to build in independence.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0707232000261"></a>Perhaps I may write to the noble Lord, Lord Low, on his question about the limited liability company. That was an interesting point, but I cannot answer it from the Dispatch Box.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="0707232000262"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked why there was not more substance, with more detail about form and functions, in the Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, said that it is all about process. I hope that I have set out the reasons why the objectives are clear. The process is there to deliver objectives, and we are doing this to expand opportunities for people to have a  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_583"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 583</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>greater say over their health and care. I was asked why, for example, we cannot substitute the word &#147;functions&#148; for &#147;activities&#148; in the Bill. They are described as activities because they allow a LINk to have some discretion, whereas &#147;functions&#148; suggests that they would be mandatory. We refer to people in the Bill, rather than to LINks themselves, because LINks are collections of people&#151;collectives, in a way. A LINk has no set definition; we will talk about that in a moment. The legislation does not describe what LINks should do, because we want them to make their own judgments about what is more important for their areas.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="0707232000263"></a>In framing the legislation, we have tried to reflect the need for flexibility and autonomy. I understand the frustration, but this is a better way forward. The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, referred to two of the three diagrams at the back of the report; one is definitely more complicated than the other, but that has been a local choice. Sometimes democracy is complicated and diverse; indeed, I can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, that it is sometimes very worrying. Yet if we give people the power to choose what to prioritise, they will come up with some hard choices that will challenge the local health and care services.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="0707232000264"></a>There are different models in development. One LINk could have a host that provides all the staffing and support that we could think of, while another may say, &#147;No, just hold our funds. We want to employ our own staff&#148;, and it will be able to do that. In either case, the network of participants will decide. One reason for this determination is that we did not want to repeat past mistakes. Over the past few years, officials at the DoH have received countless requests for clarification about the legislation surrounding PPI forums&#151;whether they can do this or that. Usually, the answer has been no because the legislation has not allowed them to. We wanted to avoid that so, for now, abstract and enigmatic though it may be, we are providing the chance for LINks to be created in ways that are relevant to people and places.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="0707232000265"></a>I will briefly flesh out the bones before I finish. LINks will create coherent arrangements for governance, more likely comprising a small group of people and user organisations as their heart and soul. LINks will have a clear identity, with known contact points. Once it is contracted, the host will first map out who is liable to want to join in the area&#151;some local authorities have already begun that process. As well as the usual organisations, such as self-help groups and so on, there could be youth organisations, for example, because there are issues regarding youth health. LINks will be able to relate directly to NHS and social care organisations and to enter and view premises. Noble Lords will see that in Clause 225. LINks will be able to request information, to make reports and recommendations, and to receive a response. Critically, they will be able to refer matters of concern to the relevant overview and scrutiny committee. These important powers and functions are clearly laid out, and we think that they score highly on those grounds.</p>

<a name="70723-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="0707232000266"></a>I hope that I have been able to provide some reassurance. Clearly, it is a starting point for the rest of our debates on the detail. I hope that noble Lords

In these amendments, I was trying to pin down a sense of what legal identity, if any, LINks would have. I am puzzled by that because while the Bill tells us that a local involvement network is a person, we are told that it cannot be a statutory body. It seems an odd contradiction to state in the Bill that a LINk is a person while we are told that it has no legal identity. Can the Minister clarify that, before we go further?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="0707232000272"></a>The vagueness in the wording of this part of the Bill is in danger of letting down the Government. Let us look at the word &#147;activities&#148;. It struck me on reading this that there may be nothing to prevent more than one LINk in a local authority area. It would be possible, for example, for a host to support several bodies calling themselves LINks in a particular area, rather than just one. I do not think that is what the Government have in mind. It would be extremely undesirable and confusing to have more than one LINk in a local authority area. The Bill appears to allow for it. Do the Government want to rule out that possibility? If so, why does the Bill not do so?</p>

I am fairly certain that, by definition, we do not want to see more than one LINk because the area should be coterminous with the local area.

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="0707232000274"></a>On the legal point, like all voluntary organisations it is possible for a LINk to form itself into a company limited by guarantee, and even in due course to set itself up as a charity. Therefore it can have a legal status, rather than just being a completely amorphous collection of people. That goes some way in identifying the legal profile.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="0707232000276"></a>I confess I was puzzled by some of the other things the noble Baroness said. She said that if we try to include functions in the Bill, the language of functions would mean that whatever we included in the Bill would be mandatory. I am not sure that that is a show-stopper. If we believe that these bodies should have functions then why should we not say so? We need to reflect carefully on that.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="0707232000277"></a>The point about accountability and powers is a key part of all this. If an organisation has no powers conferred on it in statute, and not even any direct contractual obligations, it is very difficult to see how it can be part of a chain of accountability for local public services. It will amount to being no more than a talking shop. That is what some of us suspect LINks may turn into. A suspicious mind before this debate might have believed that that is what the Government were hoping to set up by means of the Bill, but I take the noble Baroness&#146;s word that it is not.</p>

&#147;I start by supporting the Statement of my right honourable friend and joining the many members of the House who have expressed their sympathy to the thousands of families whose lives have been turned upside down by the unprecedented flooding affecting wide parts of the country.&#147;The Government is publishing today its housing Green Paper, setting out proposals to deliver the homes Britain urgently needs today and for the future. &#147;The House should be proud of the huge steps this country has taken since 1997&#151;a two-thirds cut in rough sleeping; &#163;20 billion investment in social housing that has helped lift over a million children out of cold or poor conditions; and economic stability that has given over one million more people

But we also need to respond to new challenges. Demand for homes to buy or rent is growing faster than supply, and homes are becoming less affordable as a result. Already many first-time buyers rely on the help of friends or family to get a foot on the ladder. It simply is not fair that your chance of owning your home should depend so much on whether your parents or grandparents did before you. Nor is it fair that children are growing up in overcrowded or temporary accommodation, waiting for a settled home. Without further action, housing could become one of the greatest sources of social inequality in the next 20 years. &#147;In addition, we need to respond to the challenge of climate change. Our homes account for more than a quarter of national carbon emissions. We must provide greener, better designed housing for the future. As recent events have highlighted, it is absolutely vital to take steps to protect all our communities from flooding, and from the consequences of climate change in future. In the face of these three challenges, we propose strong action.&#147;First, we will build more homes to meet growing demand. The level of house building is at its highest for 17 years, but it is not enough. Moreover, without firm action there is no guarantee that growth will continue, as short-term market pressures mean some developers have slowed starts this year.&#147;We believe that a total of 3 million new homes are needed by 2020, and we will deliver 2 million of these by 2016. This will include new homes in the north as well as the south, as every region is seeing demand outstrip supply. In more areas we need additional affordable homes alongside areas of housing market renewal.&#147;Already locations for 1.6 million homes are identified in current regional plans, with up to a further 200,000 emerging in the new regional spatial strategies and future revisions to them. This includes 650,000 homes in the growth areas such as the Thames Gateway and Milton Keynes. &#147;Forty-five towns and cities have already come forward with proposals for additional homes over the next 10 years in new growth points. We are today inviting more councils to come forward to be new growth points, including in the north of England. We are also inviting bids for councils and developers to come forward with proposals for at least five new eco towns. No one should be in any doubt about the historic scale of this vision; we are proposing the first new towns in 40 years. &#147;Further changes are needed to support the delivery of these homes. Providing enough land is vital and councils need to identify 15 years&#146; supply of appropriate land for housing, with the continuing priority for sustainable brownfield land. We will not change the rules on strong green-belt protection. We will introduce additional funding and incentives for councils and communities that are showing a lead in delivering growth&#151;through a new housing and planning delivery grant, a new

We will work across Government to bring forward more brownfield land. I can announce that the MoD has agreed to bring forward six sites with the potential for 7,000 homes, including at Aldershot and Chichester. The Department for Transport has also identified hundreds of potential sites.&#147;We will support local councils in setting up new local housing companies with partners to use their own land to build more homes. I can announce that 14 councils have already come forward. They estimate that in their areas alone they have the potential to deliver 35,000 homes on their land, with 17,500 of them affordable homes. Better use also needs to be made of empty homes, including those left empty long-term by investors and speculators. Councils already have powers to take action and we will look at the potential for additional incentives for them to do so.&#147;Secondly, building more homes is crucial, but they must be better and more sustainable homes. In the 1960s, quality was sacrificed in the name of speed. We must not make those mistakes again. Today, our new homes must be part of well designed and mixed communities with excellent local facilities. This means more family homes as well as parks and green spaces, and with the urgent challenge of climate change they must be greener homes, built to the highest environmental standards. I can confirm that from 2016, all new homes will need to be zero-carbon. We are the first country to set such an ambitious timetable, and I welcome the support of councils, green groups and developers across the country that are committed to working with us to make this happen.&#147;As well as helping to prevent climate change, we need to ensure that our homes are resilient to its consequences. Over the centuries, many homes have been built in high-risk flood areas, and my right honourable friend has set out immediate action to support the families suffering dreadfully from the extreme weather. Since 1997, we have progressively strengthened the rules on planning to protect homes from flooding, with much higher standards brought in last year. These new rules require councils to consult the Environment Agency. Where the agency says that the risk is too high and councils persist against that advice, we in the Government will be prepared to take over those decisions ourselves. We will also look further at what needs to be done to be ready for future challenges. Later this year we will publish a new planning policy statement that will require local councils to plan more widely for the consequences of climate change.&#147;Thirdly, we believe that a decent home should be for the many, not the few. I can announce that we will invest &#163;8 billion on increasing affordable housing over the next three years, an increase of &#163;3 billion  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_588"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 588</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when compared with the previous spending review. This is on top of continuing investment in decent homes, including over &#163;2 billion on the ALMO programme over the next three years. We have listened to the evidence from Shelter and the National Housing Federation. They have said that we need 70,000 affordable homes a year, of which 50,000 should be new social housing. I can announce that by 2010-11, we will deliver over 70,000 new affordable homes a year. By 2011 we will deliver 45,000 new social homes a year, with a goal of 50,000 in the next spending review. We will also deliver 25,000 new shared ownership homes through expanding existing programmes. Further, we will look to support tens of thousands of additional shared ownership homes through public sector land and local housing companies. As rural areas face particular pressures, we will set a specific target for increasing affordable homes in rural areas later this year after consultation with the regional assemblies.&#147;We want to see more work by local councils, housing associations and the private sector to increase affordable housing, both to buy and to rent. We are announcing today the first 10 ALMOs and local authority special venture vehicles approved to bid for social housing grant in order to build council homes. We are also consulting on changes to the rules on the treatment of rents and receipts from new homes which will give councils more flexibility to build on their land within responsible public finance rules.&#147;We believe that first-time buyers need more flexible and competitive products today. The Treasury is consulting on new ways to support more affordable long-term fixed-rate mortgages. We have also commissioned further work, led by Bryan Pomeroy, on expanding private sector shared equity products, and will launch new shared equity products next year. In the mean time, we will offer a new 17.5 per cent government equity loan for key workers and other priority first-time buyers.&#147;Taken together, these proposals represent not just the most significant programme of house building for decades, but an ambitious and positive response to the growing challenges that many people face in their day-to-day lives. To deliver it, we will need an expanded, skilled workforce. The new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills will lead work to expand construction apprenticeships and work with partners in the sector to raise skills. We know that there is no quick fix for the issues we face. Building more houses takes time, so this must be a shared endeavour. Central government are today setting a bolder framework for the future, but we will achieve our goals only if those at regional and local levels in the public, private and third sectors and in local communities all play their part in supporting the homes we need.&#147;Building the sustainable homes needed by young people today and future generations is a test of our commitment to supporting people&#146;s aspirations and to achieving social justice. I commend these proposals to the House&#148;.

I add my sympathy to all the home owners and owners of commercial premises who are caught up in the present disastrous flooding situation, and, indeed, to those who may yet be caught.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="0707232000288"></a>I declare an interest in that I own land in Essex. It is always possible that some of that land may become eligible for development and it is right that the House should know that.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="0707232000289"></a>The background to the Statement is perhaps not quite as rosy as the Minister stated because the Government have seen annual construction fall to a level below that in the 1920s. There has, of course, been some improvement since then, which is a great relief, but the annual housing construction rate is only a little over 50 per cent of what it was when I first entered local government. We cannot be easy about the present situation and, in the circumstances, I did not find it odd that the Prime Minister, in his programme statement last week, focused on housing and planning.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="0707232000290"></a>Among other things, he referred to brownfield sites. I recall that that was included in an early policy statement by the Labour Government after the 1997 election. The former Deputy Prime Minister made much of what was going to be done&#151;and I acknowledge that it has been very successful with brownfield sites&#151;but there is nothing particularly new about that. There is going to be a review of government and publicly owned properties and the same comments apply; these were early adoptions of policy by the Labour Government. They have shown success but restating that does not take us forward.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="0707232000291"></a>The Prime Minister referred to some 550 central government-owned sites with a capacity for 100,000 new homes and local government-owned sites for another 60,000 homes. The Statement refers, quite rightly, to the existing 1.8 million sites that are already planned and that the Government would like to have supplied 3 million new homes by 2020. If my arithmetic is somewhere near correct, that merely leaves us with 1,040,000 sites to find over the next decade and a half.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="0707232000292"></a>I accept that this is the inevitable result of the planning system which, at the moment, is operating to rather too short a timescale, but the real question is: what steps are the Government taking to discuss and get the agreement of local authorities to these new figures, which I am prepared to accept are valid? There has been no resolution of the difference between local government and central government on this matter so far. In my view, the Government&#146;s handling of the issue has been somewhat inept but, without a degree of consensus, there is not much hope of achieving the Government&#146;s target.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="0707232000293"></a>The Government&#146;s social housing programme is also welcome. Extra funding for 30,000 plus houses will be extremely useful and I acknowledge that it will do a great deal to expand construction in this field. However, social housing, by definition, needs to be where it is wanted; it needs to be in town centres and  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_590"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 590</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so on. Looking at sites such as old hospital park sites in green belts, brownfield sites such as redundant airfields, or the Government&#146;s suggested publicly owned sites, will not help on the social housing front. Social housing needs to have easy access to the work places of the people who occupy them. Again, the question is: what work is being done to arrive at agreement with local government on this issue?</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="0707232000294"></a>Finally, I turn to the difficult issue of building on flood-plains. I accept that it has a long historical background. Towns were inevitably built next to river crossings because that was where people gathered, and they have grown from that. There has always been a risk of flooding. Things can be done to ameliorate that but in the end, if the good Lord treats us in a hard way, there will be floods.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="0707232000295"></a>What is being done to deal with additional flood protection? Much more could be done using artificial flood plains and better construction techniques. More could be done to protect the essential services in particular, such as electricity, gas, water and food, so that their sites were not affected by floods and those services would continue to be available. Part of the difficulty with the present situation is the breakdown of services because of the inability to protect those aspects of supply.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="0707232000296"></a>That is quite enough from me. I hope the Minister will be able to answer these points, because it is an essential facet of resolving this problem that there has to be a high degree of agreement.</p>
<a name="time_18"></a>

I join with others in sympathising with all those who are suffering the terrible flooding in many parts of the country. I declare an interest as a member of Berwick Borough Council, which is a housing authority.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="0707232000299"></a>The Statement seemed to gloss over the past 10 years. The housing situation has not suddenly come upon us, nor has it crept up on us; it has been obvious to quite a few of us during that time. It started when the present Prime Minister became Chancellor and, for the first two years, stuck to the Conservative spending plans on housing. Indeed, as time went on, the amount he spent became less than the money spent by the Conservatives in the last years of the John Major Government. I found that extraordinary, because the huge increases in house prices meant that the Chancellor was getting hefty sums of money in stamp duty that he had had no idea he would get. He missed a trick there, but I have said that many times before in this House.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="0707232000300"></a>For most of those 10 years, it has been obvious to most people that household formation was outstripping housing supply at quite a rate. The Statement says that house building is at its highest for 17 years. That may be so, but we know that most of the houses are not affordable to anyone any more, and they are certainly not the right type of houses in the right places. We applaud efforts to build more affordable homes, but what steps will the Government take to keep them affordable? I commend to the Minister a system in  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_591"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>south Shropshire, which Liberal Democrat councillors came up with and which I suspect civil servants know about, called &#147;golden shares&#148;, to ensure that houses are kept affordable for local people in the future. I suggest that where homes are built on surplus public sector land&#151;I think that about 550 sites are currently owned by the Government&#151;community land trusts are set up. That means that when the houses are sold on for the first time, they remain affordable. I would like the Minister to reply to that, because it is important. Otherwise we will end up in exactly this position, with houses not being affordable.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="0707232000301"></a>The Statement also highlighted the role of empty properties. Again, many of us have been working on that issue for years, and we had to drag the Government kicking and screaming to change the council tax regime on empty properties. Then what did they do? They gave the money to the county councils, which are not housing authorities. In our authority we do not get it all back to spend on local housing. Another issue that I have raised many times is VAT on repairs. Many empty properties need repairs and refurbishment, and whereas there is no VAT on new build, there is 17.5 per cent tax on repairs.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="0707232000302"></a>I welcome the Government&#146;s recognition at last that local authorities best understand the housing needs in their area. But I am a bit confused about the accountability for the spatial strategy. When, some years ago, we dealt in this House with the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill that gave the regional assemblies the power to deal with the spatial strategies, I did not expect the regional assemblies to disappear, which I now understand will happen by 2010. However, the Government will now consult them on the new spatial strategies.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="0707232000303"></a>I hope that the Government are clearer in their mind than I am, given all the things that have happened. One of the references to rural areas is to consult the regional assemblies. In my part of the country, north Northumberland, we are allowed to build about 80 houses a year. We need more than that to keep our communities sustainable, yet the power to influence the spatial strategy has been virtually nil. I hope that the Government will take note of this. In some areas, 50 per cent of houses are second homes. I do not know what the Government are planning to do about that&#151;there was nothing about it in the Statement. Everybody recognises that where 50 per cent of homes are second homes, a lot of facilities, such as post offices and schools, disappear.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="0707232000304"></a>Over the past 10 years, social housing has been a Cinderella area, not in terms of refurbishment but of new build. I welcome the fact that the Government are trying to do something about it. Again, this situation has not crept up on us&#151;we have lost lots of social housing because of the right to buy and the inability of local authorities to replace those houses. The Government again came late to that.</p>

<a name="70723-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="0707232000305"></a>On green homes, Scandinavia and northern Europe have for years been building far more environmentally friendly houses than we have. I welcome the Government&#146;s conversion but, by golly, it has taken a long time. But there is no mention in the Statement of the existing homes, many of which are very energy-inefficient. I

In another place, my Private Member&#146;s Bill tried to do more about it&#151;but that was 12 years ago and we still need to do something. Again, the VAT is important in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="0707232000306"></a>Will the Minister really look at some of the things that the Government are setting up? I have just returned to local government after about 14 years, and what strikes me is the bureaucratic systems that the Government are setting up. I notice at least four more in this Statement&#151;the community infrastructure fund, the housing and planning delivery grant, new local housing companies and authority special venture vehicles. The Government are consulting on the rules on the treatment of rents and receipts from new homes. I can remember the days when local authorities had a lot more freedom; they knew what the people in their areas wanted and they built some very good homes. I hope that the Government will listen to local authorities&#151;please, please do not make the situation more bureaucratic than it already is.</p>

Nevertheless, I think that there is a consensus across the House of how important it is to meet the needs of young people who are falling off the property ladder or not even being able to get on it, and to address the very serious problem of housing.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07072319000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, criticised the fact that we may have glossed over the history of this problem. It is not recent; over the past 30 years, there has been a 30 per cent increase in household formation and a 50 per cent drop in housebuilding. The problem is not 10 years old; it goes back much further. But in the past 10 years patterns of family change and formation have been accelerated and different. The major pressure is coming from single people choosing to live alone, and many of those are now part of our ageing population, so we have new pressures and patterns in the system to which we must respond.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07072319000004"></a>There has been a significant increase in housebuilding in the past year, with a net addition of 185,000 homes. It is therefore important that we look seriously at the history, but also acknowledge the significance and scope of what we are trying to do. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, for listing some of our efforts on brownfield sites and in bringing forward public land. Not only do we have a good record on brownfield development, but surplus land now goes much further. We are looking for new approaches to toughen up the register of surplus land, which will have to be much more reflective of housing policy. In planning policy statement 3, we made clear to local authorities the need to bring forward land for five and 15 years&#146; supply, so that they can predict and plan much more robustly. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, described the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit and some other organisations as bureaucratic, but they are about delivery. The  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_593"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 593</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Community Infrastructure Fund has delivered just over &#163;1 billion to the new growth areas in this country for infrastructure. We have these vehicles for a purpose. I can assure noble Lords that we are not in the business of inventing new bureaucracies.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07072319000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, asked what steps we are taking to ensure a reconciliation of ambitions between local authorities and national government. That is an important question. The final part of my Statement was about the need for a partnership between everybody who is concerned about housing supply. It is entirely proper that the Government should set ambitious targets for housing, because it is their responsibility to enable people to live in a decent home. That is where the buck stops. The process of deciding with local authorities and regional organisations where, and what sort of, houses should be built is tested in public and by examination, and negotiated through the regional spatial strategies. It is a robust process over which local authorities have great influence.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07072319000006"></a>We said in the announcement on the sub-national review last week that planning would move to the regional development agencies&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, made a point on this&#151;because we need a regional economic strategy that brings everything together, including housing, planning and skills. That has implications for the regional assemblies, but it has implications also for local authorities being able to play a much more robust role in the beginning. That is what the Local Government Association wanted.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07072319000007"></a>On social housing, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that, wherever we build, we have to have a proportion of affordable housing. No developer is going to get away with not building affordable housing. Social housing is as much needed in rural areas as it is in inner cities.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07072319000008"></a>We take the risk of flooding very seriously, as the previous Statement made clear. We must prevent it. Our new flooding statement, PPS 25 of last December, pointed to the need to ensure that flood risk from all sources&#151;not just from rivers but also, particularly in today&#146;s instances, from surface water&#151;is taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Inappropriate development must be avoided; development must be directed away from high-risk areas. We have announced a review of the lessons learnt from the 2007 floods and will see whether there are implications from its findings. Yes, we need to make space for water as well as to deal with floods, just as the noble Lord described. Our building in the Thames Gateway and other growth areas is tested against that.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07072319000009"></a>I was pleased that the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, drew innovative schemes to our attention. Throughout what we have said about local authorities&#146; capacity to build more in different ways with different partners, we are looking for and at innovation.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07072319000010"></a>I was asked about equity sharing. We aim to help 120,000 people through equity-sharing arrangements by 2010. In addition, we have come forward with a new product, which involves a government equity loan of 17.5 per cent, which will make matters even easier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07072319000011"></a>I have spoken about the accountability of the spatial strategy. I was asked about green homes. Our ambition for new homes is simply for them to be carbon free by 2016. The homes in which we live now can be hugely improved, which is why we have brought forward energy performance certificates and why we are advocating better ways of conserving water in different systems. In addition, schemes such as Warm Front will help people not only to reduce their bills but also to be safer and warmer through the winter.</p>

Now that the GLA Bill is nearly through, will my noble friend reconsider my proposal in Committee on the GLA Bill, which was based on detailed research of this abuse in London, for footage percentage, and not unit percentage, calculations to be used in affordable housing decisions in London, because we are simply not getting the number of units that we need?</p>

Has the Minister had the opportunity of reading an important article by Sir Simon Jenkins in the <I>Sunday Times</I> of 15 July and, if so, does she agree with any of the substantive points that he made? Given that the Government have an obligation to try to ensure that the people of this country are decently housed, does she recognise that this really should mean increasing the supply of rented housing, where the occupant rather than the house is subsidised? Does she recognise that there can be no obligation, if only because it is unachievable, to ensure that everyone who wants to own their home can do so regardless of their means, because to offer to do so will lead only to disappointment? Lastly, has the MoD included RAF Northolt in its six sites on offer for brownfield development?</p>

On reading it quickly, I do not think that there is much in it with which I agree, but, if the noble Lord will allow, I will come back to him with a proper response. The article states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="07072319000134"></a>&#147;The reality is that Britons squander their limited living space more than any country in Europe&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07072319000123"></a>I do not agree with that, having seen how other countries in Europe build with enormous profligacy across enormous spaces. I am sure that I will find other things to disagree with as I read on. If we do not do anything more than we are doing at the moment in this country, by 2016&#151;it may be 2026, but I will have to check&#151;the ratio of house prices to earnings will be 10 to one. We cannot afford not to do anything about it. The noble Lord&#146;s point about the importance of rented housing was absolutely correct. We need all sorts of different forms of housing. We must look seriously at that sector as well. I cannot give an answer to his question about RAF Northolt. I shall write to him and give him an idea of the identified sites of which we are aware.</p>

Why is it therefore necessary to create local authority special venture vehicles to do so, rather than allow local authorities to build local authority homes? Secondly, will the Minister say something about the infrastructure that will be required to enable the development of large sites such as those belonging to the Ministry of Defence? I do not mean just transport; I mean everything that is required to make a community function, including schools, health centres and so on. Thirdly&#151;and this is also an infrastructure point&#151;noble Lords have mentioned flooding and building on flood plains. Does the Minister accept that the intensification in town centres will have an impact on drainage and sewerage and that everywhere with a Victorian sewerage system must therefore be high risk?</p>

Other people build and develop better, not least the housing associations, which can borrow money on the open market. That is why, for example, we have been able to raise &#163;19 billion for the decent homes strategy, which uses the local authorities.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07072319000019"></a>The special venture vehicles, along with the new local housing partnerships, are new ways in which to raise capacity and increase the role of local authorities in innovative ways. Some local authorities have been very open with us about the lack of capacity. This is what will make sense with regard to deliverability.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07072319000020"></a>As for infrastructure, the noble Baroness is absolutely right. The sort of infrastructure necessary to be planned into the new growth areas is why, for example, more than &#163;1 billion in growth area funds and &#163;200 million from the Community Infrastructure Fund have been awarded so far. Those sorts of infrastructure are accompanied by massive investment in education, schools, new health centres, transport and so on. This is very much a coherent programme and we are very well aware of the implications. The Treasury cross-cutting review on infrastructure is looking at how to pull all this together.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07072319000021"></a>Building communities is about more than building physical infrastructure. It is about community building: building memory in and building activity for young people, with safe green spaces, and creating spacious

That is what people want. Throughout this Green Paper and planning policy statement 3, we make it absolutely clear that we are not in the business of building homes or estates. We are building communities, which need lungs and space to thrive. That is important, as is the question of quality, which runs through this Green Paper.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07072319000022"></a>The noble Baroness asked about flood plains and town centres. There is an issue here about intensification of use, but it is not confined to town centres. One reason why the water companies are addressing the issue of repair to such an extent is the real need in that regard. Drainage and sewerage systems are as important as, if not more important than, providing fresh water supplies.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07072319000023"></a>On the figure that I gave about the income ratios, the ratio between prices and earnings will be 10 to one by 2026.</p>

We should be generous in extending our welcome to an additional &#163;3 billion investment in the next spending period on social housing, and &#163;8 billion in the period to 2016.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07072319000025"></a>I draw attention to two aspects of the Statement that are extremely welcome. We are unusual but not unique in this country in not having a single mechanism for wholesaling public sector assets and land. Many other countries do that before they decide whether public assets are surplus. The Statement moves us a long way forward in giving the Register of Surplus Public Sector Land some teeth. It is excellent news that we are putting an end to the practice of selling public sector land and assets with no regard to housing policy. That is extremely welcome.</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07072319000026"></a>I also welcome the return of local councils sponsoring developments in their local areas. Will my noble friend reassure us that we are talking about not a return to wholesale mono-tenure council housing of the type that we saw in the 1950s and 1960s but rather a return to local authorities sponsoring mixed developments in their areas, with a whole range of tenures and houses for sale in communities?</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07072319000027"></a>We should remember that over the past 40 to 50 years, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, rightly pointed out, there was a decrease in construction. But over that long-running trend the private housebuilders have held up the numbers; the withdrawal from publicly sponsored housing almost entirely accounts for that decrease in housing numbers. So it is very welcome that after 20 years the Government have decided to do this. I thank my noble friend again for the Statement.</p>

I take the opportunity to thank her on behalf not only of the Government but of everyone who wants a decent home for the sort of work that English Partnerships has done for the near and long-term future in bringing land forward and being so proactive and supportive of these ambitions. She is right in saying that we have not had a very toothy register so far, but we will have one now and it will make a big difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07072319000029"></a>I can certainly give her the reassurance that we are not in the business of building housing estates. One thing that the Green Paper makes clear is that we very much want local authorities to build mixed developments. We do not want ghettos or just flats being built; we want family homes, large family homes and mixed developments, so that people of all incomes and tenures can coexist harmoniously together. That is very much a clear steer for future building. Some of the new settlements&#151;in the eco-towns, for example&#151;will be extremely broad in terms of their tenure arrangements.</p>

Can she confirm, too, that British citizens resident overseas who sell their property before returning do not have to pay capital gains tax?

Today we are completing some 40 per cent fewer houses a year than we were in the 1970s. To give an example of why targets are not the problem, in my own local authority area in Kent we have a nine-year land bank available now of housing land allocated in local plans, but it is not being built on simply because of the lack of transport infrastructure. Eighteen months ago, the IPPR report said that transport infrastructure today was less than it was in the early 1990s. Furthermore, does the Minister agree that the much more devolved system enjoyed by European countries in relation to transport infrastructure, economic development and housing powers has been shown to deliver more houses and to keep supply in much better balance with demand?</p>

Building in transport infrastructure, when one is trying to get release of land, is nearly always very complicated. You can see that across the growth areas. However, the highways agencies are working very successfully and more effectively now than they have been. The noble Lord will know that we have looked at different ways in which to strengthen these sorts of arrangements through the sub-national review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07072319000034"></a>I must correct something that I said earlier. The figure of &#163;1 billion that I gave for communities infrastructure is the amount for our own funding from CLG from 2003 to 2008.

She ought not to be put off by the critics who say, with hindsight, what has not been achieved. In my view, the Government are wise to acknowledge that much more could be done, but, at the same time, the House should recognise that a great deal has been done and that what has been said promises even more, especially on affordable housing. Will the Minister look at that situation?</p>

<a name="70723-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07072319000036"></a>When the right-to-buy policy came in in 1979, it was very popular, not least because those who already had the largesse of a tenancy from a local authority had the additional bonus, if they sold the property¸ of receiving large cash sums. In Edmonton, where I was Member of Parliament, we found over the years that properties that were bought for &#163;7,000 or &#163;8,000 were changing hands for over &#163;100,000 in a very short space of time. The greatest boon that the Government can give, through agencies and directly, is tenancies to those who are desperate for a house. That ought not to include a hidden bonus that, at some time in the future, they will be able to sell it and get hundreds of thousands of pounds. Is the Minister aware of that aggravation and can she say something about readjustments to the present policy? It was a bribe then and it is a bribe now.</p>

For very good reasons, we remain committed to home ownership as an aspiration. We have supported the principle of the right to buy, although, over the years, we have changed the conditions. We do not have any plans for changing the terms of the right-to-buy policy, but I know that he will be very pleased by our commitment to new affordable housing: at least 70,000 by 2010; 45,000 new homes each year, or 50 per cent more than this year; and &#163;8 billion over three years. It is a very significant investment, which will help the kind of people about whom he has always been concerned throughout his long political career.</p>

Does she agree that in the dash for housing it is important not to neglect quality and to remember the importance of the human scale of development? From what she has said, I am sure that she does agree with that, but I invite her to recognise that, if we are to live up to the aspirations of which she has spoken in the Green Paper, a change of policy will be required in certain areas. I am certainly aware of proposed developments in the area of London in which I live where those principles will not be adhered to unless we see a change of heart among those who sponsor them.</p>

We shall certainly expand our partnership with CABE, which we have had over many years, and which has been invaluable in terms of articulating what we think of as good design and quality. I am sure that that will be very successful. The noble Lord is absolutely right about small open spaces. In recent years, one achievement has been the renaissance of our parks. In building new communities, whether in airfield sites or eco-towns, we will have a wonderful opportunity to pioneer new ways of living and new types of community living. I hope that in due course Scandinavians may come here, rather than us going to Scandinavia, to see what can be achieved on sustainability and beauty.</p>

One thing that makes people like me suspicious about what is to emerge from the Bill is the phraseology of Clause 222(2). To put it at its simplest, the activities that are described in the subsection are all about process; they are not about outcomes. That pertinent point was raised earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger. It is as if all that matters is that someone observes the carrying on of health and social care commissioning and provision and obtains people&#146;s views. What is the point of that activity? The point is to improve the quality of local services. Why do we not say that that is what LINks are there to do? Equally, why do we not say, in terms, that it is not enough for the contract with the host to specify that the activities mentioned are carried on; the contract needs to have as its aim that those activities should be undertaken effectively.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07072319000044"></a>There is a very sterile and neutral feel about the wording in this part of the clause. Surprisingly, there is not even any mention of one of the main aims of patient and public involvement, which is to try to promote the interests of those people in the community whose voice is less often heard, or who, for one reason or another, are the victims of health inequalities. A good LINk will tackle social exclusion head-on and try to remedy it.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07072319000045"></a>Perhaps I can illustrate that idea briefly. The Minister will be well aware that life expectancy varies depending on the area of the country where one lives, Manchester being the worst area for both men and women. If those with the shortest life expectancy do not have

A good example might be stop-smoking services, which need to be offered at the times of day and in the locations when those of working age in manual groups, which have higher rates of smoking, may access them easily. If they are involved in the design of services, those kinds of issues could be raised. Similarly, smoking in pregnancy is more than four times higher in social class 5 than in social class 1. The involvement of women from deprived areas in designing antenatal services could improve the success of those services. We know that the rate of perinatal mortality is twice as high among mothers living in the most deprived areas. It is essential for these groups to be involved in services so that they are designed effectively. There are any number of other examples, not least&#151;it is fresh in my mind&#151;the need to involve black and ethnic-minority patients in the design of psychiatric services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07072319000046"></a>I hope the Minister will accept that that is a real issue. If LINks are able to make reports and recommendations to those with the appropriate power to change things in the health service or social care, then there should not be an artificial restriction on to whom they can report. The wording does not make it entirely clear and I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that the persons responsible for commissioning, providing, managing or scrutinising local care services could include, for example, the Healthcare Commission and CSCI.</p>

<p><a name="07072319000124"></a>That might seem perfectly all right until we remember that not everything that a patients&#146; forum is currently able to report on relates to health services as commonly understood. For example, concerns may be expressed about car-parking charges, waiting areas for hospital visitors or transport arrangements. These are matters that contribute to the patient experience in the broad sense but they are not directly to do with care. Can the Minister confirm that such matters will not be excluded from the purview of LINks? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07072319000049"></a>The clause states that it is to enable &#147;people&#148; to monitor the local health activities. Instead, we have inserted,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000141"></a>&#147;members of the local involvement network&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000125"></a>If we are moving to LINks, and it seems fairly clear that&#151;with all the queries that we have&#151;we are, then it is right that we should say so and say what we mean about membership of those LINks. I am enormously grateful to the involvement network, which is a network of hosts, for the information it has submitted. It suggested that we must move to a system where LINks are sufficiently flexible,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000142"></a>&#147;to allow members to respond at least as quickly and effectively, in the interests of those seeking or receiving service, as the Forums can do now&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="07072319000143"></a>About forums, it said that they,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000144"></a>&#147;generally have developed small, trained and experienced teams made up of members&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000145"></a>and other participants,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000146"></a>&#147;who are able to respond and take action faster and with a different perspective than other scrutiny or regulatory bodies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000126"></a>It added that,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000147"></a>&#147;they are often more effective at eliciting a response because they are more down-to-earth, can work more simply and directly, including with staff at all levels&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000127"></a>and they,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000148"></a>&#147;remain focused on what matters to patients and their families&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000128"></a>That is exactly what we want LINks to be. The involvement network has suggested that we need to create &#147;classes of membership&#148; for LINks, and that might mean having a variety of memberships for groups and for individuals and at many different levels. Whatever it is, we need people to be members of that entity. The incredibly loose network that the Minister described before the Statement seems to be too loose to be bearable.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07072319000050"></a>However the model works, there must be some sense in which LINks have members. Anna Coote, a former colleague at the King&#146;s Fund who was on the group that looked at the new structure and who is now at the Healthcare Commission, suggested in her evidence to the Health Select Committee that the original idea was a &#147;true network&#148;&#151;something very loose indeed&#151;but that it was shifting somewhat. The Health Select Committee argued that the Department of Health was reluctant to talk about membership of a LINk, but we argue that if LINks are to do anything and gather views properly they will need members and some clarity of what kind of entity they are. It is essential, however loose they are or how many classes of membership there may be, that they know who their members are and who they can charge with taking on various functions, duties, activities or whatever it is they will be called.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07072319000052"></a>Before that, I should explain to my noble friend why I have added my name to a number of the amendments being debated today. My noble friend will remember that I was critical of the Government&#146;s decision to abolish community health councils in 2002, feeling that they should be strengthened and reformed instead. Their successor, the patients&#146; forums&#151;I prefer to say fora&#151;are now to be abolished in turn instead of being strengthened, perhaps with their structure and functions revised in light of experience and developments in the National Health Service and other social institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07072319000053"></a>Just over a week ago, my noble friend Lord Layard wrote an article in the <I>Guardian</I> entitled, &#147;No change for change&#146;s sake&#148;. I will quote a small part:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="07072319000136"></a>&#147;Reorganisation is much less important than some think. In fact, many different organisational structures can be made to work equally well. What cannot work is constant reorganisation, where nobody understands what is happening, institutional memory is lost, and everybody worries about their future rather than the job in hand&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000129"></a>Exactly. However, the Government have gone so far down the road to establish LINks, instead of patient participation for a, that our job today is to probe the

In fact, the concept of LINks is admirable in many ways, particularly in that it covers the area of local authorities, rather than individual trusts. It also includes primary care and&#151;better than anything&#151;social services in its remit. It is potentially an extremely valuable reorganisation, although its remit could have been included in those of existing bodies. The Government have said that, by leaving some of the wording of the Bill non-specific, they will allow for flexibility in operation, but we feel that inserting certain words will make it easier for those setting up and working in LINks to carry out their tasks and to know what those tasks are.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07072319000054"></a>The main purpose of the amendments, as noble Lords have said, is exploratory. It is appropriate for me, as a government Back-Bencher, to join the cross-party group that has tabled these amendments given that many Labour Party members and supporters&#151;not least on the Health Select Committee of another place&#151;are very concerned and have misgivings about the Bill.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07072319000055"></a>I want to talk a bit about Amendment No. 238KL. Its purpose is to expand how LINks are to obtain the views of the population in their areas. Clause 222, at page 154, line 36, talks about local authorities,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000149"></a>&#147;obtaining the views of people&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000130"></a>That is extremely non-specific. That means that they can just go into the street and ask the views of a selection of passers-by. The amendment inserts, instead of &#147;obtaining&#148;,</p>

I was somewhat disappointed when the Minister gave us the impression that some of us, by probing these issues, might not be in favour of change. I think that change is often extremely positive but, to take change forward, we have to understand how we harness the energy of those involved in existing services and do not demoralise them. The management of change is around gathering people with you and taking you forward with their energy. If we are to take these changes forward, we have to conceptualise what this is about&#151;and I am struggling to do that, particularly when I read in Clause 222 that the activities include,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07072319000059"></a>The commissioning of local care services is a highly complex process. What kind of organisation will we have? I continue to use that phrase, &#147;What kind of organisation?&#148;, because I do not know the terminology with which to describe the matrix it appears that the LINks will be. I agree with these amendments&#151;we have to have some sort of form and structure, some sort of membership and some sort of understanding of the host. I agree with my noble friend who asked who the hosts will be. I do not understand that and have very little idea of what their governance relationship is with the local authority or the primary healthcare trust&#151;or, indeed, how those two relate to the LINks in terms of governance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07072319000060"></a>I am sorry if this is losing some thread in our discussion and the nature of the documents that have been sent out. I have tried to follow it, but, as the noble Baroness will know, I spend a lot of my time in governance and trying to sort out some of the difficulties of change that the Government have created, which have not been too easy. I ask these probing questions simply because I am keen that we do not again create an animal that is unmanageable and something that we will have to unpick. This is a crucial change for the future.</p>

Those will be very important points to explore later and I very much agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Rea, said, because he put some of our concerns very effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07072319000063"></a>Perhaps I may use an example from my local authority in Kent. Three years ago it wanted to support the patient forums by establishing an independent focal point to allow patients and residents to report their experiences of the NHS. We have, like many local authorities, a 200-seat, 24-hour-a-day call centre. We were simply suggesting that people could phone in, because one of the problems of patient forums is&#151;and one of the problems of LINks will be&#151;the large amount of anecdotal evidence. What they need is a professional organisation to take widespread opinion, to analyse that and produce hard evidence of patient experiences. This seemed a good idea. We called it Kent Health Watch, but at the time it was opposed by the NHS health authority. However, such an idea would be immensely valuable. Amendment No. 238KG and the clause bring that out. Will the Minister support the establishment of that kind of patient information base, which is very important both for information and choice?</p>

I much admire the noble Earl&#146;s struggle with language. Sometimes we seem to exist in a virtual universe when we consider the language of parliamentary draftsmen. That is not unique to this Bill, but it is, perhaps, perplexing here. The noble Earl also did the House a service by emphasising how important it was for the LINks networks to be as wide as possible. The examples he gave, not least regarding the relationships of black and ethnic minorities with mental health services, were absolutely right. All I would say is that that is precisely why we have not listed organisations in the Bill or defined the scope and extent of a LINk, simply because we have made it clear in everything that we have written and sent out that the test of a LINk will be how far it reaches into the community.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07072319000065"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that I certainly did not mean to denigrate people who manage change and who have had successfully to manage a great deal of change in recent years. I understand why she pushed me on clarity and I will do my best to conceptualise this and to answer some of the question that arise.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07072319000066"></a>Amendment No. 238KC seeks to insert &#147;effectively&#148; in relation to the means by which LINks arrangements can be delivered. What we mean by &#147;effective&#148; is, essentially, that LINks will be organisations with sufficient scope, as I have said, to bring in the widest and most effective range of influences for different purposes. Those influences may be very specific to an interest group made up, for example, of people clustered around the independent living agenda. The influences may be broad in relation to changes proposed whereby this alliance, this network, will have a collective view of the impact it will have or some of the changes that it wants to see. Some of those changes may run across interests and conditions but will affect a particular age group, such as the elderly or the young. So there will be, I am afraid, infinite variety. It is that sort of inference.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07072319000067"></a>The test of effectiveness is that there will be governance arrangements which are clear about the relative role of the host. The LINk will take decisions on priorities and activities and the host will provide the necessary support for them to carry it out. In all the documentation we have put out, that distinction and the need to be clear about that is vital. There will be clear and responsible partnerships with stakeholders, such as overview and scrutiny committees. Local partnerships will establish the role in relation to commissioning, at what point the LINk organisation and in what form&#151;a group, a small sub-committee&#151;would have a role in looking at the commissioning of particular services, maybe specialist services. Those sorts of things can be determined as the structure evolves.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07072319000068"></a>There are clear accountabilities in the system. Local authorities have a duty to make arrangements to establish a LINk. The host will be accountable for the delivery of the contract and provide appropriate support, advice and infrastructure. The LINk is accountable to the community. It will reflect the range of organisations and interest groups which have an interest in the whole range of services and working with them to obtain the

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07072319000069"></a>We sought at the outset to establish a means of informing ourselves and local authorities on what will work best, and that was the point of the earlier adopter schemes. They are not pilots; they are earlier adopter schemes, attempting to show how different models of activity may work, how people can be engaged in different ways, how LINks can be governed, and, in short how they can be as effective as possible. We have just completed nine regional events at which we asked all stakeholders interested in LINks for their views on how the arrangements should be set up. The responses indicate that people were really keen for options to be set out in guidance on how best to deliver LINks&#146; functions and structures, how best to engage, how to reach the seldom-heard groups, how to make model policies on areas such as codes of conduct. No one has asked for that to be put in legislation. They have asked for help and guidance on how to formulate it. It seems to me that that is the responsibility of Government.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07072319000070"></a>We have consulted many voluntary and community organisations and there is a huge range of experience among them for obtaining responses and voices. The model contract specification was drawn up with their input to make sure that it set out the key features, which may well have been things that LINks are not as well as things that LINks should be.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07072319000071"></a>On contracting, local authorities are very accustomed to contracting local service providers and performance-managing those contracts. We explored the great variety of innovative arrangements at an early stage of this Bill. Local authorities are increasingly confident about new types of arrangements. By giving them a clear duty to make the arrangements necessary to establish the support LINks, we have chosen the right organisation to fulfil the role.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07072319000072"></a>I return to the notion of effectiveness. No, I will not return to the notion of effectiveness; I shall go on with the logic of what I was saying.</p>

<a name="70723-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07072319000073"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 238KG, KE and KG. They seek to articulate the notion of members of LINks. My noble friend asked how one obtains the views of people and I would say to him that there is a huge range of options. I take the point he is making. I am not sure that I agree with him but I listened hard to what he said. The point is that there is an enormous range of experience on how to obtain voices, not just through existing organisations, which are often membership-based and therefore have responsibility to reflect their members&#146; views, but also through the new range of technologies which make it very easy indeed&#151;not least e-gov with its direct relationship with local government&#151;for people to text or e-mail what they feel about things. So we have ways of doing this which we did not have before. The example given by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, in relation to this was very interesting and I would like to think about what he said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07072319000074"></a>This batch of amendments is generally about giving identity to LINKs; giving members individual or collective identity or responsibility. I come back to where I

Obviously there will be participants in LINks who want to take on a more active role than others, who want to form the steering committee, and they will be enabled to come forward. The host&#146;s first task is to identify who in the local area is active, involved and committed and who among those committed organisations, as they come forward, might be willing to take on some of these responsibilities. It will be an open but negotiated process. We have not prescribed whether there should be a board or a steering committee but it is very unlikely that there would not be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07072319000075"></a>In terms of membership, the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, asked why certain people could not be members. The involvement network has come up with some interesting ideas but it would be difficult to put classes of membership in the Bill. A company limited by guarantee or a charity could be members. There is nothing to stop it being a membership organisation but this should be for local people to decide. I know it is not easy. We are wrestling with a bit of a miasma but that is in the nature of what we are trying to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07072319000076"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, asked who the hosts are and what they do. Hosts are organisations made up of the same sort of people who supported the patients&#146; forums. They can be voluntary organisations or social enterprises. The acid test is: do they know the field? Will they be able to be inclusive, to know who is able to or wants to make a contribution? Are they organisations that understand health and care matters? They could be an organisation in the field or a care provider, or a voluntary organisation dealing with health. They could also be a citizens&#146; advice bureau. We will have to see what comes forward and what capacity they offer the local authority. This is the test the local authority will impose. Can they do what we want? Are they sufficiently familiar, confident, trustworthy, open and capable to host and provide the infrastructure for this new organisation? We have not said what organisations should come forward for that reason. What happens if they go bust? There will be a rigorous process in awarding a contract but if they go bust, it will have to be retendered.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07072319000077"></a>Let me say something about commissioning. PCTs and local authorities have a duty to seek the views of local people, especially in commissioning decisions. LINks will be an ideal resource for commissioners to enable easy access to people who are interested and knowledgeable about that process. I think we have a natural synergy there.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07072319000078"></a>I have dealt with the hosts; let me come back to the notion of people. We do not think it is right that people should be identified in the legislation as having specific power or responsibilities. The intention of the legislation is to define the LINk&#146;s functions rather than how it should be managed or governed. As I have said, there will be different ways of doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07072319000079"></a>Amendment No. 238KF seeks to require that the activity of a LINk to monitor and review the commissioning and provision of services is for the purpose of securing  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_607"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 607</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and maintaining improvements to those services. I think the purpose is a good one. I can see the argument but I want to take this away and think about it, because getting something in the Bill about securing and maintaining improvements could be helpful. I have to consider how it could be applied to all of LINks&#146; powers rather than just one so there will be some implications to be teased out.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07072319000080"></a>Amendment No. 238L seeks to ensure that the list of LINks&#146; activities given in Clause 222(2) includes that the LINks can make their reports and recommendations to the bodies responsible for services. As it is currently drafted, subsection (2)(d) states that LINks can make,</p>
<ul><a name="07072319000153"></a>&#147;reports and recommendations ... to persons responsible for ... services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072319000133"></a>It is not necessary to amend that to read &#147;persons or bodies&#148; because, in the legal context, &#147;persons&#148; includes a body of persons and therefore applies to institutions that are responsible for services.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07072319000081"></a>The noble Earl asked whether LINks would be able to make reports&#151;require responses, as it were&#151;to the Healthcare Commission or CSCI. No; LINks will be able to make reports to regulators but they are not included in this list because they will not be under a duty to respond, as commissioners will be. There is a distinction. LINks reports are to be sent to local organisations that commission care services, not to national bodies, to emphasise the local LINk rather than the national commissioning body.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07072319000082"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 238KD and 238KH. I absolutely agree that it would be important for LINks to promote involvement opportunities to encompass the views of the entire population, as I said, including those who are hard to reach. The activities for a LINk listed under Clause 222(2) already include promoting people&#146;s involvement and obtaining views. The most reassuring thing that I can say to noble Lords is that we will be setting out in guidance the importance of doing that and collecting best practice about how it is already done.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07072319000083"></a>I will have to write to noble Lords about Amendment No. 238LE; I do not have the answers to hand.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07072319000084"></a>Finally, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked whether LINks will be able to consider transport or access to services. Yes, LINks will be able to hear many views on matters relating to healthcare; it will not be confined to the delivery of health services per se. It will cover all the things that make a difference to the way in which people access and perceive their health services.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07072319000085"></a>I am sorry; I seem to have spoken for quite a long time. I hope that I have given some of the answers that noble Lords were looking for.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07072319000094"></a>Hundreds&#151;potentially thousands&#151;of disabled people are being prevented from moving home or moving from residential care to independent living each year because of bureaucratic delays and disputes about who should pay for their care. The root cause of these problems is the definition of someone&#146;s place of ordinary residence. This is a means by which local authorities and primary care trusts determine which authority has responsibility for personal support for disabled people who live in their area. Local authorities are responsible for assessing the needs of and providing social care to people who are ordinary residents within their area. However, it is quite common for one local authority to place someone in registered accommodation within another local authority&#146;s area. Under these out-of-area placements, it is the placing local authority that pays for the personal support costs. If the individual then decides to move into more independent  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_609"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accommodation, their place of ordinary residence is deemed to have changed to where their new accommodation is located. The local authority should then take responsibility for their assessment and for funding personal support. However, there is no legal definition of ordinary residence and the guidance is unclear. The Department of Health said that it would update the guidance in 2004 but has not so far done so. Some local authorities are using this confusion to delay or avoid paying the costs of the care of those for whom they should be responsible.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07072319000095"></a>Situations in which disputes about ordinary residence arise include the following: first, when someone is funded as an out-or-area placement in a care home that ceases to be registered as a care home; secondly, when someone funded out of area leaves a residential college but wishes to stay in the vicinity of the college; thirdly, when someone receiving support to live in the community wishes to move to another authority area, perhaps just a mile or two away; and, fourthly, when someone who is assessed by a local authority moves to a home in another area on a self-funding basis and within a few weeks or months approaches the original authority for help with funding. I have been personally made aware of another complication in my role as chairman of RNIB, in respect of which I of course declare an interest. RNIB&#146;s Rushton School, which is now located near Coventry, receives numbers of children who are placed out of area from diverse regions of the country. Their educational and social care costs are met by the placing authority but for some reason Coventry PCT is expected to pick up the bill for the healthcare costs of all the children from around the country. These situations have major implications for local authorities. The current system creates clear winners and losers. Some local authorities have very few residential care facilities and therefore make a lot of out-of-area placements. Others are well served by residential care facilities and therefore receive a lot of out-of-area placements.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07072319000096"></a>There are perverse financial incentives for placing authorities to encourage disabled people living in registered care homes to move into the local community, or to encourage homes to de-register so that they no longer retain financial responsibility for their clients&#146; personal support costs. Those authorities in which large numbers of people have been placed face a significant increase in the numbers of disabled people needing support, with consequent budgetary implications. It is therefore essential that arrangements are put in place to ensure that these funding inequalities are resolved. Giving LINks the task of monitoring and reviewing provision in this area would help to give a voice to those stuck in the middle of these inter-authority disputes, many of whom are among those least able to make their voices heard. This is the purpose of Amendment No. 238LZA.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07072319000097"></a>Amendment No. 245B seeks to put in place a mechanism for arriving at a more systematic approach to resolving these problems. The Voluntary Organisations Disability Group, in a recent report entitled <I>No Place Like Home</I>, urges the Department of Health to take three urgent steps. First, to establish and enforce the principle that a person should receive appropriate social care and support from the authority where they  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_610"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are currently living or wish to live, regardless of circumstances. This would not deal with the Rushton problem, to which I referred, where the issue is one of disproportionate costs falling on a single authority because it happens to have within its boundaries a facility with a significant out-of-area&#151;for example, national or regional&#151;catchment. Perhaps a better way of putting it might be to say that it is a fundamental principle that the ability to change one&#146;s place of ordinary residence should not be contingent on health or social care needs.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07072319000098"></a>Secondly, guidance to social services and PCTs should be updated to ensure that they implement this principle in a person-centred way that removes barriers to choice and independence. Thirdly, a framework should be put in place for the transfer of funds between authorities so that the issue of ordinary residence can no longer be used as a basis for refusing to provide care and support.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07072319000099"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to give us some indication of the Government&#146;s approach to these matters, and how they propose to disentangle the intricacies to which they give rise. It cannot be doubted that there is a range of knotty problems overdue for solution here. If the Minister does not have an immediate answer, perhaps she would agree that it could be beneficial to meet with local authorities and the other bodies involved in providing social care and health services, with a view to finding a way forward that commands general assent. I beg to move.</p>

I particularly congratulate the noble Lord on highlighting a potentially very positive role for the new LINks in a future where they could be responsible for championing this key issue.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07072319000105"></a>I understand that Amendment No. 238LZA&#151;these are amazing titles for amendments&#151;seeks to ensure that LINks have an overview if, for example, a local authority wants to move someone to care home outside the area, or indeed if someone wants to move from one local authority area to another. They should have the right to social mobility.</p>

<a name="70723-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07072319000106"></a>I can confirm that the activities of a LINk, as they are described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Clause 222(2), apply to care commissioned and provided to people moving their place of ordinary residence into the area. The definition of local care services given in Clause 222(5) relates to care services provided in the authority&#146;s area and care services provided in any place for people from that area. Therefore, anyone living even temporarily within a given local authority area should be able to share their experiences of care services with the LINk for that area, even if the services they receive are from outside that area. Any healthcare commissioned by the PCT will fall under the remit of the corresponding LINk, even if it is provided in, for example, a prison. I know we are going to talk about that later.</p>

Local authorities should be under a duty to co-operate in, for example, the sharing of needs assessments to facilitate and speed up payments if people move from area to area. I thank noble Lords for highlighting these issues around the question of mobility for disabled people and local authorities&#146; responsibilities in this area. I agree that these are extremely complex and important issues and that they merit more detailed examination. I shall be pleased to take away the points raised by noble Lords today and will ask the Department of Health to discuss them with key organisations, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, has suggested. I know, for example, that the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group is particularly keen to meet to discuss these matters. I shall recommend that such a meeting takes place and shall be happy to bring pressure to bear in that regard or at least, for noble Lords who are discussing the issue here today, to press for significant progress to have been made before Report. With that in mind, I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07072319000118"></a>The power to make regulations set out in subsections (3) and (4) already requires the Secretary of State to consult such persons as he considers necessary. However, it is important to state that there is no intention of using these regulations in the near future. The power to make regulations has been taken simply to ensure that LINks activities can be kept up to date in the future. For example, if health and social care services change&#151; perhaps with the announcement of major reforms&#151;we want to ensure that LINks have enough flexibility so that the effectiveness of their activities is not restricted. We said that forums are now ill-suited to meet the changes because there needs to be a wider, more inclusive network, but what we have learnt from patients&#146; forums is very valuable and we certainly do not intend to lose that knowledge.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07072319000119"></a>The regulation-making powers are unlikely to be used soon, and patients&#146; forums will no longer exist if and when regulations are made to add to the powers of LINks. Amendments Nos. 238VB and 238VC seek a similar end when regulations are made detailing the duties of service providers to respond to requests for information made by LINks. Again, the Secretary of State must consult the members of patients&#146; forums.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07072319000120"></a>We shortly intend to make regulations on how service providers should respond to LINks, unlike the regulation-making power in Clause 222. We intend to draw up draft regulations and, in the next few months, will begin a full three-month consultation on the various powers, such as the power to review or to request information. It is absolutely our intention that that consultation should involve important stakeholders from many sectors. Many people who are interested in how LINks will work will have valuable opinions, and we do not wish to make patients&#146; forums a statutory consultee because we do not think that the consultation should be limited to that group. It would seem unwise to retain them as statutory consultees once they were abolished, but they obviously contain important expertise.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07072319000121"></a>The transition to the new system will be evolutionary. It is a new system and that is part of the argument for the way that things are being done. It is a new system  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_614"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 614</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rather than an amendment of the old system. As we say in the document on making effective LINks, there is no reason at all why forum members, as part of LINks, cannot continue to build on the often positive relationships that they have formed with specific NHS trusts, which, in many instances, have been valued on both sides. Specifically, LINks members will be able to form specialist sub-groups focusing on areas that include hospital trusts, mental health trusts and so on, as well as focusing on LINk-wide commissioning issues at PCT or local authority levels. That will build on best practice.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07072319000122"></a>I firmly believe that many people who have built up relationships and trust with those organisations will want, and need, to continue to be involved. Therefore, not only will they be consulted in respect of what the noble Baroness raised in her amendment but they will have a role in making LINks, and the flexibility in the system, work according to the good sense and interest of the institutions. I very much hope that patients&#146; forums will take that message in the spirit in which it is meant. We need the expertise and commitment to continue, and I very much hope that it will.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_615"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 615</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>subject of money. Through this amendment, I want to raise a number of questions for the Minister about the resourcing of LINks.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07072325000009"></a>We understand that funding is to be made available to local authorities by the Department of Health to enable the host organisations to support LINks and their activities. If, as I imagine, that funding is not to be ring-fenced&#151;though the Minister may correct me&#151;the obvious question arises about whether the activities undertaken in a local authority area in the name of patient and public involvement will be adequate in any given case. If it is open to local authorities to apply money intended to support that involvement to other activities altogether, we have the prospect&#151;or, at any rate, the possibility&#151;of LINks being supported on a mere shoestring and, therefore, not being able to do their job properly.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07072325000010"></a>We will be debating the role of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health in later amendments, but one signal advantage of the commission is that the money that it distributes to forum support organisations cannot be used for purposes other than those for which forums were established. Under the arrangements in the Bill, however, there is no guarantee at all that money intended to support the activities listed in Clause 222 will actually reach the front line. It would be possible for a local authority to say that it was delivering the activities in the Bill when, in reality, those activities were so minimal that they were hardly worth the name of patient and public involvement. What steps could be taken, in those circumstances, to ensure that such involvement in health and social care is delivered properly? The answer is not clear from the Bill.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07072325000011"></a>Another aspect to this issue is that, if LINks are going to assume different forms and guises in different localities, it is axiomatic that the level of activity that they undertake is going to vary from area to area. That will not only be because the activities themselves naturally give rise to a different burden of work in different parts of the country; it will also reflect the size and composition of the LINks, which may be large and diverse in one area and thin and perhaps weak in another. The amount of money directed toward PPI in any given area has to be based on a reasonably objective and dispassionate assessment of what that area needs in order for the job of PPI to be done properly and effectively. This is not to advocate the conscious overfunding of LINks that may be a bit thin and weak. My point is that the budget for the host contract has to be arrived at on the basis of what is, and what might be, needed to deliver desired outcomes.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07072325000012"></a>How is that aim to be achieved? Again, the Bill is extremely vague and uninformative. What considerations will underpin the process whereby a local authority judges that funding of a host for a given year should, let us say, go up? If it reaches such a judgment, what factors will the Department of Health look to if it is to persuade the Treasury that additional funding should be provided? Whatever process is employed here needs to be transparent and fair, not least as between different parts of the country.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07072325000013"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could shed some illumination on those issues. Also, what total amount of funding has been earmarked by the Department of

Is it less or more than the amount currently granted to the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, and how has the budgeted amount been arrived at? Does she believe that more funds will find their way to host organisations than currently goes to forum support organisations and, if she does, how much more money will there be?</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07072325000014"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to give us at least a measure of reassurance that there will indeed be a budget comparable in size to the present one and that the effect of all these changes is that we will see worthwhile amounts of money released to the front line, as adumbrated in her letter to noble Lords of 9 July. I beg to move.</p>

The reason for the amendment is that some 10 or so days ago the noble Earl and I went to see the Minister in another place, Ann Keen. It was a new innovation to be asked to see the Minister together, rather than our separate parties being seen separately. At that meeting, we raised the issue of employment&#151;who decides whether a LINk will be able to employ people and at what point. As yet, I have not been fully satisfied on that point.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07072325000016"></a>In discussion with Ministers, we have been assured time and again that a LINk will ultimately be able to employ people, even though the contracts may be held elsewhere. We have also been told that that will not be the case yet, because at the moment the host will do that at the setting-up stage. I would like the Minister to assure us that LINks will be able to employ people&#151;she might already have said that&#151;and perhaps when this will be so. Indeed, will contracts have to be held elsewhere, by the host, say, rather than by the LINk itself? That would be a considerable clarification, along with reassurance that there will be adequate money available to do it all.</p>

If I may say so, I thought that the questions asked by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, were absolutely spot on. I want to probe a tiny bit further on the point about ring-fencing, which is important. If we had assurances on that, we would have rather more confidence in what is being proposed. What will be the basis of the funding? Do the Government intend that there will be a careful look at the residents of a particular area, and their needs, quite apart from the needs that are being spelt out as the LINks get under way? It would be important to know that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07072325000018"></a>Another thing that worries me slightly is what happens if there is a fallout between the host and the LINk and they do not agree about what is being done&#151;the host may not much want to endorse it and might get a bit critical that what it hoped for is not being achieved. Those are the sort of things that I hope are being looked at and thought about. These will be opinionated groups with all sorts of different priorities, which will not necessarily be acceptable

There are some problems, which, presumably, the Government are thinking through.</p>

Thirdly, if so, how will that be controlled by the local authority so that as much money as possible goes to the front line? I have totally forgotten what the next question was, so I apologise. No, I know. It is about power sharing. Clearly, if a host is going to undertake this, it might be doing so for financial gain or for influence. Will the guidance ensure that there is a wide diversity of interest, rather than a narrowness of interest held by a particular host?</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07072325000021"></a>Perhaps I may briefly go over the process. We think that giving local authorities the duty to establish LINks for procurement of hosts fits very well into the whole notion of devolution of power to local authorities in the Bill. It is right that this provision should be at local level and not delivered from a central body, which is exactly what we do not want to do.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07072325000022"></a>I have to resist for predictable reasons the proposal to put in the Bill a requirement on the Secretary of State to ensure that sufficient funds are available to cover the costs of a local authority and its work to put in place contractual arrangements to enable the establishment of LINk activities. As noble Lords know, the intention is that the Secretary of State will make a grant to each local authority to enable it to procure a host organisation to support the LINk and to fund its activities.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07072325000023"></a>Although the exact amount of these grants is still subject to the Comprehensive Spending Review&#151;a mantra that is being echoed across all government departments&#151;we have said that the total amount available for the new system of LINks should be equal to what is currently spent on patient forums. The noble Earl asked whether the amount of money will be comparable. The answer is yes. That will initially take the form of a three-year grant. It is not ring-fenced. There is nothing perverse in that. It is not ring-fenced because we have moved away from the ideology of ring-fencing. Indeed, the whole notion of local area agreements, to which we are moving in the Bill, is to have flexible pots that can enable services to support each other and draw on a much more coherent and explicit form of support.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07072325000024"></a>The funding will be explicitly targeted to ensure the purpose of making arrangements to establish a LINk. This will be visible; it will be discrete; and I am sure that it will be observed. In making the grant, the Secretary of State will assess what levels of funding will be necessary to cover the costs of each local authority. Obviously, this must be grounded in local realities. I hope that the noble Earl is reassured when I  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_618"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 618</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>say that we are working with local authority representatives as well as with the Local Government Association to determine realistic budgets that will cover costs associated with administering and monitoring contracts. That will vary according to the nature of the area. Size is clearly a factor. Birmingham will have a very different set of requirements from those of a unitary authority such as Thurrock.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07072325000025"></a>The amendment of the noble Earl seems to present an irresistible argument, but I must resist it because, if I were to give in, it would be customary from here on to have a passage in every piece of legislation stating that funding would be sufficient. That then raises the question of who would be the statutory judge of whether the funds were sufficient. We are entering a minefield here. The Secretary of State will consider how much each local authority needs and will make a judgment as to the level of funds necessary, informed, as I have said, in these different ways about how the local authority can comply with its duty. The factors will be demographic&#151;the nature of the population and the size of the area. I hope that that will meet the criteria of fairness, because it will certainly be a transparent process. We want LINks to work. We are not setting them up to fail. We want them to be as effective as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07072325000026"></a>Proposed new subsection (4B) aims to allow local authorities to spend more on making contractual arrangements than the allocation provided for by the Secretary of State. That is a very important suggestion. Equally, it is very important that arrangements for LINks should allow for the possibility of additional funds being available from whatever sources exist. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent local authorities from making additional funds available for LINk activities. If, for example, they wanted to add to funding for LINks from their own engagement activities, I could see that there would be an argument. In the Bill, local authorities are under a duty to involve, inform and consult local people. If we can get some synergy, there may well be some possibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07072325000027"></a>Amendment No. 238N is difficult to understand. It seems to take away a fundamental plank in the process of establishing a LINk; that is, the power for a local authority to make payments to a host. I am not sure whether I have missed something very important or subtle, but I cannot see any benefit in removing that provision because, as I have said, we think that it is vital that a host is created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07072325000028"></a>Amendment No. 238QA seeks to ensure that the arrangements that the local authority makes with the host provide that the LINk has the necessary staff, premises and so on. This is a logical amendment in relation to the earlier one. I do not believe that it is necessary because I think that the whole point of the contractual arrangement, which we set out in the model contract, is precisely to state the types of support that the host is expected to give the LINk. It could be minimal, it could involve staff, support and premises, but it will vary. Every contract must reflect local realities. We are issuing a model contract specification. It is not mandatory but it is a guide to help tailoring in

The local authority will be under a legal duty to make contractual arrangements with a host to ensure that LINks activities can be undertaken. The safeguard is there.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07072325000029"></a>On Amendment No. 238SA, the noble Baroness asked whether it will be possible for LINks to employ their own staff and decide such issues as pay and so on. I can certainly give her an assurance that it will be possible, as the provisions already allow for a LINk to be any sort of body, including one that can employ its own staff. I am thinking of companies limited by guarantee or charities with employment status.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07072325000030"></a>A more difficult question is when. It is difficult to say, because in some instances the contract could be held by the host immediately, but it would be explicit from the start that the LINks would want to do the employment. It would be in the nature of the contract. There will be LINks organisations that will grow in confidence and that may feel a year or two into the scheme that it is right for them to take over the employment functions. The provision has to be as flexible as that. I cannot see a problem with that. I do not think that we would want to prescribe this. I shall look at the matter again and come back to the noble Baroness if I think that there are ambiguities.</p>

She said the organisation could be a charity. If these LINks become charities, will have the same status as other charities in their area and therefore be able to raise funds externally? Will they therefore be in competition with all the other charities, although they are delivering what has previously been a statutory function for things like the lottery? If this has not been thought through, can it be thought through before it becomes an issue?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07072325000035"></a>With regard to the noble Baroness&#146;s other question, we see no reason why this should not happen straightaway. But given the embryonic nature of the organisations, it is more likely that they will want to wait until they

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07072325000036"></a>The noble Baroness asked what would happen if hosts and LINks fall out. I cannot imagine that that would ever happen, but LINks will have the opportunity to put their views and concerns directly to the local authority. The contract has got to be deliverable; if LINks finds that its host organisation is doing something that disables it in some way, it would be right and proper for it to go to the local authority and say, &#147;Look, this contract is not being managed in the way it should be&#148;. That is part of the performance management built into the situation.</p>

<a name="70723-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07072325000037"></a>I have answered most of the questions. It is worth reiterating that this legislation is very permissive and we need to preserve in the arrangements for LINks the duty of the local authority to take a view as to what is necessary. We are talking about minimal levels of support, or it may be a sophisticated arrangement that will either be designed in or will emerge over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07072325000038"></a>I have a note asking whether local authorities will be able to produce some grants to pay for the costs. This refers to management costs.

We will come back to this point and will look at the legal implications of that.</p>

The NHS now has responsibility for prison health. I quote from a statement made by my noble friend Lady Murphy:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="07072325000106"></a>&#147;Prisons are like swamps providing the breeding grounds for the mosquitoes of disadvantage ... the revolving prison gate feeds further public health problems back into localised communities. If we are serious about narrowing the health inequalities of our most disadvantaged communities, prisons are a very good place to start&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> 10/11/05; col. 802.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07072325000100"></a>Improving healthcare of prisoners can also have the positive effect of reducing and preventing reoffending&#151;a key government target. Prisons have a cross-section of health issues and there is a vital need for good through-put in healthcare within prisons and good links with the communities they go out to if there are ongoing health problems. There must be suitable communication.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07072325000046"></a>One of the most difficult problems in prisons is the dual diagnosis of mental health and addiction. There are also sometimes other problems, such as sickle cell disease. There is a huge drug and alcohol addiction problem in prisons. It must be treated within prisons and links with the communities are needed so that rehabilitation can continue. All adult prisons now have CARATS&#151;counselling, assessment, referral, advice and through-care services. This is certainly an improvement, but health issues within prisons need more flexibility and working in co-operation with each other. Prisoners come into prisons very often and nearly always with no health records. Communication about their health needs improvement. Health facilities within prisons, such as the building of a treatment room, take a very long time to establish as the issue is surrounded by unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy. That frustrates prison staff when they know that there is money available.</p>

It will be one of the roles of the host organisation to ensure that the views of all parts of the community are sought, and therefore LINks will certainly want to seek the views of prisoners and, for example, asylum seekers in detention centres on the health and social care services they receive or might receive. We want to encourage everyone in the community to become involved in LINks and ensure that a wide range of views are proactively gathered and fed in to those who commission and provide care services.</p>

Therefore, anyone living even temporarily within a given local authority area will fall under the remit of the LINk and should be able to share their experiences of the care services they have received with the LINk for that area, even if the services they receive are from outside it. Any healthcare commissioned by the PCT will fall under the remit of a LINk, even if it is provided in a prison.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07072325000059"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, at the end of 2005, the Government carried out a full public consultation on the issue of political donations in Northern Ireland.  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_623"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 623</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Their response to the consultation exercise was published in January 2006. It outlined a number of measures that were later given legislative effect in the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of the same year. The Act is, as I am sure noble Lords are aware, the parent Act of the order before us today. Since it received Royal Assent in July last year, we have had a series of discussions with the Irish Government and the Electoral Commission on the detail of how the new donations arrangements in Northern Ireland will work, and the order seeks to give effect to those discussions. I am fully aware&#151;and indeed I am reminded of it as I read my notes&#151;of the concerns that some expressed about these provisions during the passage of the 2006 Act, and in the recent debate on this order in the other place, and I know that those concerns are shared by some noble Lords here today. Given that, I should like to set out the detail of the order in context as clearly as possible.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07072325000060"></a>Until now, the source of donations to political parties in Northern Ireland has been completely unregulated. The provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 which banned foreign donations and introduced a system of public reporting of donations in the United Kingdom were disapplied from Northern Ireland. Donations have been permitted in Northern Ireland from anywhere in the world and the Electoral Commission has not been notified about who donates what. This exemption was for what we considered to be sound reasons&#151;concerns relating to the possible intimidation of donors to political parties in the event of their identities being made public, and to allow Northern Ireland recipients to accept donations from Ireland in a manner consistent with the spirit of the Good Friday agreement.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07072325000061"></a>However, in 2005 we concluded that the time was right to introduce effective regulation of donations in Northern Ireland in order to inject some transparency into the system. The Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 therefore made provision for political parties registered in the Northern Ireland register and regulated donees, known collectively as &#147;Northern Ireland recipients&#148;, to continue to be exempt from the provisions relating to the control of political donations which are set out in Part IV of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 for one final period. Under Section 11 of the 2006 Act, that period of disapplication expires on 31 October this year. From 1 November, all of Part 4 of the 2000 Act will apply to Northern Ireland for the first time, but with two significant modifications. First, Northern Ireland recipients will continue to be able to receive donations not only from all existing permissible donors under the 2000 Act, but also from Irish citizens and prescribed Irish bodies. Secondly, Northern Ireland donation reports will be held confidentially and checked privately by the Electoral Commission for an initial period of three years, or longer if extended by order of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07072325000062"></a>It is worth repeating a point I made during the passage of the 2006 Act: these changes, whatever is said about them, represent a very considerable narrowing of the regime that exists at present. I should repeat that the present system allows Northern Ireland recipients  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_624"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 624</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to accept donations from anybody of any nationality resident anywhere on the planet. What is more, they do not have to report them to any regulatory body. Any move from that to introduce more transparency and a degree of regulation will represent a narrowing of the regime. The confidentiality arrangements in relation to Northern Ireland reports which are set out in the order are temporary. The Act provides that they will fall away in 2010, bringing Northern Ireland even further into line with Great Britain. Although the period is extended by order it is our firm hope that, when the time comes, we will not have to seek Parliament&#146;s approval to do so.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07072325000063"></a>The provisions enabling Northern Ireland recipients to continue to accept donations from Irish citizens and Irish bodies meeting prescribed conditions are contained in the 2006 Act and are, by contrast, permanent. This order simply puts flesh on the bones of Part 3 of last year&#146;s Act by setting out precisely what the conditions are, how the Electoral Commission may verify the source of any donation, and what steps it can take if impermissible donations are found to have been accepted. The provisions of the 2006 Act are in line with the original recommendations of the Neill committee which gave rise to the 2000 Act in the first place: that because of the special role of Ireland in Northern Ireland&#146;s political life, as set out in the Belfast agreement and elsewhere, it would not be right to ban contributions from there. In contrast to the position on confidentiality of donations, which as I have said we hope will no longer be relevant in 2010, we do not see any circumstances in which the recommendation in relation to Irish donations is going to lose its relevance at any point in the near future. For this reason, the measures in the 2006 Act and this order to meet this recommendation are not time-limited. But the order-making power in the 2006 Act allows us to vary widely, with the consent of Parliament, who should qualify as an Irish donor.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07072325000064"></a>As I have indicated, the order puts flesh on the bones of the relevant provisions and I will briefly summarise them. Part 1 of the order specifies the conditions which an Irish citizen must meet in order to be able to donate to a Northern Ireland recipient. It also specifies the categories of Irish bodies which will be entitled to donate to Northern Ireland recipients from 1 November onwards.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07072325000065"></a>Schedule 1 sets out the information which must be provided in relation to donations from Irish donors in donation reports from Northern Ireland recipients. The steps which the Electoral Commission must take in order to verify the information contained in the donation reports submitted by Northern Ireland recipients are set out in Part 2 of the order. The Electoral Commission must check 50 per cent of donations from individuals and 100 per cent of donations from bodies reported by Northern Ireland recipients. It may verify the information provided in the donation reports by, among other things, contacting the bodies listed in Article 11 to which it is able to disclose information. For example, the commission could contact the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission to verify information relating to payments made under the Financial Assistance for Political Parties Act (Northern Ireland) 2000 or  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_625"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 625</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could contact the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in relation to companies registered in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07072325000066"></a>The commission is under a duty of confidentiality in relation to information contained in reports from Northern Ireland recipients during the prescribed period. However, the commission has the power under the 2000 Act, as modified by last year&#146;s Act, to release information contained in a Northern Ireland donation report if it believes on reasonable grounds that the donation was from an impermissible or unidentifiable donor.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07072325000067"></a>Article 10 sets out the requirements in relation to which such information must be released. The commission would release the amount of the donation and the party to which it was made but not the identity of the donor. This is in recognition of the fact there may be circumstances in which the publication of a donor&#146;s personal details&#151;their name and address&#151;could lead to a threat to that individual&#146;s life.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07072325000068"></a>It was suggested in the debate in the other place that if this order was not passed the relevant measures in the miscellaneous provisions Act would fall away on 31 October. I stress that this is not the case. If this order fails to pass, the relevant sections of the 2006 Act would still take effect on 1 November this year; however, without the details of this order the new regime would not work effectively. For example, no provision would be made about the contents of donation reports which relate to Irish donations, and there would be no mechanism in place for the Electoral Commission to check both Irish and UK donations to Northern Ireland recipients during the prescribed period. This would mean that while Northern Ireland recipients would be required to submit donation reports in relation to donations from the UK and not those from Ireland, these reports would not be scrutinised properly. I am sure noble Lords agree that would be very undesirable.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07072325000069"></a>I should also like to clear up any potential misunderstanding concerning the issue of Northern Ireland parties being able to pass on Irish donations to their counterpart parties in Great Britain. There are two separate registers of political parties&#151;one each for Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A party may be registered in both the Great Britain and the Northern Ireland registers, but in such a case it is treated as two separate registered parties. This was set out in the original legislation in 2000.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07072325000070"></a>New Section 71C of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which was inserted by Section 12 of the 2006 Act, further prevents parties registered in Northern Ireland making donations to parties registered in Great Britain or to regulated donees in Great Britain. The effect of this is that Irish citizens and prescribed bodies meeting the prescribed conditions will be able to donate only to parties registered in the Northern Ireland register. This means that there is no back door by which Irish donations can legitimately reach parties registered in Great Britain. They would be classified as foreign donations&#151;it is as simple as that&#151;and would be ruled out. That was the position established by the 2000 Act and the 2006 Act maintains that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07072325000074"></a>To deal first with the temporary exemption, which is perhaps of less deep significance, the Government had obviously hoped that by this point they would be in a position to remove confidentiality protection of the kind that exists in Northern Ireland electoral law and to have complete transparency along the lines of the United Kingdom. It is not the Government&#146;s fault that we are not quite at that point. The violence at the weekend in Carrickfergus reminds us of the ways in which Northern Ireland still, despite the enormous progress made, does not have the degree of stability and peace that there is throughout the rest of the United Kingdom. None the less, although the Government&#146;s position is understandable, the consequence of what has been said here today is that it is most likely that the next general election will be fought in a context in which confidentiality will apply to Northern Ireland electoral donations which will not apply in the rest of the United Kingdom. It is important to keep that in mind.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07072325000075"></a>More significant, however, is the Government&#146;s view on the question of allowing Irish citizens to contribute to Northern Irish political parties. This goes against the basic principle of exclusion of foreign donations in our mainstream UK legislation. Irish citizenship is defined in the Irish constitution extraterritorially; it can mean Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, but also in the United States of America. As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, was honest enough to say to the Grand Committee in June 2006, there are a lot of Irish citizens around the world. This is opening a very wide door.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07072325000076"></a>I was quite surprised to see in another place&#151;and to a degree repeated today by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker&#151;the argument from the Government that opposition to or concern on this matter reflects a failure to grasp the core principles of the Good Friday agreement. The Good Friday agreement is quite correct;  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_627"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it gives a legitimacy to people who consider themselves British or Irish or both. However, this provision gives a legitimacy to those who consider themselves American or Irish or both. It is not quite in line with the Good Friday agreement; it creates in principle a new privileged type of donor. That argument surprised me when I first heard it, but the more I reflected upon it the more it surprised me.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07072325000077"></a>Since 1994 I have been a vigorous advocate of the principles of the Good Friday agreement. These principles today are accepted by all the parties in this House; they are accepted&#151;with a degree of reservation by some perhaps&#151;by 108 Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly; and they are accepted by both the British and Irish Governments. In 1994 this was far from being the case. Those of us who argued for it found ourselves often in a lonely place and often opposed, it would appear, by the majority in both communities in Northern Ireland, and certainly by the majority of the parties which currently dominate the Northern Ireland Executive. Now things have changed and I am very grateful for that.</p>

<a name="70723-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07072325000078"></a>However, it is also remembering that in 1994 the Labour Party found itself in an ambiguous position on some of these questions, as indeed did the Irish Government. The argument for this legislation cannot be found in the Good Friday agreement, although it can be found in the broader logic of the peace process more generally. I am prepared to accept that. The Government would have been more honest with us if they had expressed themselves in those terms.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07072325000079"></a>In certain respects, though, the argument as presented today actually constitutes a regression from the key principles of the Good Friday agreement. One of the things the agreement does is remove the difficulties that arose from the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement, which created an unhappy marriage between British and Irish constitutional thinking in which it emerged that, for example, a common-or-garden phrase like &#147;the status of Northern Ireland&#148; meant an entirely different thing in Irish constitutional theory from what it meant in British constitutional theory. It was not until 1998, thanks in part to the labour of noble Lords in this House today&#151;I refer to the noble Lords, Lord Trimble, Lord Laird, Lord Kilclooney and Lord Maginnis, and others&#151;that eventually this matter was sorted out by the Good Friday agreement, the referendum that led to a change in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution and the victory of the principle of consent, the guiding principle now accepted by all which governs the politics and the future of Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07072325000080"></a>The key point is that we are now regressing. On one hand we have a formula in the Irish constitution, extra-territorially defined citizenship, which is extremely broad and is something the British Government have no right to expect to be able to define. We are returning to the uneasy world of 1985 to 1998, when the British Government found themselves locked in to meanings that were defined by the constitutional text of another state. I almost said that we were returning to the dark days of Thatcherism in that respect. It would have been better if the argument had been made on a different ground; that is, on the ground of the broader logic of the peace process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07072325000081"></a>I also think that the House has found it easier to accept the provisions because the party that is expected to benefit the most, Sinn Fein, does not appear in the House of Commons. We cannot assume that that will continue for ever. Such is the pace of ideological revisionism within Sinn Fein&#146;s political leadership that it is quite conceivable that it will appear in the Commons within the next few years, and should it do so, it would be a step that I would welcome. However, a consequence would be that, possibly in the context of a hung Parliament, a key group of MPs&#151;which might decide the colour of the next Government, on the polls as they existed a month ago, if not today&#151;would be elected in the context of an electoral law totally different from that governing the other Members of that House.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07072325000082"></a>It is not enough to say that we can prevent transfers of money from Northern Irish parties to British parties. The consequence of this legislation goes further: it will create a different type of Member. So far that type of Member does not appear, but they may appear soon and that might affect how Governments operate. It is important to say that, because many of the concerns about Sinn Fein in politics and its financing have disappeared or been greatly reduced because of its relatively weak performance in the recent Irish general election. But although many noble Lords might devoutly wish it, the affairs and representatives of Northern Ireland cannot be kept in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07072325000083"></a>A Pandora&#146;s box has been opened here. I understand the reasons why the Government have decided to do it. There are justifications in terms of the peace process and of the process that has persuaded the Sinn Fein leadership to give up violence and endorse politics, which are overriding considerations, and the greatest justification of all is the saving of human life that has occurred as a result of that policy. In that respect the Government are on firm ground, but they should not hide from themselves that there is a downside and an ambiguity to what is taking place, to which we will have to pay attention over the years that follow.</p>

He is indeed a professor of Irish politics at Queen&#146;s, and has been part of Irish politics and all those things that have happened for probably the past 40 years.

My party, as the Minister made clear he understands in his clear outlining of the order, is not totally happy about what is happening. The Northern Ireland Office seems to have done a lot of work to fill one of the gaps I was worried about, which was that money could flow in from almost anywhere, as the noble Lord, Lord Bew, said. There are Irish citizens all over the world, and money could flow from them into Ireland and into the  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_629"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 629</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>parties in Northern Ireland. However, it was new to me tonight when I heard it, although it probably should not have been, that money cannot flow out from Northern Ireland into England, Scotland or Wales. As a Conservative in Northern Ireland I am rather disappointed about that; I thought we might have pulled an advantage over the Government. I wondered why the Labour Party was giving serious consideration to setting up in Northern Ireland. I thought maybe it was joining us in having a way into this potential pot of gold. But it seems that is not to be.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07072325000086"></a>I am sad that parts of the order are permanent. I believe it will need reviewing again. Like the noble Lord, Lord Bew, I find it pessimistic that we are still saying we cannot do the same in Northern Ireland as we can in the rest of the United Kingdom because, because. We must grasp the issue. The Government have grasped it pretty well for a while, and we must not let them start slipping back from it on matters that might be a little uncomfortable. I see no reason why the disciplines should not be operated in Northern Ireland the same as they are here, or why Irish citizens should be allowed to fund Northern Irish parties unless they are clearly domiciled within the 32 counties&#151;I can see some right in that. But there is no right in any Irish citizen holding an Irish passport being able to ship money from anywhere in the world through the Bank of Ireland into wherever. I hope the Minister will be able to tell me that the homework has been done thoroughly there, and that only those people who are registered on an electoral roll in the Republic of Ireland and are inhabitants and taxpayers thereof will be in a position to move money to parties in the north.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07072325000087"></a>Overall we support the bulk of the order, but there are loopholes in it that still need to be tightened up, and the permanence of some aspects of it are disappointing. I have a final question. In the Republic, can we ship money down to Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the other political parties there? If the Conservative Party or the Labour Party wished to help to fund a campaign, or some of our wealthier members&#151;I think there are more wealthy members on the government side than on our side these days&#151;chose to help and support Fianna Fáil for their own reasons, or political reasons, could they do that?</p>

There are some unsatisfactory features, which all sides recognise, in these exemptions applying to Northern Ireland. There is a way we can contrive to deal with it. The Northern Ireland Assembly should have an upper Chamber, suitably adapted from the Celtic House of Druids, and people could buy their appointment to it by donating to the nearest parties and joining the legislature.

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07072325000090"></a>Only slightly more seriously, this continuing exemption is offensive for many of the reasons raised by the noble Lords, Lord Bew and Lord Glentoran. I have one question for the Minister. Article 3 of the order refers to someone being eligible to obtain an Irish passport, or certificates of nationality or naturalisation. That is a very loose, weasel phrase. Anyone can say, &#147;I&#146;m sure I am eligible to obtain one of these things&#148;. This loose wording is most unsatisfactory. Will the Minister kindly explain how that will be tightly defined rather than being an open-ended mere gesture?</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07072325000091"></a>Otherwise, with reluctance, we on these Benches accept, given the exigencies of Northern Ireland, that this exemption should be allowed. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that I do not want these provisions to be set in concrete. We should review them in four or five years&#146; time to see how things are working because we hope that by then, Northern Ireland democracy will have matured enough not to need these loopholes. Very reluctantly, we support the order.</p>

It cannot. This flies against the letter and the spirit of the agreement. The noble Lord who made the assertions was unable, of course, to provide any justification for them. The agreement recognises the rights of individual persons to regard themselves as British or Irish but it confers no constitutional rights on them. Instead, in constitutional terms, the agreement explicitly recognises that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom. It recognises the legitimacy of that; it even recognises explicitly the power of this Parliament to legislate and that that power is in no way untrammelled. It is quite wrong to say that that agreement gives Ireland a special place in the domestic affairs of Northern Ireland&#151;it does not. There is a special relationship through the North/South Ministerial Council and those arrangements, and that was the concession that we made to Irish national feeling. It is quite wrong for the Government to go further than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07072325000094"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, is quite right that the approach taken by the Minister is a repudiation of the principles of the agreement and a regression to the worst things that went before. I feel very strongly about this matter; the House will have to come back to it again. The Government will have to stop being seduced by people offering some notion of the spirit or logic of the agreement. The agreement is clear, it has a text, and it ought to be respected. It is wrong for

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07072325000095"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, said that he could accept this as somehow part of the peace process. Let me unpack that phrase. What that means is not the agreement and not anything derived from the agreement, but the manoeuvres that have been necessary to persuade paramilitaries to give up violence and enter into the political process. This peace process did so much damage to popular confidence in the agreement. It was because of this other process, quite apart from the political processes set apart in the agreement, that one saw the Government making improper concessions to those who had been involved in violence. I mean &#147;improper&#148; in the sense of not being justified by the agreement that we made, which is, or ought to be, the settlement of these things. From 1998, that agreement has been regularly undermined by the Government making concessions not justified by the agreement to those involved in violence as a means of weaning them away from it. In other words, it has been done as a result of a perceived threat from them. We should be long past this; we should not be back in this territory. I recall how a leading member of the Democratic Unionist Party said in 2003 that if one were to vote for that party on Thursday, the concessions would stop on Friday. Here we are in 2007, and yet another concession is being made to the men of violence. I hope that the noble Baroness who represents the DUP will tell us why it has acquiesced in yet another unnecessary concession to the republicans. I will not prolong my comments so as to ensure that she has the opportunity to do that.</p>

I am concerned about the special position that is constantly given to the Irish in the affairs of Northern Ireland. I have had experience directly from the Belfast agreement of dealing with Irish officialdom and it is not particularly pleasant. Unfortunately, in Northern Ireland we have allowed very low standards of Irish governance to come into our part of the United Kingdom, ensuring a lack of proper procedures in many important areas such as recruitment to public bodies. It is unacceptable and we should fight it on every possible occasion.</p>

A lot of money flows through to the coffers of Sinn Fein/IRA from illegal activities. Where is the money that was taken from the Northern Bank? Where is the &#163;365 million per year lost to the Revenue by fuel laundering in Northern Ireland? Is that the money that backed up the election campaign which Sinn Fein ran in the Irish Republic and which, thank goodness, was a total disaster for that party and has perhaps set a new climate of opinion on the island of Ireland about the way forward?</p>

Secondly, I say in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, that my party never gave any concessions to Sinn Fein, as he has accused us of doing. For the first time in its history, Sinn Fein has had to sign up to support the police. It has also decided to sign up, or was brought to the point of doing so by my party, to support the courts of law and order, which it had never done previously. We welcome that. We said that, if it signed up to those things, we would take the matter further. Sinn Fein wanted to sign up only to ordinary police, which would have meant paramilitary policing in its style, not policing as we know it, and we all know what that means.</p>

For the first time, Sinn Fein has welcomed the chief of police to the Falls Road, which we all know is a 100 per cent republican area. That was never done before. So I do not see where the concessions lie or where we have given in. We have brought Sinn Fein along and things have changed whether we like it or not.</p>

People from England and other parts of the world who have previously visited Northern Ireland have seen the change, too, and we look forward to greater changes.

We will continue to fight for the rights of the people in Northern Ireland, for the defence of the police and, by them, of the courts of law and order.</p>

It would be unfair to say that we were held to ransom, but they cut a deal, saw their opportunities and who could blame them? I digress, but, as I have said, I have made no attempt to sugar-coat the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07072327000010"></a>I shall do my best to answer the specific questions, all of which were quite legitimate. The noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked about loans. There will be provisions for loans. They will be complicated. Frankly, we could not have done it in the order. We have changed the rules and we have changed the legislation on loans anyway. The provisions of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, which relate to the regulation of loans, have yet to be commenced for Northern Ireland, although they have already commenced for Great Britain. We hope to commence them later this year. We do not have to legislate; it is a question of getting a commencement order up and running. The legislation has been made. Northern Ireland was included, but the legislation did not commence there at the same time as in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07072327000011"></a>I go back to what I said earlier about the Neill committee, whose work gave rise to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000&#151;a very important piece of legislation, of which the Government can be rightly proud. The Neill committee, among other things,  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_634"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 634</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recommended that because of the special role of Ireland in Northern Ireland&#146;s political life as set out in the Belfast agreement, it would not be right to ban contributions from there. I shall go no further than that. There was another view of that issue.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07072327000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, mentioned the Conservative Party organising in Northern Ireland. It is not for me to offer advice to the Conservative Party, but I think that it would be better off trying to organise in places such as Ealing Southall than bothering with Northern Ireland at present. I know that I should not have said that, but I could not resist it, because of the way in which the noble Lord raised the matter.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07072327000013"></a>However, the noble Lord made the fair point about the money flow. When the money flows into Northern Ireland from Irish recipients, it stays there. Therefore, for example, the Conservative Party of Northern Ireland, on a separate register, cannot donate to the Conservative Party of Great Britain&#151;likewise the Labour Party and other parties. The money stays there. As a UK citizen on the electoral register, I can donate to parties in Northern Ireland. People in England, Scotland and Wales can donate to political parties in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70723-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07072327000014"></a>The question that arises is whether people resident in Northern Ireland can donate to political parties in the Republic, which is in effect a foreign country. It is not my job to answer that, because it is a matter exclusively for the Republic of Ireland&#146;s own legislative effect. I understand that such parties could donate to Irish parties if they had an office on the island of Ireland from which one or more of their principal activities are directed. I remember making this point when we discussed the Bill. But that is a matter for Irish legislation, as the regulation of donations to parties in the UK, including Northern Ireland, is a matter for UK legislation. We have discussed that with Ireland&#151;I made that clear in my opening speech&#151;but we differ in aspects of the proposed law. I fully accept that.</p>

If the Conservative Party in London decided to have all its election posters done, with the printing and material, under the auspices of the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, for example, or somewhere in Northern Ireland, and those accounts were paid by the resident Conservatives, where would we be then?</p>

However, as far as I know we are a United Kingdom and any business anywhere in the United Kingdom can do business with other areas. That is a business transaction. This is part of electoral law, but there should be a satisfactory answer that does not stop political parties organising themselves. That is not the intention. The intention is to stop money-laundering via the Irish route to Northern Ireland and to GB parties, because we do not accept donations from foreigners or foreign countries in Great Britain&#151;and that legally would be the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07072327000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith, asked about the words &#147;eligible to obtain&#148;, which is clearly a legitimate question. The order is drafted to take account of the legal concept of Irish citizenship. Not to put too fine a point on it, it was not thought appropriate for us to legislate in the UK to dictate what status someone in Ireland should have. That is why the route is the other way.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07072327000018"></a>I shall explain how the checks will be done, because that will explain the position. What safeguards or checks will there be on Irish donors being entitled to donate to Northern Ireland parties? All citizens permitted under Irish law to donate to political parties in Ireland will have to meet the prescribed condition to be eligible to donate. That is, they must be eligible to obtain at the time of making the donation one of the three following documents indicative of citizenship: an Irish passport, a certificate of nationality or a certificate of naturalisation. It is not appropriate for us in the UK to legislate to dictate which one of those documents people should have or whether they should have it; all that we have laid down is that they should be eligible to obtain such a document.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07072327000019"></a>A certified copy of those documents must accompany the report in which the Northern Ireland recipient reports the relevant donation. In other words, the political party that reports the donation to the Electoral Commission must have a document stating that the donor was eligible to obtain a certificate of nationality, a certificate of naturalisation or an Irish passport at the time they made the donation. That would satisfy the rules; it would ensure that one has closed the groups of people who would be eligible for that. Those documents&#151;the Irish passport, a certificate of nationality or a certificate of naturalisation&#151;would be certified by Ireland&#146;s Department of Foreign Affairs. That closes down the people who are not Irish citizens, or those eligible to be Irish citizens, in Timbuktu or anywhere else being able to shove money into Northern Ireland parties. The effect is the same as if we had legislated, which would have been considered improper, to say that they must hold one of those documents. That was agreed between the two Governments.</p>

I understand the point about people having a passport, a naturalisation certificate or a nationality certificate, but these days it is so easy to forge passports that I wonder how much easier it is to forge a statement of eligibility that one is entitled to one of these documents. I find that so loose and open-ended that, even given the Minister&#146;s best efforts at an explanation, I do not believe that he has answered my point.</p>

<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="07072327000021"></a><b><a name="70723-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07072327000031"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, that document will be certified as genuine by Ireland's Government; for example, by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin. I am not arguing about what is easy to forge and what is not easy to forge, but the Electoral Commission would receive details of the donation from the recipient in Northern Ireland&#151;the political party&#151;accompanied by a certified document from the Department of Foreign Affairs that the donor was eligible to make the donation. In other words, they have to be eligible to make the donation in Ireland anyway, as that is where the constraint  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_636"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 636</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>comes in. People who are not eligible to donate in Ireland are not eligible to donate in Northern Ireland. It is said that the check will be carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am happy to put that in a more detailed note.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07072327000022"></a>It is worth putting this next paragraph on the record. The Northern Ireland recipients&#151;that is, the parties&#151;will have to provide the information set out in new paragraph 2A of Schedule 6 to the 2000 Act in donation reports from Irish bodies. In practice, in order to accept the donation and to provide the information required in new paragraph 2A, the Northern Ireland recipient will need to be satisfied that the body has an office in Ireland or in Northern Ireland from which one or more of its principal activities are directed and that the body falls in one of the categories prescribed in Article 4.2. That will enable the Electoral Commission to check both individuals and companies&#151;it obviously deals with donations from registered companies. In other words, the donor has to be legitimate; it cannot be a front company. The company must have the wherewithal and the legal authority to donate in Ireland in the first place.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07072327000023"></a>People may argue about this, but this is a constraint on what happens today. I repeat that today political parties in Northern Ireland can receive money from any individual of any nationality, from any company, anywhere in the world without having to make a report to anyone about the amount of money received. Therefore, there is progress on that. This is not completely aligned with the United Kingdom, for reasons that I have explained, which we shall have to live with. I fully accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bew, in his maiden speech that, come the next general election, people will be able to question legitimately from where the parties have got the money. There will be certain constraints about not being identified, but they will be free to make voluntary submissions about where the money came from. The fact is that there will be challenges about the money, which is quite legitimate in a democracy. We have set up a legal framework and we want it to operate fairly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07072330000004"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the order was debated in another place on Monday 2 July. The House will recall that during the passage of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003 the Government made a commitment that, in view of the importance of the issue, this commencement order would be given full consideration by both Houses at the appropriate time. This approach reflected the importance of the provisions and that the timing of their commencement needed to be right. The context for tonight&#146;s debate is, of course, very different from that which existed at the time of the original legislation. I rely on that from the positive comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Paisley.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07072330000005"></a>Following the historic agreement to policing and the rule of law made by Sinn Fein earlier this year, there is now a firm foundation for stable devolved government and a new era for politics in Northern Ireland. We are confident that the Assembly will sustain the commitment it has already shown and continue to move Northern Ireland forward towards a shared future.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07072330000006"></a>There are, of course, many challenges ahead, not least the need to reach a decision on the devolution of policing and justice. We are pleased that the Northern Ireland Assembly has already established a committee to consider this issue, due to report by 27 March 2008. Work is now under way in the Northern Ireland Office to ensure that the policing and justice functions can be devolved by May 2008 should the Assembly request it.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07072330000007"></a>The progress on support for policing has been quite remarkable. Sinn Fein members having now taken their place on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, the prospect of inclusive policing supported by the entire community is at last a reality.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07072330000008"></a>A key element in the accountability architecture is the network of district policing partnerships throughout Northern Ireland. Since their establishment, they have played a unique role in building safer communities and empowering them to help shape local policing. The district policing partnerships have faced many challenges and I am sure that noble Lords will join me this evening in paying tribute to their work and the courage that many of them have shown in the face of threats and intimidation. District policing partnerships have made a positive impact on policing and, we hope, will continue to do so&#151;a view shared by the policing Oversight Commissioner and others&#151;but we need to build on this success, which is why we have decided to bring forward this commencement order.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07072330000009"></a>The Patten report recommended that both independent and elected members of the Policing Board and district policing partnerships should play a part in making the police accountable. The provisions we are now considering had their origins in the revised implementation plan of 2001, which the Government undertook to consider whether, in the context of a review of policing arrangements, the existing provisions in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 remained appropriate. The outcome of that review was published in the form of a draft Bill on 25 November 2002, together with &#147;text for consideration&#148; setting out how the Government intended to legislate in respect of district policing partnership disqualification and the powers of the Belfast district policing partnership subgroups. Draft clauses were subsequently introduced on Report of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07072330000010"></a>I have already indicated that we made clear that the commencement of these provisions would be by means of an order subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses. The Government believe that the time is right to commence these legislative provisions concerning district policing partnerships and the related district policing partnership provisions in the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006. Our intention is that all these related provisions come into force on 4 September this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07072330000011"></a>The legislation before us this evening deals with matters relating to district policing partnerships and, in particular, arrangements for independent members&#146; declarations against terrorism and disqualification. It also provides for the functions of the Belfast subgroups. The order inserts a range of provisions into the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 and is, by its nature, complex. I will briefly deal with the main issues.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07072330000012"></a>Article 2 brings into force Section 15(1) to (5), Section 16(1) and Section 19(1) of and Schedule 1 to the 2003 Act. Section 15 brings the arrangements for independent members into line with those for political members. It requires them to make a declaration against terrorism in the same terms as prospective councillors before their application can be considered by the Policing Board. If an independent member appears to have acted in breach of his or her declaration against terrorism, it will be within the power of the Policing Board, or the district council with the approval of the Policing Board, to remove that person from membership of the district policing partnership.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07072330000013"></a>Section 16 amends the disqualification provision set out in paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 to the 2000 Act. The legislation provides that no one who has ever received a custodial sentence&#151;regardless of how long ago or for what offence&#151;should be allowed to serve as an independent member of the district policing partnerships. The section changes that and provides that a period of five years must elapse following a person&#146;s discharge in respect of an offence before he or she may be considered for appointment to a district policing partnership. This provision is not new and brings the arrangements for independent members into line with the arrangements for political members of district policing partnerships, who are drawn from the local council. Similar arrangements apply in relation to appointments to police authorities in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07072330000014"></a>Section 19 and Schedule 1 deal with the arrangements within Belfast for the subgroups of district policing partnerships. Existing Section 21 of the 2000 Act requires Belfast City Council to establish a subgroup of its district policing partnership for each of the police districts within Belfast.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07072330000015"></a>The functions now proposed for the new subgroups mirror those for district policing partnerships in the 2000 Act. The Government believe that this should help strengthen the relationship between the local community and the police service of its area within Belfast. Article 3 provides for the commencement of Schedule 9 to the St Andrews agreement Act of 2006, which updates the provisions relating to the Belfast subgroups and takes account of the changes made to district policing partnership arrangements brought about by the District Policing Partnerships (Northern Ireland) Order 2005, which, as noble Lords will recall, made provision for the membership of district policing partnerships in the period immediately following a local government election. It also amended the law on the removal of members following conviction for a criminal offence and made a new provision about the chairmen and vice-chairmen of district policing  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_639"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 639</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>partnerships. The commencement of these amendments is, therefore, linked to the commencement of the Belfast provisions in the 2003 Act.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07072330000016"></a>I have already indicated to the House that other district policing partnership provisions in the St Andrews agreement Act will commence at the same time as these provisions, but they do not require an affirmative resolution, although they play a key role and go hand in hand with this order. Schedule 8 to the St Andrews agreement Act provides for the reconstitution of district policing partnerships before the next local government election. This will enable members of Sinn Fein to take their political seats on district policing partnerships and allow the policing board to run recruitment exercises for independent members for the district policing partnerships affected.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07072330000017"></a>The board is to review the membership of each district policing partnership, and this must be completed within 15 days. District councils have three months following this review to appoint new political members of the district policing partnerships affected by the review. In line with the consideration and, I hope, approval of the order, the Government intend that Schedule 8 to the St Andrews agreement Act 2006 comes into force on 4 September. Commencing these provisions on this date provides the optimum timeframe for the reconstitution of district policing partnerships. From 4 September, the order will apply each time that the membership of a district policing partnership changes after a local government election. It will also apply to the one-off reconstitution of district policing partnerships under Schedule 8 to the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07072330000018"></a>We are well aware that this legislation has a direct impact on district policing partnerships and, in particular, on their members. I think that all of us in this House greatly appreciate the important role that the partnerships have played since their establishment and the undoubted commitment and courage shown by their members. However, the commitment of all parties and all communities to support policing and the rule of law now provides an opportunity to ensure that district policing partnerships fully reflect the communities they serve&#151;and we should not miss that opportunity. That is why we think that now is the right time to bring forward these provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07072330000019"></a>I apologise for the length and detail of my speech, but it is important to get some of this on the record. I commend the draft order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

He is absolutely right&#151;it is all very important material to be debated, but, once again, we find ourselves in the Northern Ireland trap. I know that he agrees with me that this is a serious piece of legislation, it should be passed as a Bill, we should have plenty of time to debate it, turn it about, look around it, and so on. Once again, we are forced into a dinner-hour debate, we are running out of time and there is no real means by which we can debate this order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07072330000022"></a>Having said that, I will not take up much more of your Lordships&#146; time. I want to be associated with the Minister&#146;s tribute to the DPPs and those who have served on them. I have made that tribute before. They have done a great job. The DPPs, by and large, have worked very well and a large number of their members have had their lives at risk and been threatened but have stood it and stayed with it, so many thanks and congratulations to them.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07072330000023"></a>A lot of this order, despite what I have just said, was debated at some length when we were passing the 2003 Act, but I would like to ask the Minister one or two questions. The first is on custodial sentences&#151;five years is not really debatable now. As for all the people let out by Mo Mowlam, that was a long time ago and the five years have long passed. But there is one group of people to consider. I understood that a life sentence is always a life sentence and that life sentences are not commuted and never discharged, even under the two Irish agreements&#151;the St Andrews and the Belfast agreements. I would like the Minister to tell me that those who have been convicted of life sentences would not be eligible to serve on DPPs.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07072330000024"></a>Secondly, and on a different line, I am concerned to some extent about the subgroups in Belfast. We were going to have four districts in Belfast and four subgroups. I am slightly confused, because the latest I heard was that there were only going to be two districts in Belfast and I assume that they are only going to have two subgroups. I wonder whether, if we are only having two districts, two subgroups is the right number. Maybe we do not need any subgroups; maybe we should still have four subgroups, working to enlarge the districts. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07072330000025"></a>I read a lot of the briefings on this order a week or so ago, and by and large we have no problem going along with it. We believe that policing is progressing. We are thankful for the way it is going. We keep our fingers crossed every day that nothing awful will happen.

I, too, pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery and fortitude that members of those partnerships have shown throughout very difficult, stressful and often dangerous times.

It is the same for those in elected positions in Northern Ireland who have tried to keep normal life going in the last 30 years. For colleagues on the mainland, there is no comparison with what these people have put up with in terms of trying to maintain a semblance of a democratic, civic society&#151;an injured one, it is true, but less fractured now than it has been for many a time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07072330000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, chided me because we had made legislative commitments. I was grateful to be reminded that this is not the legislation for that change; it is purely a commencement order. The debates on the issues took place long before I had any responsibility for Northern Ireland. I apologise to the extent that we have gone over the time for the dinner break. I say &#147;purely a commencement order&#148; but without it we cannot proceed.</p>

<a name="70723-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07072330000030"></a>There is an issue involving Belfast. I understand that the district policing partnerships must mirror the local government and policing operational boundaries. It is up to the Chief Constable to decide how he organises policing in Northern Ireland; it is not up to Ministers. I understand that he has decided to have two DPPs in Belfast. The order allows for up to four. I assume that that will mirror the policing arrangements but that is an operational matter for the Chief Constable and I think that that will be discussed. All we have done is produce enabling legislation to fit the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07072330000031"></a>The other issue is much more sensitive. The condition is that a person must be out of prison for more than five years. Those with a life sentence can be out on licence. However, if they were out of prison for five years they would be covered in exactly the same way as political members. What has more or less been brought in for independent members is that which applies to the political members&#151;the declaration against terrorism, which has to be made by councillors; it is also taken by members of district policing partnerships, who use wording that is virtually the same&#151;it was taken from the same legislation. Ministers also have to make a statement. Only MLAs do not have to make such a statement. The point is being out of prison for more than five years, irrespective of the offence or length of sentence. That covers the circumstances that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked me about.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07072330000037"></a>The noble Earl said: The purpose of this amendment is very simple. It would obviate the difficulty of having, as a host organisation, a person or body directly concerned with providing local care services. Why should that situation pose a difficulty? The difficulty, of course, is that it would present a financial conflict of interest. One activity performed by a LINk will be to contribute to commissioning decisions about local care services. Another activity will be to scrutinise those services. If a host is an entity that is being scrutinised, if it is a provider of services that the LINk wishes to criticise publicly or if it is an organisation that is competing to provide care services that the LINk is assessing, it would be impossible for that entity to provide impartial support to the LINk. The conflict of interest at the very least puts the host in a difficult position. The host might, for example, wish to influence a commissioning decision in its own favour, or provide critical reports on a rival service provider, but would be constrained from doing so by virtue of its role as a host. Similarly, the host, as the secretariat for a LINk, could find itself accidentally in possession of information that might be commercially sensitive and directly useful to it; for example, information relating to a rival service provider. It surely cannot be appropriate for that situation to arise.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07072330000038"></a>The Minister may well talk to us about Chinese walls being created within a host organisation. I want to hear more about what these walls would look like before being reassured that there might be ways around the problems I have just outlined. I am concerned that unless the issue is addressed we are storing up problems for both LINks and host organisations, which would be unfair for them. This amendment provides a simple way forward.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07072330000039"></a>In this group I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 238VA, 238VCA and 238ZZAA. Clauses 224 and 225 cover the duties of service providers to respond to and allow entry to local involvement networks. When we look at who falls within the definition of service provider, the list is surprisingly short. Why is that? Why does it not include, for example, independent treatment centres where NHS patients are treated? Why should it not include a private care home where individuals are being looked after at the expense of a local authority? There is a provision in each of the clauses to make regulations. Can the Minister say whether regulations will bring such service providers within the scope of these statutory duties?</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07072330000040"></a>Naturally, this is a probing amendment. I fully appreciate that care homes present particular sensitivities. I am not suggesting that all parts of a care home should be open to members of a LINk to enter as a right. The privacy of residents must be respected. I would be glad if the Minister could tell us what exactly the intention is as regards care homes in the context of the duties contained in these two clauses. In particular, what would be the role and remit of a LINk outside the boundaries of its own local authority, when services had been commissioned out-of-area?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="07072330000041"></a>Amendment No. 238VCA contains an unfortunate double misprint. I speak to the amendment only in passing because the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, will be covering the matter of commissioning in a substantive way. For the benefit of the Committee, the word &#147;proscribed&#148; should be &#147;prescribed&#148; and the phrase &#147;by regulations&#148; should read &#147;in regulations.&#148; The amendment, if taken with Amendment No. 238SB, is otherwise self-explanatory. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07072330000042"></a><b><a name="70723-0015.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07072330000066"></a>Baroness Neuberger:</b> I support everything that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has said. I shall add a few words on Amendment No. 238SB. This deals with the matter of commissioners, to which the noble Earl referred. The reason for this amendment is that we are, as the Minister has already said, in a fast-moving scenario in terms of health service structures. This legislation is all about service providers, but commissioners make many of the decisions. Some would say that they make all the decisions. Commissioners are, themselves, changing. We will, after all, see more GP-practice-based commissioning, where GPs are also providers. PCTs commission, but are also providers. Commissioners commission from independent treatment centres and voluntary sector organisations, which often fail to respond. Unless commissioners also have a duty to respond to the LINks&#146; concerns, this system may well be full of holes and somewhat inadequate.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07072330000043"></a>This is a probing amendment to find out what the Minister thinks will be the case with commissioners. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us that this was simply some kind of oversight.</p>

<ul><a name="07072330000057"></a>&#147;a person or body providing services to or on behalf of the National Health Service or of a local authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072330000055"></a>It is an attempt to gain a clearer vision of who is involved. In Amendment No. 238Z, we seek to leave out paragraph (e), which seems to give rather too much leeway to the Secretary of State by covering everything. If the Secretary of State fails to name all the service providers, he has a fall-back position. That seems a little over-heavy and I question whether it is really necessary. If it is, it tends to indicate that the issue may not have been thought through quite as fully as it should have been. I have also added my name to many of the other amendments in this group.</p>

We have talked about the importance of the role of the host. It establishes the independence of a LINk and is vital in providing support, advice and experience according to local circumstances. I can see that there is a tension, but we think that it can be resolved and I hope to explain how. We certainly want organisations that are critically well versed in matters relating to health and social care to have the opportunity to bid for the job as a host. That is only common sense.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="07072330000046"></a>I understand noble Lords&#146; anxieties about conflicts of interest. However, it will be commonplace for the organisations that are most likely to want to pitch for

For example, Age Concern may provide bathing services under a contract with a local authority and, at the same time, it may have a contract to provide host support to a LINk. Age Concern currently provides support to PPI forums without its interests causing difficulties. We know that the current providers of support to PPI forums&#151;the not-for-profit support organisations which have tremendous knowledge and experience&#151;would be interested in acting as hosts. They have certainly been very interested in the story so far. However, so important do we consider this issue to be that the model contract deals with it explicitly. Indeed, the model tender requirements set out that the host will need to demonstrate that it can identify and manage any conflict of interest in delivering the contract, stating any interest that it has, and a protocol is in place to address those interests.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07072330000047"></a>Amendment No. 238M seeks to include providers of local care services under the list of organisations that should not be eligible. I hope that I have explained not only why we think that they should be eligible but why they would be well placed to provide the service. Crucially, the local authority will have to take an objective and robust view as to which organisation is best able to deliver the support. We know that some organisations will wish to provide support to LINks and they may also be involved in the delivery of health and care services. We believe not that they are unsuitable but that they may be very suitable indeed. However, local authorities will have to be transparent and clear. When they discuss the relative merits of these bodies, they will have to show that they best fit the criteria. They will performance-manage the delivery. As we discussed earlier, if they fail to satisfy the contract requirements, ultimately the contract can be terminated.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07072330000048"></a>There are safeguards in the process, not least because the overview and scrutiny committee is well placed to review the hosting arrangements, and the LINk will form part of the performance-management of the host. I believe that the safeguards that are built in are pretty robust. We have advice available to ensure that all organisations have a structure in place to guarantee openness and transparency. Agencies such as the NHS Centre for Involvement, the Centre for Public Scrutiny and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations can all be involved in helping to determine what will go into making an independent organisation with knowledge, sensitivity and understanding of the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07072330000049"></a>Amendment No. 238V and the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, Amendments Nos. 238Y and 238Z, all address the need to expand the scope and reach of LINks to ensure that all who should be monitored by a LINk can be. They seek to change the definition of &#147;services-provider&#148; to include any provider of a publicly funded service. Noble Lords asked where an organisation such as a private care home fits in? These amendments would mean that independent third sector providers would be named in the Bill as bodies that have to both respond to LINks reports and recommendations and allow LINks representatives to enter and view. That is important, because LINks powers ought to be able to cut across  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_645"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 645</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the whole field, but while we agree with the principle we feel that is important to provide for it in ways that are sensitive to differences in the nature of organisations.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07072330000050"></a>We are clear that independent providers should provide access and information just as public sector bodies do, but it is not our intention to place such legislative duties on the independent sector. That is not appropriate. However, we will ensure that independent providers in either health or social care comply with LINks powers by ensuring that the commissioners of services include that requirement in their contracts through directions made by the Secretary of State for Health. So, there will be accountability and responsibility in line with wider government policy not to place further statutory burdens on the independent sector&#151;as was also the case with the current patients&#146; forums.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="07072330000051"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 238VA and 238ZZAA, which also seek to change the definition of &#147;services-provider&#148; to include the independent sector and all services commissioned within the local authority&#146;s area, even if they are provided outside the area. I can reassure the Committee that the amendments are not necessary as the activities of a LINk relate to local care services in a local authority&#146;s area. Clause 222(5) covers care services provided in the authority&#146;s area and those provided, in any place, for people from the area. So, services commissioned within the local authority&#146;s area will include those that people received outside the area where they live.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="07072330000052"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendments Nos. 238SB and 238VCA, on which the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, particularly spoke. The definition of &#147;services-provider&#148; is given in Clause 224(2), and it includes both commissioners and providers of health and social care, which should take care of the noble Baroness&#146;s anxiety on that point.</p>

Its only disappointing aspect was that she was a little cursory in referring to the protocols that would be set up to avoid the impact of conflicts of interest where they arise. I am sure that we have sufficient time to examine the draft documents that the noble Baroness has circulated; I shall try to give them more justice than I have been able to so far. Yet these are potentially important issues, and we do not want to walk into a situation where they arise frequently. One can imagine that they might, if the host organisation was of a certain kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="07072330000054"></a>I was grateful to hear the Minister talk about the contractual obligations to be imposed on independent sector providers, which would indirectly ensure that they were exposed to the light of day as regards the powers of LINks to enter and view those sorts of premises; that clarification was helpful.</p>

In relation to the Bill, local involvement networks are rather like ghosts at the feast; they are invisible and barely defined in any material sense. The Government's argument, which I do not in anyway dismiss because I believe it has something genuine going for it, is that Ministers want to leave it up to LINks to decide how best to set themselves up and they do not want to be prescriptive in legislation about matters of this nature.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07072337000008"></a>In another place there was a fair bit of debate about amendments designed to introduce an element of prescriptiveness on what a LINk should be and how it should be constituted. Apart from the fact that such amendments are most unlikely to commend themselves to the Minister, I was personally not convinced that this approach was the right one. I have therefore not tabled an amendment of quite that sort. Nevertheless, I remain troubled that what we are contemplating doing through the Bill is to allow structures and organisations to be set up with absolutely no means of guaranteeing that they are fit and proper bodies to be in receipt of public money. Indeed, we have no idea at all about the kinds of organisation to which the money will be going. If the legislation leaves it totally open as to what a LINk can be and how it can behave in terms of its internal operations, then I suggest we are not being responsible as legislators for the way in which the public purse is to be dispensed. There really must be a minimum set of conditions laid down before that can happen.</p>

Of course we trust that that will be the case, but is it enough for us to leave it entirely to host organisations to sort all this out? Do we not have a responsibility to say to those host organisations, &#147;You can work within your own parameters, but there are two or three things on which you must satisfy yourselves absolutely before parting with any public money, and on which you cannot compromise&#148;?</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="07072337000010"></a>A LINk has to have some recognised system of governance to receive public money. I am not saying what that system should be. There are several possible options. But there have to be appointed or elected officers and a constitution that makes it clear what the rules of the LINk are. We cannot do without those things. Somebody or some identifiable group of people has to be accountable for what the LINk does in terms of its public activities, as well as how it operates internally. I suggest that the Secretary of State should make regulations which specify simply that without being any more prescriptive or detailed. I also suggest that although it is not the business of the Secretary of State to dictate who should or should not be a member of a LINk, we have to recognise that for any organisation in receipt of public funds, considerations of propriety do matter in the way it operates internally. In particular, for an area such as this, there have to be clear ways of dealing with conflicts of interests. If literally anyone at all can be a member of a LINk it is obvious that conflicts of this kind are going to arise. They need to be dealt with in some way that is satisfactory. In other words, a LINk should not be allowed to let this issue go by default. If it does, it will fail to do those things for which it was set up, which are to represent the views of patients and the public in a fair and unbiased manner.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="07072337000011"></a>I need take only one example to illustrate the importance of what I am talking about. Under the Bill it is perfectly possible for a provider of local care services to be a member of a LINk. If an organisation such as BUPA, for example, whose staff are &#147;people&#148; under the Bill, were to be a member of a LINk at a time when it was bidding to provide health services or had already secured a contract to do so, there would need to be procedures to recognise and deal with that conflict of interest in order that the LINk&#146;s activities in relation to the bid or the contact were fair and seen to be fair. There is no single way of achieving this, although one excellent way has been suggested to me, about which I can tell the Minister later if she is interested. The point here is that conflicts of interest, whatever form they take, will inhibit arms-length, unbiased input from LINks. That has to be avoided.</p>

<a name="70723-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07072337000012"></a>This amendment is minimalist. It would bind the Secretary of State only in the sense that he would be obliged to make regulations which addressed the issues of governance and conflicts of interest without being prescriptive in either case and which made such minimum stipulations about those matters in relation to LINks as he saw fit. I beg to move.</p>

We want this to be in the Bill so that if this direction is not obeyed the local authority will be committing an offence and can be called to account for it. I do not need to say much more.

Following what the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Rea, have already said, there are concerns around the Chamber about conflicts of interest and how these relationships are going to work. We have tabled an amendment which suggests that a link could have the power to direct the actions of the host in pursuance of some of the arrangements. The reason for this relates to what the Minister said earlier on, which is that the host is a servant of the LINk. How does the LINk have power over an unco-operative host? The unco-operative host may have a conflict of interest because it is already a provider of services. Does the LINk have the capacity to &#147;fire&#148; the host? This point was made very powerfully to me by Robin Tuck, the chairman of Kensington and Chelsea patients&#146; forum. His view is very clear. He says that in the proper discharge of its duties, for instance, a LINk needs to commission research about what is happening on its patch. It will have to do that if it is going to make sense of what is going on. How can it do that if it does not hold the budget? The host holds the budget, but what if the host does not agree with the LINk about the need for such research, at least in part because the host is a provider of services and does not want them looked at too closely? Surely the LINk must have the power to compel the host to fund research or whatever else is required. In other words, it must be the LINk that has the power in this relationship rather than the host if the LINk is to be effective. It would be good to be given some clarification on this issue.</p>

I am departing from my note here and I hope that my officials do not fall out of the Box in horror. I shall try to follow it as much as is appropriate. These are important amendments, but I think that reluctantly the noble Earl and I shall have to disagree about them. He is wrestling powerfully with the notion of a wraithlike creature here, but I know that as we go through the amendments, things will become clearer. I can see the thinking behind the noble Earl&#146;s amendment in the context of governance and conflicts of interest, but the problem lies in the notion of imposing a structure on the LINk. No matter how tempting it is to lay down a set of critical elements of what should be in place, we remain sure that it is not appropriate in the context of what we are trying to create. It should not be for the Government or Parliament to take the responsibilities away in this area, or for any body other than a LINk to determine its governance arrangements.</p>

The problem is that once we start prescribing governance models, we will get into the sort of detail from which it would be difficult to move. It would resemble the problems we had with the patients&#146; forums when their functions were set out in the detail of the legislation. Every LINk will need to address different factors depending on geography, demography and local healthcare arrangements. Given that, I am afraid that regulations could hinder these processes rather than help them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="07072337000017"></a>I know that this response will be disappointing to the noble Earl, so I should make it clear that I accept that the LINks will need support and guidance to enable them to come to decisions about issues such as governance and conflicts of interest. It is certainly our intention to make those resources available and to help them all we can. The nature of the negotiations that will go into settling the contract to agree the governance arrangements for LINks will have to ensure that no one single organisation can dominate. That will be part of the challenge of management, and it will be a challenge because the membership of the LINks will be wide-ranging. On the other hand, there is a strength in that. LINks will be able to accommodate special interests more readily than a patients&#146; forum, which had a much more limited membership. Further, it is true of any statutory institution that it has to be able to manage potential conflicts of interest by ensuring that interests are recorded in accordance with standards in public life as made clear in the Nolan principles. We will provide examples of best practice to support the LINks in that context.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="07072337000018"></a>I know that my noble friend anticipated my response, and it is true that Amendment No. 238Q is not required. The local authority has no power to influence the activities of a host or a LINk other than through the terms of the contract. We will set out in guidance what is an appropriate role for the local authority and host, but the guidance will certainly not dictate governance arrangements, terms of reference, ways of working, priorities or programmes. The notion of independence will be very substantial and not at all wraithlike. It will be clear that the local authority cannot influence the arrangements, and the host organisation will be accountable to the local authority in terms of performance management as its contract manager for the support costs. The LINk will be accountable to the public to demonstrate the effective spend of its budget, for example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="07072337000019"></a>On Amendment No. 238S, I note with interest the desire of the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, to put into the statute that:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07072337000059"></a>The first point to make clear is that the arrangements are of a contractual nature and will be made between the local authority and the host. Our expectation is that there will be dual accountability. It is interesting to consider the medical analogy here. The host can reject a parasite, and there is something of a duality here. On the one hand the host will be accountable to the local authority in terms of the delivery of the

The principal point I was trying to make is that each LINk has to have some form of governance if it is to have a voice that can be ascribed to it; otherwise what is to distinguish a LINk from simply an informal and disparate group of people who happen to be in communication with each other? Even co-operatives have to have some form of governance. We cannot have a body with no governance at all; we cannot have an organisation with no formalities associated with it. This is the point I was driving at. We cannot channel public money into an area that literally has no basis for being an entity of any kind. I am troubled that we are trying to be so flexible with the Bill that we may end up being less scrupulous than we should be on the use of public funds.</p>

It seeks to test out whether some LINks can make collaborative arrangements with other LINks; whether they can use the money that they get from the hosts for this purpose in order, perhaps, to form themselves into a representative body, either regional or national; and whether the hosts can stop them doing that&#151;in other words, whether there are no limits on what they may do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="07072337000029"></a>If they are going to do that, there will need to be some basic principles. The Involvement Network suggests that these should apply to LINks, hosts, local authorities and NHS health and social care commissioners and providers, and that the principles should include being committed to working positively with other LINks and other bodies of whatever nature involved in commissioning, supporting or otherwise improving the health and well-being of local communities and communities of interest. It suggests that that will need some kind of national network.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="07072337000030"></a>Ministers have suggested that the proposed National Voices project or the already existing NHS Centre for Involvement could replace some of the functions that the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health now serves or that some kind of joint body of LINks could create. However, it is rather difficult to see how either the new National Voices project or the NHS Centre for Involvement could play the same kind of direct part in protecting the independence of LINks in the same way that LINks banding together could do. One of the reasons for that is that neither is set up or funded to fulfil that function, or was expected to have the same direct connection with LINks as the commission has at the moment with patient forums. National Voices is still some way from being established, while the national centre is a Department of Health contractor and so, you could argue, not appropriate to be a national independent body for LINks.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="07072337000031"></a>If there is to be a system with LINks, there remains a clear need for an independent national body to promote patient involvement as well as promoting some of the broader issues around health and social care on behalf of all the people involved in that world. LINks need to be allowed to work together and to use the money they get from hosts to do so. It may be an extension of the present National Association of Patient Forums or it may be some other model that might suffice, but we need to be clear that there is nothing to stop them doing that or using money from hosts to do it. I beg to move.</p>

The reason I am worried about this is the wording of Clause 222. When a host organisation makes arrangements to deliver the activities listed in that clause in a local area, it will be obliged to look at what the clause says. It refers to activities that are wholly and exclusively focused on local care services. A national or regional umbrella organisation for LINks would inevitably have a wider purview than the local area of an individual LINk. The benefit of such a body would, as we have heard, enable LINks to share ideas and best practice, provide information, co-ordinate efforts and generally promote good communication between members.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="07072337000033"></a>LINKs are almost certain to want a national voice. For example, there may well be occasions when a national survey on some particular aspect of healthcare is called for. To the extent that an individual LINk contributes to that activity by means of a financial subscription, it will not be directing its budget to those activities prescribed for it in Clause 222. How should a

The Minister may give perfectly sincere assurances on this, but against a literal interpretation of the clause, the host organisation might well find itself in some difficulty. There should be an explicit mandate in the Bill to create a national representative body&#151;not necessarily in terms of this precise amendment, but something along those lines&#151;because otherwise my fear is that someone will come along and accuse local involvement networks, and possibly also their hosts, of acting ultra vires.

This is an important idea. There has been a lot of criticism recently that the third&#151;that is, voluntary&#151;sector has become almost too much part of state activity, and therefore its ability to be creative and think ahead of time about what will need attention will be stifled. It is indeed the voluntary sector that gets busy in those areas first.

<p><a name="07072337000060"></a>However, when we read on we find that this is not quite what the clause says. In delineating the regulations which the Secretary of State may make, it refers first to services providers responding to requests for information from a LINk. That is fine. But then, in relation to reports or recommendations made by a LINk or by another services provider, the words &#147;responding to&#148; are replaced by &#147;dealing with&#148;. What is the significance of that? I can &#147;deal with&#148; a report or recommendation by ignoring it altogether and putting it in the wastepaper basket. I can &#147;deal with&#148; it by reading it, disagreeing with it and taking no further action. In other words, I can deal with it without having to account to anyone else about what I have done and why. I am not sure that it is appropriate or in the spirit of the clause to have the words &#147;dealing with&#148; in this context, which is why I suggest that the words &#147;responding to&#148; might be better. It will be helpful to hear what the Government have in mind to put in regulations here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="07072337000047"></a>On Amendment No. 238UA, we come back to the issue of outcomes as opposed to mere processes. Services providers are to have duties conferred on them to respond to requests for information and to deal with reports and recommendations; but nowhere here is there any sense that they are supposed to take action to improve services where there is a clear case for doing so. Not all reports or recommendations from a LINk will be persuasive but when they are, someone ought to be concerned with taking the recommendations forward, otherwise the whole exercise might just as well not have been started. I should be glad if the Minister could reassure me on this point. I beg to move.</p>

If we unpick them, noble Lords will see that the change is unnecessary as well as undesirable. However, the noble Earl has done an excellent job in pointing out the difference between &#147;dealing with&#148; and &#147;responding to&#148;, but the merit in this case lies in &#147;dealing with&#148; for almost exactly the reasons that he put forward.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="07072337000049"></a>I know that he thinks that &#147;dealing with&#148; has a negative connotation, suggesting that a service provider would not have to provide LINks with a proper response. However, that is not the case, because &#147;dealing with&#148; covers everything that could be put in regulations on responding to a report. It allows also for regulations to state what a services provider should do if it received a report or recommendation, but was not the body that was required to respond to it.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="07072337000050"></a>Commissioners of services should respond to reports and recommendations as they are ultimately responsible for the services that are provided within an area. They are certainly best placed to deal with a strategic report. If the report were to be sent to the provider, the regulations could place a duty on that service provider to forward it to the relevant body that commissioned the services.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="07072337000051"></a>The use of the phrase &#147;dealing with&#148; is deliberate, because it gives a wider power than &#147;responding to&#148;. It allows for services providers to pass reports to the relevant body with a duty to respond. It therefore gives more purchase on the system than does merely &#147;responding to&#148;. I hope that the noble Earl will accept that.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="07072337000052"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 238UA and the proposal to take a power to allow regulations to impose a duty on a body receiving recommendations from a LINk to demonstrate that, where relevant, it has acted to improve services in response. I completely agree that a PCT or local authority receiving a report from a LINk should be required to take some action and certainly should respond to the LINk. We intend that a local authority or PCT be obliged to acknowledge receipt of a report or recommendation, and supply an explanation of the action that it intends to take or why it does not intend to take any action.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="07072337000053"></a>Those bodies receiving reports and recommendations will need to take account of many factors when considering a LINk&#146;s ideas&#151;many of them may not be known to the LINk. Not every LINk recommendation if followed would necessarily lead to improvements in services, and the bodies responsible for the services would need to take a view on whether the advice was followed.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="07072337000054"></a>I hope that the noble Earl, bearing in mind that slight complication within the actions, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="07072349000003"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 238VE and 238W. Clause 225 deals with the duties placed on services providers to allow authorised representatives of local involvement networks to enter and view their premises and to observe the activities taking place within those premises. I think that we need to understand a little more closely from the Minister what this duty will amount to in practice.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="07072349000004"></a>First, on the word &#147;view&#148;, those who used to be members of community health councils and those who are currently members of patient forums will tell you that one of the essential features of their functions and powers was the right not only to enter premises but to carry out detailed inspections, part of which could well involve talking to service users and staff. The ability to talk to users and staff is absolutely vital, because without that it is well nigh impossible to gauge the quality of the service being provided. When negligent care is discovered by PPI forums, it is usually as a consequence of disclosure by a patient or a member of staff to a forum member.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="07072349000005"></a>If I have a concern about the word &#147;view&#148;, it is that it suggests something rather more remote and passive than the word &#147;inspect&#148;. If an estate agent takes me to view a house, I expect to be able to look round it without necessarily being allowed to spend time there investigating the state of the plumbing. A viewing, in ordinary language, is not the same thing as an inspection. Patient forums have the right to enter and inspect, as did CHCs before them. Why is not the word &#147;inspect&#148; used here as well, and what significance should we attach to that?</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="07072349000006"></a>Secondly, I return to what LINks will be there to do. When they decide to enter and view premises, they will not be there simply to observe the activities going on within them. The point of entering is to monitor the quality and effectiveness of the services being provided. I believe that there is a strong case for having that explicitly stated in the Bill. As the Bill stands, the duty on services providers will extend only to allowing authorised representatives to enter, view and observe. Without a purposive context to this, I would worry that certain services providers might take it upon themselves to deny LINks members a full opportunity to gather the kind of information that they need from the visit. The amendment would strengthen the duty by making it clear that it is not sufficient to allow a nominal sort of viewing or observation by LINks members; it is necessary also to facilitate them in carrying out their task.</p>

<a name="70723-0016.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="07072349000007"></a>I turn finally to Amendment No. 238W, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, will speak more fully. I simply want to say this. I understand that the Government propose to make provision in regulations that visits to premises by authorised representatives may not take place unless the LINk has previously notified the appropriate regulatory body of its intention and the regulator has not objected. I can quite see why we should want to avoid inundating services providers with inspections and visits from myriad inspecting bodies. However, I seriously question whether a blanket limitation of the kind proposed is the right way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="07072349000008"></a>If LINks are to have any credibility at all with the local community, they need to have their own visiting regime, including the ability to make spot visits where  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_656"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there is an urgent concern. The scope for such visits to make a difference to the quality of care is considerable, but if you hedge those visits about with bureaucratic processes and permissions from a remote national body, that potential will be greatly diluted. Indeed, the extent of the restrictions that the Secretary of State can impose through the regulation-making power is so great that I wonder what, if any, freedom of movement will be left to LINks at the end of it all. Patient forum members will tell you that visits to premises are important both to raise public confidence in the NHS and for public safety. The regulations are likely to create a wall between local people and the services that they pay for. I believe that that wall would undermine public confidence in patient and public involvement and in the independence of LINks. I beg to move.</p>

Frankly, one is given the impression that the powers of LINks will be considerably less than the powers of PPI forums and that their ability to be heard will be less, which is perhaps even more important. One should not forget that the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health was a national body that could amplify any concern that a PPI forum might have had in the past. It had considerable power, exercised with considerable responsibility. I believe that there was not a single complaint as a result of the visits, which says quite a lot.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="07072349000011"></a>Amendment No. 238W is about the conditions to be satisfied before a duty arises in a particular place. It is rather insulting and belittling that one will be subjected to those conditions. I understand that it is a matter of security in a private care home that is being inspected. &#147;Inspection&#148; must be the word that is used if we are to have any confidence in this. The position seems to be: &#147;It may be one, two or three people, we are not quite certain and goodness only knows how many people you are going to consult&#148;.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="07072349000012"></a>I am particularly impressed with the nursing side. The Royal College of Nursing is not really impressed with some of the suggestions and does not see them as likely to provide the comfort that we are looking for. I shall not say any more because the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has put the matter so well and my noble friend has made a very graphic point about the television programme. I echo her view that, if possible, the Minister should see it. Other noble Lords and I believe that this matter is very much the key to whether this is going to work and whether we can regard the new organisation as an equal, if not better organisation, which looks after the different interests of people, which actually delivers and which is not seen as a fairly amorphous body without any teeth.</p>

We are all deeply concerned that LINks will not have powers. It is clear that regulations will be written that are likely to restrict, very considerably, what LINks can do in terms of inspection. We are all extremely worried by that.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="07072349000014"></a>I wish to draw two things to the Minister&#146;s attention. One is that there appears to be a desire to limit the hours when LINks members can inspect or visit. That seems quite serious because it more or less prevents any opportunity for spot checks. If you talk to members of patient forums and people who have been involved in any kind of inspection and monitoring of any service, they will tell you that one thing that you need to have is a right, if you like, to make spot checks to see that things have not been prepared so that they look better than they normally are. I would be very grateful if the noble Baroness could clarify that point in her response.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="07072349000015"></a>The other thing is a point that I raised at Second Reading with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about the idea that on Healthcare Commission inspections, which can be both spot checks and arranged visits, a LINk person or patient representative should go along as part of that team. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that he would take that away and look at it. As far as I am aware, the Healthcare Commission is not opposed to that idea at all. If we really want to strengthen the role of LINks in monitoring and inspecting our services, that is one way to do so, but they need to have a right to inspect when they want as well.</p>

<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="07072349000016"></a><b><a name="70723-0017.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07072349000067"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> These are indeed important amendments and I want to reassure noble Lords in different ways. I am grateful to them for raising the issue, because it merits clarity and debate.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="07072349000017"></a>Obviously, the issues that Amendment No. 238VD raises came up quite a lot at Second Reading. It is important to state here, as was stated then, that in practical terms &#147;view&#148; and &#147;inspect&#148; mean much the same thing and that the use of &#147;view&#148; does not in any way diminish the power that LINks have to enter services. I hear what the noble Lord says about &#147;view&#148; sounding rather passive, but the term was chosen specifically to recognise that LINk participants are not inspectors or regulators. The term &#147;inspect&#148; relates to professional regulatory bodies such as the Healthcare Commission. Those involved in LINks are lay people and, as such, are able to take the patient and user perspective. There is not any diminishment of power from the patient forums and I suggest that noble Lords reconsider their arguments because of that. However, I am keen to be helpful and, because noble Lords are clearly of a mind that this is an important matter, I will take it away and think it through.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="07072349000018"></a>Amendments Nos. 238VE and 238XA both seek to ensure that LINks can monitor services when they visit them. Again, I understand the purpose of these amendments; we have already considered it. That is why Clause 225(4)(a) states that any visit by a LINk must be,</p>
<ul><a name="07072349000058"></a>&#147;carried out for the purposes of carrying-on&#148;,</ul>



<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_658"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 658</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="07072349000054"></a>LINks activities. Clause 222(2) lists one of the LINks&#146; activities as,</p>
<ul><a name="07072349000059"></a>&#147;enabling people to monitor, and review, the commissioning and provision of local care services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072349000055"></a>I hope that that meets the point raised by the noble Lord and that he will not press his amendment, because it is captured in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="07072349000019"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 238W and 238X. We think that the power to interview and observe is very important for LINks to be effective. The power of LINks extends beyond that of patient forums to cover social care as well as health. We also believe that it is important to take account of some key issues when providing for LINk members to enter and view services to protect service users&#146; safety and dignity, as well as to safeguard the smooth operation of services. Clause 285 therefore sets out some areas where detail is required when the Secretary of State makes regulations in respect of those powers. Amendments Nos. 238W and 238X seek to remove the power to make these conditions and safeguards.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="07072349000020"></a>I accept that it appears that we are giving LINks power with one hand and taking it away with the other, so it is very important to be clear. The power to enter premises is a formidable one and rarely given; giving it to members of the public is extremely significant. I am sure that noble Lords agree that we cannot be lax enough simply to allow the power to be used without safeguards. We have to bear in mind the fact that it is not just the power to enter premises; it is the power to enter premises where ill, vulnerable and distraught people are receiving treatment.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="07072349000021"></a>Subsection (2)(a) allows for conditions to be satisfied before the duty arises. This will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations that state, for example, that a LINk must inform the regulator before undertaking a visit to a services provider. I understand what noble Lords have said and I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. This is part of a cross-government gatekeeper initiative that, with the best of intentions, aims to reduce the burden on front-line service providers and to prevent duplication, endless visits and people having to stop looking after people, which is much more important, in order to take someone around, facilitate discussions and so on. We think that it is particularly appropriate in the case of LINks that their visits should be co-ordinated with the work of the regulator to ensure that there is no duplication of effort.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="07072349000022"></a>These details would be set out in regulations and specify areas where we do not expect people to enter and view, such as in children&#146;s premises, and so on. We intend to publish draft regulations and conduct a full consultation on them before we lay them in Parliament.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="07072349000023"></a>Amendment No. 238X seeks to remove subsection (3), which would allow for limitations on the right to enter and view premises. For example, we would intend that a LINk should visit only when appropriate&#151;that is, when services are being provided. Equally, it is important to retain the ability to provide some detail on the number of LINk members visiting premises&#151;for example, it could become clear that it would be appropriate to have a minimum of two LINk members on each  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_659"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 659</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>visit. I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, at Second Reading. I will follow that up, because it has interesting potential.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="07072349000024"></a>I believe that the powers set out in Clause 225 represent important parameters on the duty, but I am conscious that noble Lords have spoken with one voice on the importance of unannounced visits. I am not making any promises, because this is part of a cross-government attempt to rationalise the way in which inspections are made, but I will take this matter away and talk to officials and Ministers about this and come back on Report to make our recommendations.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="07072349000025"></a>I should say that all those involved in this part of the LINks role will have to have the right skills, receive the right training, be cleared by the CRB and be able to demonstrate understanding of patient confidentiality. It is a serious undertaking and we are putting serious measures in place to ensure that it is done properly.</p>

I cannot see that visitors will endlessly pour into care homes with vulnerable patients who are sometimes never visited. It is a different matter when patients are visited by family and friends, but many people are put in suspect homes and are vulnerable. It is surely our duty to ensure that someone goes in to check the food and to see whether patients are being hit. That is protecting people. These LINk people will have so much to do that they will not have much time.</p>

However, I take the noble Baroness&#146;s point&#151;there may not be lots of LINks visits, but people go into care homes for many different reasons, not least CSCI inspectors, who make unannounced visits. It is a question of getting a balance between being able to offer the sort of insight and potential protection for vulnerable people and not overburdening hard-working and dedicated staff and taking them away from their front-line responsibilities.</p>

I am the chairman of a mental health trust in east London and my organisation would fall within the remit of a local  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_660"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 660</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>involvement network. Nevertheless, I hope that my brief remarks will be constructive and will support the Minister in her deliberations about Part 14.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="07072349000033"></a>In declaring my interest in this matter, I make very clear my strong commitment to service-user involvement in service provision. In mental health we have been working long and hard to involve our service users in a meaningful and fulfilling way. Indeed when I became chairman of the trust, one of my first actions was to create a service-user sub-committee of the trust board at the very highest level of the organisation. In that committee the various representatives of our many service-user forums across the trust come together with board directors to discuss policy and any issues of concern to those service-user representatives.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="07072349000034"></a>In questioning the inclusion of LINks in this legislation for health services, I emphasise that I am an advocate of user and public involvement. However, I believe that Part 14 requires some more work before it is set is stone. The creation of LINks to ensure public involvement in the monitoring of social care facilities&#151;the social care homes and nursing homes to which the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, referred&#151;where such visits are lacking, may prove a helpful way forward. My concerns in relation to this are limited to the health services, and in particular the mental health services.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="07072349000035"></a>Clause 225 places on the service providers a duty to allow entry by local involvement networks to,</p>
<ul><a name="07072349000060"></a>&#147;view and observe the carrying-on of activities on premises owned or controlled by the services-provider&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07072349000056"></a>as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. If LINks are to be established and have a right of entry to view the staff and patients on wards, I would strongly support the Government&#146;s provision that some restrictions will need to be placed upon that right. However, I have an apparently controversial view within this House that there should not be another body whose members will visit hospital wards at this time before further detailed work is done; I strongly emphasise that work. By it, as I will say later on in relation to other clauses, what I mean is that these LINks should be piloted and evaluated, and we should be absolutely sure that they are effective and efficient and work to the benefit of patients and service users before we find these things being brought into play.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="07072349000036"></a>Why do I take this view? We know that there are already inordinate numbers of bodies charged with visits to hospitals and hospital wards for one reason or another. The number 56 has been referred to in relation to the total number of bodies that come into health services for inspections and monitoring. I just want to mention five. The Mental Health Act Commission undertakes announced and unannounced visits to wards to inspect the operation of the Mental Health Act 1983. It checks on care and treatment of detained patients.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="07072349000037"></a>When the commission has merged with the Healthcare Commission, I understand that its ward visits and interviews with patients will continue. The Healthcare Commission visits hospital wards, as other noble Lords have mentioned. Again, those visits can be announced or unannounced. Mental Health Act managers regularly visit wards. They are members of the public rather  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_661"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 661</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than NHS professionals. Apart from undertaking appeals at the request of patients, those managers are concerned about the standard and quality of care of patients and the individual patient&#146;s experience of that care.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="07072349000038"></a>Mental health review tribunal members have a right to see patients on the ward. The new boards of governors of foundation trusts also need to have access to wards and other facilities that are managed by the trust. Those bodies, like LINks, represent patients, service users, carers and the public. That is the nub of what I feel so strongly about. I will say more about these boards in relation to other clauses.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="07072349000039"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, suggested&#151;helpfully, I think&#151;that a LINk member might joint a Healthcare Commission visit. However, the boards of governors will want to join those visits. There really is a duplication here in relation to the health sector but not, I fully accept, in relation to social services. Both sets of people&#151;service users, carers and the public&#151;will go around assuming that they are the key body that represents users, carers and the public; they will monitor services, feed back to providers, want their views to be taken seriously and so on. How will all that work?</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="07072349000040"></a>Unlike care homes, hospital wards are overwhelmed by visits from inspectors and monitoring bodies and governors add the all-important voice of service users and carers. If LINks also visit wards, they will risk duplicating precisely what governing bodies will be doing. The wards really cannot cope with that sort of duplication.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="07072349000041"></a>Leaving inspection on one side, wards are under the most incredible pressures these days&#151;greater pressures than they have ever experienced&#151;because the in-patient population is ever more challenging: more and more patients are managed within the community even when they have very severe psychotic symptoms. Only the most ill and high-risk people ever get into a hospital ward these days.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="07072349000042"></a>The value added of every inspection&#151;every monitoring visit&#151;should be carefully assessed to ensure that the benefit to patients and service users really does outweigh the distraction of staff from the job in hand and disruption to those very disturbed patients.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="07072349000043"></a>I hope that the Minister will agree to commission work to analyse the many demands on hospital wards and how best to avoid duplication by LINks and boards of governors of foundation trusts in particular before pressing ahead with Clause 225.</p>

I take that point entirely. We can also learn from experience. These powers were those of the patients&#146; forums. It is important for us and all potential LINk organisations to be able to look at this.</p>

She has become a member of a board of governors and plans to pursue her PPI functions through it. That is interesting because people here have talked about LINks replacing PPI. In my experience on the ground, boards of governors are replacing PPI. That is, perhaps, something to think about.</p>

The relationship between boards of governors and LINks must converge rather than duplicate. We want to see foundation trusts joining LINks and contributing to their research, and vice versa. There must be synergy here; that is common sense. This is something we want the local authorities to urge the host to do. Maybe you could put it in a contract. One of the protocols would be that you were not duplicating the work of people who had other relationships with the sector. That is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="70723-0017.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="07072349000048"></a>With regard to the mental health function in particular, since LINks are bringing together social care and health, we will have for the first time a convergence of interests, although I would not say that it will be seamless. It is likely that more consumer interests will overlap in relation to mental health than in other parts of the health and social care services. It is possible that giving LINks powers to enter and view, particularly when it comes to mental health, will bring a slightly different dimension to it. I do not know; I will leave that for the noble Baroness to think about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="07072349000049"></a>The noble Baroness has made a very powerful contribution.

We are probing whether the Government would be content for a person such as a parent to take such responsibility. Surely the LINk should take responsibility. If the LINk is to mean anything, its members must have views about all this, and so should have a duty to prepare and produce an annual report. Essentially it belongs to them. I very much hope that the Minister can reassure me on this matter. I beg to move.</p>

I am not entirely certain that I will give the noble Baroness much satisfaction on this. It comes back to the rather circular argument about the LINks not being on the face of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 238AB and 239ZA seek to make it a requirement that once the annual report has been drafted it should be distributed in such a manner as members of the local involvement network, having had regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State, consider appropriate. As the clause is currently drafted, the person preparing the report should have regard to the guidance, and the noble Baroness has asked us to change that.</p>
<a name="time_40"></a>
<a name="70723-0018.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="0707249000104"></a>10.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a><a name="0707249000006"></a>There are problems with mentioning the members of LINks in the Bill because, as we said, the notion of membership may be conditional. We do not wish to pre-empt LINks in organising their governance structure and ways of working&#151;as I said, some may want a notion of &#147;membership&#148; and others may not. However, there is a further complexity. Although it is somewhat complex&#151;that is quite an admission&#151;Clause 227 has been drafted carefully to ensure that someone is always responsible for writing an annual report for LINks. Usually, the host will assist the LINk in the preparing the annual report. However, the provision is drafted as it is because at times a LINk may not be in place&#151;for example, when the host has recently been set up and the LINk&#146;s structure is not yet defined and it has not yet begun to undertake its activities. In that case, the host will still be expected to cover in its annual report the activities that it has undertaken.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="0707249000007"></a>It would not be workable to accept Amendments Nos. 238AB and 239ZA because members of a LINk may not necessarily be available to decide how an annual report should be distributed. Therefore, we think it appropriate that whoever drafts the annual report should have regard to the statutory guidance in deciding how it should be distributed. Perhaps we could think about making some sort of reference to that in the guidance. With regard to who will receive the report, it will certainly be made available to the general public&#151;that is the whole point of the exercise&#151;and it will also go to the overview and scrutiny committee, the local authority, the PCT, the other partners and the Secretary of State. Therefore, it will have a wide circulation.</p>

That was very nice. She also said that she envisaged a situation where a host might prepare the annual report because the LINk did not yet exist. Can the noble Baroness foresee a situation where, for some reason or another, a local authority might appoint a host but a LINk either might not come into existence quickly or might not come into existence at all? How would that work? I had not thought about it until she mentioned it, but it seems to me that it is worth testing whether that is a possibility and, if so, how the structure would then operate.</p>

Again, that would be a cause for concern. We have not set timetables on this because in some areas&#151;large rural areas, for example&#151;it might be difficult to establish a mechanism for people to come together and there would be a loss of virtual activity.

<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="0707249000019"></a>The power will not mean that a LINk cannot include issues and matters that it thinks are important, as a LINk is an independent mechanism and can of course highlight areas that it thinks should be made public. Indeed, it could do so at any time&#151;definitely not only in the annual report. The power enables the Secretary of State to seek the views of LINks on matters that may be of particular importance. For example, it may be that the Department of Health would welcome insights from LINks in developing policies on issues of access to services, or on the impact of legislation such as the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="0707249000020"></a>Similarly, the Secretary of State may well wish to be able to take a holistic view of specific aspects of LINks activities; for example, how many people from vulnerable groups have been involved in them. That insight could only be achieved by requiring all LINks to provide information on the same topic. Essentially, then, we are looking for the ability for LINks to populate their reports in a way that enables us to make comparison.</p>

Since consideration of the Bill in the other place, its drafting has been reviewed to ensure that a consistent approach is adopted to any provisions relating to directions and guidance. As a result, some amendments are needed to Clause 227 to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill. Clause 227 deals with LINks&#146; annual reports; subsection 3(a) enables the Secretary of State to give directions about the matters dealt with in a LINks annual report, and subsection 2(d) means that regard must be had to,</p>
<ul><a name="0707249000100"></a>&#147;guidance issued by the Secretary of State&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0707249000088"></a>on how a LINks annual report is to be made &#147;publicly available&#148;.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a><a name="0707249000022"></a>Amendments Nos. 240, 241 and 242 therefore do two things between them. First, they remove the express requirement for directions and guidance under the clause to be in writing, which is to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill. However, directions and guidance under the clause will still have to be in writing, since subsection (11) requires them to be published.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="0707249000023"></a>Secondly, they remove the express power to vary or revoke guidance given for the purposes of the clause. That is also to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill. Such an express power is considered unnecessary since guidance may generally be issued, varied or revoked without statutory authority. As a result, including such an express power under this clause might wrongly lead the reader to conclude that there was no power to vary or revoke guidance under other provisions of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="0707249000024"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 239 provides that the guidance to be referred to when preparing an annual report is the guidance,</p>
<ul><a name="0707249000101"></a>&#147;in force at that time&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0707249000089"></a>This clarifies the obligation where guidance has been amended over the course of time. Without that clarification, a reader might at first think that the reference was to the guidance in force when the local authority made the arrangements with the LINks host. I beg to move.</p>

That largely satisfied my curiosity, as this was a probing amendment and I felt that in the light of her remarks about the independence of LINks it was a little strange that we should have a power of direction from the Secretary of State over what the LINks had to include in their annual reports. Nevertheless, I can see that in some circumstances there could be merit in this idea, just so long as it is not carried to excess, as then it could constitute an unreasonable infringement into the independence of LINks.</p>

<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="0707249000034"></a><b><a name="70723-0018.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="0707249000120"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I rise to speak to the clause stand part Motions in relation to Clauses 229, 230 and 231. In so doing, I ask the Minister to consider whether she is sufficiently well prepared at this stage to justify abolishing patients&#146; forums, their functions and their parent body, the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. I also wish to speak to Amendment No. 252A, which would ensure that if LINks are introduced, nothing will be done to abolish PPI forums or the commission until host organisations have been appointed in every local authority area. The purpose of Amendment No. 252A is to ensure that there is not a hiatus between the demise of PPI forums and the creation of LINks, if this is what happens. I hope the Minister will accept that principle.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="0707249000035"></a>I want to focus on the clause stand part Motions. In so doing, I fully accept that patients&#146; forums have been restricted to monitoring health service providers; they have not had a remit for commissioning bodies, as others have mentioned, social care providers or institutions  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_667"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 667</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the criminal justice system, which provide a form of service for many of the most disadvantaged people. There is therefore a need to fill the gaps in the system. I am just not yet convinced that LINks are the best way to do that, and I am not sure how anyone else can be convinced with the present state of knowledge. My main concern is that the world has moved on while the preparatory work has been undertaken for the introduction of LINks. The Government in their paper on local government networks, creating a stronger voice in health and social care, claim that LINks differ from previous systems as they are based on broad networks rather than small specialist groups involving representatives from organisations as well as individuals. Indeed, the Minister indicated that LINks are some incredibly new and unique form of organisation, but I have to say that that statement is not really correct. The model already in place in foundation trusts is similarly based on broad networks and involves representatives from organisations as well as individuals. Indeed, the whole idea of these boards of governors and the membership is that they should cover every conceivable small group, BME community group and so on.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a><a name="0707249000036"></a>The Government envisage that all health provider trusts will be foundation trusts by 2008 and that all foundation trusts will have boards of governors, sometimes called members councils, comprising patients, service users, carers, members of the public, representatives of voluntary organisations and, as I have mentioned, BME communities and so forth. The majority of board members are elected by the thousands of public and staff members who have been signed up to each foundation trust. The regulatory authority expects each foundation trust to have between 5,000 and 8,000 members. That is roughly what has been said in relation to LINks; that they should have thousands of members and all the little groups and voluntary organisations. My understanding is that primary care trusts will also become foundation trusts, with boards of governors and a broad membership, so we are all going to be hunting in the same pool, the same borough, if you like, for these thousands of members and for every conceivable group to sign up.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="0707249000037"></a>These clauses in the Bill provide for the abolition of patients&#146; forums to make way for the proposed LINks. My suggestion is that in the health sector it may be more sensible to retain patients&#146; forums at this stage while the LINks pilots, to which I have already referred, are undertaken, while they are evaluated and while the boards of governors are evaluated. They have never been evaluated, so perhaps they are not the right way forward&#151;I am simply saying that we do not know. The question concerning me is whether the introduction of LINks to the health service, as I referred to in relation to the previous debate, will duplicate the structure as well as the work of boards of governors.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a><a name="0707249000038"></a>The House of Commons Health Committee report 2006-07 rightly pointed out that the foundation trust system is still in its infancy. I would be the first to say that foundation trust boards of governors will take several years to find their feet, to operate really effectively in representing the interests of patients, service users and carers and to ensure that services respond to those  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_668"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interests and needs. A Peer I was talking to over dinner said that similar organisations that he is aware of have taken 10 years to settle down and be really effective. This is the sort of issue that all of us need to be aware of; these things do not just happen overnight. My point here is that these PPI boards need to be evaluated before anything further is done. Indeed, the Government&#146;s regulator, Monitor, warned of the same problem of duplication.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="0707249000039"></a>The situation may not be helped if there are two sets of bodies struggling to find their feet. On the face of it there are possible advantages in either of these two systems. Maybe LINks will be better than boards of governors. Certainly on paper they appear to be more independent. But as I understand these two sets of systems, the boards of governors look to me to be very much stronger and more effective potentially for patients, service users, carers and everybody else.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a><a name="0707249000040"></a>The crucial element here is that LINks do not appear to have any powers; what they have is activities. I will just go through some of the powers and responsibilities of these boards of governors&#151;they are quite interesting. These boards, comprising more than 50 per cent of users and carers, elected quite interesting bodies. The boards of governors must be consulted on forward planning by the board of directors and the board of directors must have regard to their views. They have to explain if they do not put those views into effect. The board of governors must approve the appointment of the chief executive of the trust. The process of this incredibly important appointment must be made under the scrutiny of these boards of governors. The board of governors hires and fires the chairman of these trusts. Will a trust chairman allow the board of directors to disregard the governors in any respect? I do not think so. This is a masterstroke by the Government. It will ensure that every health trust board, whether a commissioner or provider, will in future take full account of their patient service user, carer and public representatives.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a><a name="0707249000041"></a>The board of governors, we are told, will represent the interests of the trust&#146;s thousands of members and partner organisations in the governance of the trust. The board of governors will hold the board of directors to account for the performance of the trust; that is, the quality of services delivered to patients and service users. The role of LINks appears rather weak by comparison. We are told that they will have a role in promoting and supporting the involvement of people in the commissioning, provision and scrutiny of services. They will be obtaining the views of people about their need for, and experiences of, services. There is no indication that those views will be taken seriously, although the Minister made a useful contribution on that issue. They will be enabling people to monitor and review the commissioning and provision of services. As I have said before, there is a terrible fear of duplication here. They will make their views known to the people responsible for commissioning, providing, managing and scrutinising those services. But they will be at arm&#146;s length. The boards of governors are going to be right there; these trusts cannot ignore them. They are independent and they are right there, with these powers and they can report direct to the regulator if they are not happy with the way the trust board treats them.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a><a name="0707249000042"></a>The foundation trust boards of governors will regard all the roles of the LINks as essential to the exercise of their powers. The roles under the two systems may look different on paper because the boards of governors have defined powers whereas LINks will have defined activities, but in reality the LINks may simply turn out to be a less powerful form of boards of governors. Certainly the questions relevant to LINks set out on page 18 of the Government&#146;s consultation document are precisely the questions that boards of governors will be addressing. But my main point in speaking to these clause stand part motions is that none of us is yet in a position to know whether LINks will have any real value for the health service over and above what we have in the boards of governors.</p>

<a name="70723-0018.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a><a name="0707249000043"></a>I shall mention briefly two further issues. In abolishing the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, the Government apparently have no plans to create a national body in its place to support the work of the LINks. Noble Lords have already had a bit of a discussion about that, but in my view a national body is essential, and it is of no little interest that the boards of governors have not had a national body. So the Foundation Trust Network, the national body supporting foundation trusts, is now going through the process of setting up a national body to support the boards of governors. If there is going to be a national body for the LINks, we shall then have two national bodies for patient, service user, carer and public user bodies apparently duplicating each other&#146;s work.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a><a name="0707249000044"></a>Again, and most important, I repeat that the crucial point is that we need pilots and evaluation. I am sure that we all agree that patient and public involvement is central to achieving the high quality services we want, but none should underestimate the difficulties of organising this work, particularly in the mental health field. In my experience, PPI forums have struggled desperately to operate effectively. Rushing into the establishment of LINks, albeit after a lot of discussion and consultation, is a very high-risk strategy. I hope that the noble Baroness will give consideration to the points I have raised.</p>

It seeks simply to ensure that the LINks are up and running before the current fora and the commission are abolished. The changeover from the old system to the new could be compared with runners in a relay race. If it is done in a hurry, the baton may be dropped and the runners will lose touch with each other. I suggest that there should be a whole lap in which the two systems run together before the baton is handed over. It should be done when the skills and experience of the fora and the commission have been handed over properly so that the LINks are functioning well before we say goodbye to the old system.</p>

In her letter of 9 July the Minister said that it was not possible to adapt the current system because of the way that forums are set down in legislation. She said that one would have to change their statutory basis completely. I think I need to understand a little better why that is. It does not seem to be a proposition that is self-evident, and the advantage of that approach as opposed to the one taken by the Government is that it would have afforded a measure of continuity, the lack of which endangers the good will of the volunteers in the field.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="0707249000047"></a>I want to comment on Amendment No. 252A. The abolition of patient forums, we understand, is set for 31 March 2008 and from the Minister&#146;s letter of 9 July it seems inevitable that we are facing a gap between their disappearance and the arrival of LINks, the very thing that many of us most want to avoid. In her letter the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="0707249000098"></a>&#147;We do not believe that a small gap will be a serious concern&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707249000090"></a>I disagree with her on that very strongly. I do not know what she means by a small gap&#151;perhaps she will tell us&#151;but it has to be a cause of concern that any kind of gap in the provision of patient and public involvement is considered acceptable to her department.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a><a name="0707249000048"></a>My questions to the Minister are these. Has a gap been built into the department plans? What steps is the Minister taking to make sure such a gap is avoided? What, if any, financial or organisational obstacles exist to militate against the desirable aim of achieving the smooth transition that many of us want to see?</p>

<p><a name="st_239"></a>
<a name="0707249000049"></a><b><a name="70723-0019.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0707249000123"></a>Baroness Neuberger:</b> I, too, had prepared a quite lengthy speech for these clause stand part debates but, like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I shall address only a few points because we are running so late.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a><a name="0707249000050"></a>On the letter from the Minister of 9 July, I, too, am very concerned about the gap. It is extraordinary for the Minister to say that she does not believe that a small gap is of serious concern. I believe it is a very serious concern and noble Lords all round the Chamber are clear that it is of serious concern. I say that for two reasons. First, if we are serious about patient and public involvement, the shortest of gaps will destroy the drive to do it better and just discourage people. Secondly&#151;the Minister was well aware I was going to raise this point because I have raised it privately with her and the Minister in the other place, Ann Keen&#151;the abolition of the patient forums and treating the volunteers who are part of those patient forums in such a cavalier way is unacceptable. To say that it does not matter if there is a gap suggests that we are better off without them than with them. It is an extraordinary thing for the Government to do.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a><a name="0707249000051"></a>The Minister knows that I have had many representations made to me by members of patient forums. She also knows that I have this new and somewhat strange role as volunteering champion for the Prime Minister. I find myself now in an impossible position as far as the treatment of volunteers in this arena is concerned. The hundreds of people making representations should not be treated in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_491"></a><a name="0707249000052"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us that such a gap will not occur and that there will be continuity in patient and public involvement.

I have listened to the debate with considerable interest because it summarises the real concerns that we all feel. My noble friend Lady Meacher has made some very interesting points that are well worth considering. We must not have a gap. Equally, what is being suggested shows a vague lack of appreciation of the numbers of bodies and the number of duplications involved. We do not know what they are and it would seem very sensible to carry out research before any gap occurs. Abolition must not take place if we are to have any credibility, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, said. There is time to do that research, to see what is happening and to see whether there is a suitable existing national body. I am as equally convinced as my noble friend that there is a need for a national body, not only the PPIs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_492"></a><a name="0707249000054"></a>It would be a good idea if the Minister could say something to the body which is to be finally abolished after nine resurrections, shall we say. It has done its duty, as it saw it. It might have been yet another example of something ill-considered that was set up far too quickly before it had to be rethought, but that is not its fault. It has been extremely helpful in briefing the rest of us, along with all the people who have written to us from all sorts of different medical, voluntary and patient bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_493"></a><a name="0707249000055"></a>I hope that there will be some rethinking on the whole issue for the benefit of everyone, not least the Government, and that someone will try to say something nice about the national body to it directly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"></a><a name="0707249000057"></a>I start with the case made by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. I know she thinks that LINks are unnecessary and will duplicate the work of foundation trust boards. They are not unnecessary, for all the reasons I have given in the course of the debate today. They will not overlap with the foundation trust boards, which are doing something very different. They are institution-based, while LINks are area-based and cover social care and healthcare. LINks will include organisations that might have an almost marginal attachment to health, and yet whose members will be affected by health provision. The bodies will do different things in different ways. Although I understand the noble Baroness&#146;s anxiety, she should not worry about it in the way she is.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a><a name="0707249000058"></a>I repeat what I said earlier: the business of conversions, co-option and co-operation will be the way forward. We are talking about new animals.

Now here we are, worrying about whether they will overlap with an organisation that is fundamentally different. No doubt we will come back to some of this on Report, but I hope that in the mean time the noble Baroness and I can talk some more about it privately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"></a><a name="0707249000059"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked why we need something separate; why we cannot just evolve a system. He also asked key questions about the transition. The reason we need something new in legislation is simply because LINks are different from PCTs. A patients&#146; forum was established for every trust, while LINks will cover an area. Forums are generally small organisations of seven or eight members, while there is much greater scope for LINks and a different governance arrangement. Forums have been established for NHS institutions, while LINks will look at both healthcare and social care. We have not spoken today about just how significant a change that is, and how maddening and frustrating it has been over the years that healthcare and social care have been separate, with all the disability that that has built into the system. LINks will support capacity in the local and voluntary sectors in different ways and will tap into the excellent work and experience that already exists. For all those reasons this is a fresh start.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a><a name="0707249000060"></a>We want a transition that is as smooth and easy as possible. I take the noble Baroness&#146;s point that people have made a commitment, and once you lose your purpose as a volunteer it is easy never to return. It is very difficult to recapture that enthusiasm, and local authorities must think about that as they move into contracting organisations, since those are the people who will deliver for them.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a><a name="0707249000061"></a>When I spoke about a small gap, I was trying to be as honest and realistic with noble Lords as possible, maybe to take them into my confidence. We could not realistically expect to establish new bodies without some sort of changeover, and it was better to admit the possibility that not every LINk would be up and running in March next year rather than to be overconfident. We must be careful. We are trying to learn from experience.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a><a name="0707249000062"></a>As for how small is a small gap, it is difficult to quantify. There were two reasons why we have had to move in this way. I will not go through the clause stand part but will move instead to the substance of the amendment. We have been in this situation since 2004. There has been a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety. We have not exactly rushed into this but there has been a build-up of anxiety, which we need to address and resolve. For the past two years, forum members have said to us, &#147;Whatever you decide, decide quickly because we need to move on&#148;. That is an important point. We are creating a new system with a fresh start&#151;a step change.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a><a name="0707249000063"></a>What will we do to achieve a smooth transition? I will not go through all the detail but it includes everything that we set out in the letter to noble Lords. We knew that the timing would be contentious so we put activity in place early on to inform and mobilise people. Local authorities need to be thinking about hosts. Three-quarters of them already have someone in place whose responsibility it is to identify the host.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"></a><a name="0707249000064"></a>We have put a raft of activities in place to inform stakeholders; we have been holding regional events over the past couple of months with key stakeholders and there is the work of the early adopter projects. Many local authorities are starting work to warm up the potential host market and will report back to us. Many are planning to run events as well as mapping local activity and bringing together local partners, but the crucial thing is to have the host in place. There is considerable interest from organisations that would like to do that and we will shortly be providing them with model contracts. Local authorities will be under a statutory duty to make contractual arrangements. We are soon to write to all local authorities attaching the model specification. After that, the documentation will make it clear that local authorities can carry out activity now to kick-start the arrangements.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a><a name="0707249000065"></a>Activities include identifying lead personnel; identifying prospective host organisations; raising awareness among potential hosts; telling the media what LINks will do; trying to suss out who might be interested in being a host; putting in place a draft timetable and project plan; keeping track of the progress of the Bill; bringing stakeholders together; and mapping who will be involved. Local authorities will be encouraged to get together with neighbouring authorities to talk about jointly procuring a host organisation to support more than one LINk, for example.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a><a name="0707249000066"></a>I have spoken about the regional rotas. There is a monthly newsletter. We are working with the Centre for Public Scrutiny, the Healthcare Commission, CSCI, the care services improvement partnerships, the NHS National Centre for Involvement, and so on. </p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a><a name="0707249000067"></a>Procurement work starts in August. Some local authorities have already done this, giving them time to have in place contracts with hosts prior to the closure of forums. There is much to be done. There is also anxiety and uncertainty, and it is our job to build confidence and overcome that. It is a major change, which is why we are working across the field.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a><a name="0707249000068"></a>On Amendment No. 252A, of course I understand why noble Lords are anxious about this issue, and I applaud them for it. We intend to commence the legislation in such a way as to support a straightforward move into LINks. If the amendment were accepted, however, all patient forums, as well as the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, would remain in place until every local authority had made contractual arrangements for LINk activities. If even one local authority was slow to establish a LINk for its area, every other area would have to run two systems in parallel. That would be very impractical; the same people would be involved and it would be very expensive to scrutinise the same services. It does not make sense.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a><a name="0707249000069"></a>Over the next two or three months, the picture will become much clearer. When we come back on Report, there will be more clarity and visibility about the progress that has been made.</p>

There seems to be a great impetus within the Department of Health to have the mergers and the changes in the various regulatory and arm&#146;s-length bodies in place by March 2008. However, those early adopter patient forums are saying, in terms, &#147;This is too fast. We can&#146;t do it at that pace&#148;. It is fine for the local authorities to be active&#151;it is absolutely great if they are trying to find hosts&#151;but if the early adopters are saying that it is too fast and if the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough is saying, &#147;Come on, guys, let&#146;s go for evolution, not revolution&#148;, do we not have to listen a little harder?</p>

That is what has inspired what we are trying to do. I am not sure what there would be to gain from delay, because people find ways of spinning things out. Timetables are important. We could have had many more early adopters. All over the country, people were really interested not in being pilots, because these are not pilots, but in testing out the way things might happen in the future. However, I am listening to what the noble Baroness says. We will certainly have an opportunity to talk to the early adopters during the summer.</p>

She just said that delaying would not be a good idea. The one reason for allowing a little more time would be to give the Government the time not just to have some more early adopters but also to set up and pilot some LINks in a particular area, really making sure that they can work in the social care and other sectors. It will be incredibly difficult to turn them into effective and efficient organisations&#151;this is tough territory. It will be a pity if, in five years, they are being wound up as yet another failure, but I have to say that it is difficult to anticipate that they will not be in that position unless they are piloted.</p>

The trouble with pilots is that they often take a long time, to be evaluated not least, and they test everything at the same time, whereas we were looking for a way in which different sorts of organisation could test different bits of a new system. That is my understanding at least.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_675"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 675</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which became Section 242 of the NHS Act 2006, placed a duty on NHS bodies to ensure that service users are,</p>
<ul><a name="0707249000102"></a>&#147;involved in and consulted on&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0707249000091"></a>the planning of the provision of health services and any proposed changes in those services. I paraphrase the duty slightly, but the words that I wish to emphasise here are &#147;involved in&#148;.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a><a name="0707249000079"></a>Clause 232 amends Section 11&#151;if I may continue to call it that&#151;and in so doing removes the words &#147;involved in&#148;, keeping only the words &#147;consulted on&#148;. There is an obvious irony in the fact that a Bill that contains &#147;involvement&#148; in its title should remove that very concept from a key part of the Bill. Why have the Government done this? According to the Minister&#146;s letter of 9 July, it was because of the judicial review in the case of north-east Derbyshire, when the judge found it difficult to perceive any real difference between &#147;involve&#148; and &#147;consult&#148;, so &#147;involve&#148; has been taken out. In her letter, the Minister said that she did not think that anything would be lost by doing that. I must respectfully beg to differ with her on that&#151;and, equally respectfully, with the judge in the case of north-east Derbyshire.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a><a name="0707249000080"></a>There really is a material difference between involvement and consultation; that difference can most easily be described in terms of the before and after duties. The before duty is about the NHS having a dialogue with patients and the public when proposals are first being formulated. &#147;Involvement&#148; is the word that describes how patients and the public develop ideas as equal partners with the NHS. Consultation&#151;the after duty&#151;is what happens when that initial planning stage is over. It is about giving people the opportunity to comment on plans that have already been formulated.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a><a name="0707249000081"></a>I think that we all understand the difference between the two processes. To take an example, involvement in a review of a service for older people would include setting the review&#146;s terms of reference and suggesting what extra services might be needed so they could be considered as the review rolled out. Consultation on such a review would mean commenting afterwards on a set of fully formed proposals. There is a potential source of confusion here because commenting afterwards is provided for already in Section 7 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 and its accompanying regulations. This is the section now translated into the 2006 NHS Act, which obliges NHS bodies to consult the local overview and scrutiny committee on developments and variations in services. It is true that the Section 7 duty applies to substantial variations and developments in services, whereas Section 11 applies much more generally, but it is most confusing to have &#147;consult&#148; in both contexts. If it is intended to mean the same thing in both cases, it seems rather pointless&#151;because, if people have been consulted about a substantial variation as it has developed, what on earth is the point of consulting them again after their views have been taken account of? If, on the other hand, it is intended that in Clause 232 &#147;consult&#148; should in practice mean &#147;involve&#148;, surely that is the word that should be brought back into the drafting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"></a><a name="0707249000082"></a>Why has the change been made? I am certainly not clear about it&#151;and, as I have said, it is a change that is likely to generate confusion in all quarters.</p>

<a name="70723-0019.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a><a name="0707249000083"></a>The point of Amendment No. 242ZA is to widen the definition of those who should be consulted to those members of the public who may not be direct users of services but who nevertheless have an interest in them. This might, for example, include parents of children who are users or friends and carers of people with mental health problems. In fact, it could include anyone with an interest in improving care services, which is surely what we would expect to happen if, to take a typical case, primary care services were being reconfigured in a particular area. It is not just the users of those services who have an interest in what is decided but a much wider group of people, including those whom those services are not properly reaching. I beg to move.</p>

I shall do my best, but I fear that we may need another round of letters. Amendment No. 242ZA seeks to ensure that the duty on NHS bodies to consult, which is set out in Clause 232, is a duty to consult not only users of services but the public in general, as he explained. That is, however, unnecessary, as this is already captured by new subsection (1F) in Clause 232, which defines a &#147;user&#148; of health services as,</p>
<ul><a name="0707249000103"></a>&#147;someone to whom those services are being or may be provided&#148;. </ul>

<p><a name="stpa_516"></a><a name="0707249000085"></a>On Amendment No. 242A, I am not sure I can help the noble Earl. I am not at all surprised that he raises this point and I am very interested in the points he makes. This amendment seeks to retain the original wording of Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, which has since become Section 242 of the consolidated NHS Act 2006, which gives NHS bodies a duty to involve and consult patients and the public. On the noble Earl&#146;s analysis, I can confirm that during a judicial review into Section 11 in north-east Derbyshire, the judge found it difficult to perceive any real difference between &#147;involve&#148; and &#147;consult&#148;. We have taken this on board and have revised the section, not to reduce the requirement but rather to clarify our expectations of the NHS. We have retained &#147;consult&#148; because it fully reflects what we want the NHS to do, which is to seek the views of patients and the public in the planning of the provision of services and in developments of proposals, and to ensure that people are consulted on decisions affecting the operation of services. I am happy to write to noble Lords explaining the legal basis for the use of &#147;consult&#148;, and demonstrate that this fully covers all the activities that are described in the old Section 242 under &#147;involve and consult&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_517"></a><a name="0707249000086"></a>I think this is a good time to mention one of the ways we are strengthening the duty of consultation.

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a><a name="0707249000087"></a>The guidance will set out clearly examples of when it is appropriate to consult under Section 242 and what form that consultation should take. This will clarify what the expectations are for NHS organisations to comply with their duties and perform better user engagement. The work to deliver the guidance to Section 242 will cover a range of stakeholder consultations and will include regional road shows and reference group workshops. That engagement activity will include input into the early drafts of the guidance and the testing of the text as it develops. The Department of Health is very confident that the statutory guidance will go a long way to support more effective involvement and consultation. With an undertaking to write further, I hope that at this stage the noble Earl will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

Some of her latter remarks on Amendment No. 242A were rather like dancing on the head of a pin.

I would like, first, to direct to the Minister&#146;s attention to the regulations made under Section 7 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001. These refer to when an NHS body is thinking about a substantial development of local health services or a substantial variation in the provision of a service, and provides that it must in those circumstances consult the overview and scrutiny committee of a local authority. Specifically, it says that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="07072412000046"></a>&#147;Where a local NHS body has under consideration any proposal for a substantial development of the health service in the area off a local authority, or for a substantial variation in the provision of such service, it shall consult the overview and scrutiny committee of that authority&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70723-0020.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a><a name="07072412000007"></a>Let us take an example. There is, let us imagine, a proposal to develop renal services in a local authority area. Even if the proposal is not substantial or significant, under new Section 1B(a) of the Bill, planning to address it will still require consultation with patients. If it leads to proposals that are significant&#151;that is,  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_678"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 678</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>having a substantial impact on delivery of services&#151;it will require consultation under new Section 1B(b). If it starts to involve a substantial development or substantial variation, it will require public consultation with the overview and scrutiny committee under Section 7 of the Health and Social Care Act.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a><a name="07072412000008"></a>The first question is: at what point during the consideration of this proposal on renal services does Section 7 kick in? The answer has to be: as soon as it is understood that the proposal is for a substantial development or variation in the provision of a service. But what does that mean? In the context of Section 7 of the Health and Social Care Act, case law has helped to define what is meant by &#147;substantial&#148; variation and development. On the one hand, there is case law, and on the other, with the passing of this Bill, there will be statute law. As a result, we potentially have two different definitions to wrestle with: &#147;substantial&#148; as understood in the light of existing case law; and &#147;significant&#148; contained in Clause 232. We could, therefore, have a situation where it is considered that a change proposal or an operational decision is not going to have substantial impact on the delivery of services, but where nevertheless two apparently competing definitions come into play. One may dictate, under new Section 1B(b) and (c) that consultation with patients is not required and the other may dictate that consultation with the overview and scrutiny committee is required. At the very least, the situation is fiendishly complicated. It will lead to all sorts of confusion in the NHS and among LINks members&#151;confusion which is likely only to be settled by a court of law. I really would like the Minister to explain how she envisages all that working.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a><a name="07072412000009"></a>Setting that confusion to one side for the moment, what is wrong with the insertion of &#147;significant&#148;? In brief, it is that it will constrain dialogue between the health service and local communities in an unhelpful way. We surely want a grown-up relationship between both parties. We want mutual understanding and the kind of embedded public involvement recommended in the report of the Bristol inquiry. The insertion of &#147;significant&#148; is detrimental to that.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a><a name="07072412000010"></a>On Amendment No. 242D, there may be an argument for excluding operational decisions that are not significant. However, I have to ask the Minister where the evidence is that this has been a problem in the four or five years since the Health and Social Care Act came into force. I am not aware that it has been a problem; on the contrary, it seems likely that a better understanding of the operational difficulties of the NHS would make public expectations more realistic. In the absence of such evidence, it would seem foolish to dispense with the only means that the NHS and the public have to sit down together and solve the problems of the NHS in a grown-up way. Constraining that dialogue stifles the sort of relationship that I have just referred to and is counterproductive. I beg to move.</p>

However, I refer the Minister to the views of Candy Morris, of the South East Coast Strategic Health Authority, and Richard Stein, a lawyer, in their evidence to the Health Select Committee in the other place. Both argued that there was no need to amend the law relating to the duty to consult, because if the Department of Health approached that in the right spirit, it would work fine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_526"></a><a name="07072412000012"></a>The noble Earl is saying that we need to approach this in the right spirit and in a grown-up way. Putting in &#147;significant&#148; would raise all sorts of questions about who decides what is significant&#151;is this change or that change significant? That is not a grown-up way of proceeding. All of us in the Committee take this matter seriously and I hope that we will get some considerable comfort from the Minister.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a><a name="07072412000015"></a>Section 242 of the NHS Act, as it stands, is a wide-ranging duty and currently provides no sense of scale to enable NHS bodies to apply the duty meaningfully. Furthermore, without some kind of threshold, that duty has the potential to bring about that often-heard complaint of consultation fatigue. It is with a view to that challenge that the word &#147;significant&#148; has been introduced. By inserting a threshold, we are aiming to ensure that consultation under Section 242 for English bodies is fulfilled when there is a change that has a substantial impact on the range of services and the manner of their delivery. Without these thresholds, NHS bodies would have to consult patients and the public on even the most minor changes. However, I have heard very clearly the points made around the Chamber and, as I have said, we would like to consider further these amendments and remit further before Report.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, said, this whole issue is about approaching the involvement and consultation exercise in the right spirit and in a real sense, the way that the Government have amended Section 11 is missing the point of patient and public involvement. If the dialogue between local communities and health and social care providers is as it should be, there will be a greater understanding of the constraints under which such services operate&#151;a point made by Wanless in his report&#151;and therefore much more realistic demands from the public. If that relationship is mature, you will not get the NHS overburdened by excessive amounts

<p><a name="stpa_532"></a><a name="07072412000022"></a>The noble Earl said: I will speak also to the other amendments in this group, Amendments Nos. 242H, 242HA and 242J. In this final group of amendments we have reached Clause 233, which relates to PCTs and the reports that they are to be required to make on any consultations that they may have carried out. I begin with a very simple issue flagged up in Amendment No. 242G. What do the Government mean by consultation? Consultation in the minds of most of us is a public process. If we take the Bill as it is, a PCT might be allowed to suppose that it could confine its consultations to an internal audience, merely sounding out the views of trusts, GPs or local authorities. That kind of narrow exercise would not meet most people&#146;s ideas of a proper consultation. I think the Bill needs to be clearer about this.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a><a name="07072412000023"></a>In Amendment No. 242HA, I am raising another issue. I must apologise to the Committee that the amendment is rather clumsily shoehorned into Clause 233 in this fashion. I should have taken the time to compose a completely separate new clause to deal with the point, which is to ask the Minister why, if PCTs have a duty to report on consultations, no corresponding duty is placed on strategic health authorities. Strategic health authorities, as we know, are directly responsible for commissioning a range of services, not least specialist and tertiary services. A duty to consult is quite rightly imposed on them in Clause 232. Why should they not have to account for such consultations in a transparent and public way exactly as PCTs will have to do?</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a><a name="07072412000024"></a>Finally, in Amendments Nos. 242H and 242J, I want to flag up a particularly serious concern about the kind of commissioning that may or may not be covered by this clause. In subsection (3)(e), the Secretary of State is given a power to define what counts as a commissioning decision and he can do so by using his powers of direction. I worry about this on several levels. First, the Secretary of State can act without any public consultation and without the discipline of any parliamentary process. Secondly, there is a huge potential here to erode the accountability of the NHS to the public over a period. What is the Minister&#146;s response to that and in what way do the Government intend this power of direction to be used? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_255"></a>
<a name="07072412000025"></a><b><a name="70723-0020.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07072412000056"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> Amendment No. 242G seeks to make it explicit that the duty on PCTs to report on consultation should relate specifically to consultation with the public. I shall deal with that first. I can see that this amendment is a genuine attempt to clarify the position. However, it inadvertently narrows what the Bill provides. Our intention is that consultation should relate to consultation of the public  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_681"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column 681</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but it also relates to other groups, including stakeholders and staff. I do not see the need to prescribe so explicitly that it should be public consultation and I therefore hope that the amendment will not be pressed.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a><a name="07072412000026"></a>I shall offer some words of explanation about Amendments Nos. 242H and 242J. As Clause 233 (3) makes clear, we wish to provide PCTs with some explicit requirements about matters relating to the new duty to report on consultation. The noble Earl asked about direction-making powers. The direction-making power that is identified in the amendment enables the Secretary of State to set out what kind of commissioning decisions are appropriate for the report. That is a question of reporting rather than what constitutes a commissioning decision.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a><a name="07072412000027"></a>In every year a PCT will make hundreds of commissioning decisions about local services. We clearly do not want to create a duty that places by default such a heavy burden of reporting that it prevents a PCT doing its job effectively. However, we want to ensure that key decisions about, for example, the prioritisation of resources across the whole population of a PCT area, or how services per se are configured in the area, certainly should be reported upon.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a><a name="07072412000028"></a>We think that directions are the right vehicle for setting out these requirements, backed up by guidance. The guidance, which is part of the same package to which I referred in an earlier debate, is currently being prepared and itself will be a product of wide ranging involvement and consultation.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a><a name="07072412000029"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 242HA, which proposes to place a duty on strategic health authorities to report on their compliance with the Section 242 duty to consult and to report on what influence people&#146;s views have had on decisions. Perhaps I should remind noble Lords that SHAs are not service providers or commissioners; they are the organisations that are responsible for the performance management of local NHS organisations and are not responsible themselves for services. Bearing that in mind, it will be the SHA that will be looking to see that PCTs and trusts have complied appropriately with the requirements of Section 242 rather than fulfilling it itself.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a><a name="07072412000030"></a>We have put the duty to report firmly on the PCT specifically because it is the PCT that controls the vast majority of money in the NHS and which makes decisions about the use of resources and how that affects the way in which a specific population receives its health services. It is the relationship between the PCT and the population whom it serves that needs to be developed and supported.</p>

<a name="70723-0020.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a><a name="07072412000031"></a>PCTs need to be more open and accountable to local people and the duty to report on consultations is a tangible way in which PCTs can demonstrate that what they are doing is in the best interests of local

Strategic health authorities have a different role altogether. Although they are listed in the consultation requirements of Section 242&#151;it was Section 11&#151;it does not impact on them as they are not directly responsible for the planning or provision of services.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000009"></a>I remind the Committee that on the first day in Grand Committee we discussed assault, why it was necessary to have a separate offence of assaulting an immigration officer and whether this clause would come into force at the same time as Section 281 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Minister said in response to that amendment that the penalty of 51 weeks would indeed apply from the date that Section 281 comes into force, as Clause 21(5) provides, but he said that the offence itself would continue to apply until then. Clause 21 comes into force only in accordance with an order made by the Secretary of State, not when the Act itself comes into force, so for the time being assaults on immigration officers will continue to be dealt with under the existing law.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000010"></a>In his letter of 5 July, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that no separate statistics were held on these offences, but that in 2004-05 there were 28 assaults on BIA staff altogether. It was a little surprising that the Minister was unable to give a breakdown, because for all we know those assaults could have been against other staff working in the IRCs, Communications House and the AIT, for example, and if that appeared to be a problem there could have been an argument for widening the offence to assault on any employee of the BIA rather than immigration officers only. Perhaps when he replies the Minister will say why it was thought fit to confine this offence to assaults on immigration officers and not extend it to the rest of the BIA staff.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000011"></a>The agency has around 17,200 staff in the UK, including agency, casual staff and consultants, and the Home Office has no idea whether immigration officers are particularly vulnerable compared with all those other people. If the Minister cannot say anything at all about the circumstances of the assaults that have taken place on immigration officers, then equally the Government have no justification for  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>creating the new offence in this clause. It could be that in a subset of the 28 cases where the CPS decided to prosecute, common assault was the charge normally used, and that no problems had arisen with that. However, we shall never know because the noble Lord does not have that sort of information.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000012"></a>If there were more serious cases, where actual bodily harm was inflicted on the officer concerned, this clause would not have come into play in any case because the offender would be charged under Section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. It would be useful to know how many of the 28 cases that the Minister mentioned in his letter led to this or some more serious charge. Perhaps he can tell us. In the cases in which the charge was common assault contrary to Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, we need to know what difficulties arose because the officer or one of her colleagues could not arrest the offender, not having the power of arrest in Clause 22. In cases of assault where no police officer was in the vicinity and the attacker absconded before the police were summoned, surely that problem would be solved by the power of detention in Clause 2. We still do not see the justification for creating this new offence, and I am afraid that nothing that the Minister said in Committee or in his letter has dispelled our concern.</p>

<p><a name="07072316000013"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07072316000076"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I fail to see why such assaults on immigration officers could not be dealt with under normal criminal law. Surely any court would take into account the fact that the assault was on an immigration officer and would treat that as an aggravating factor.</p>

<p><a name="07072316000014"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07072316000077"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> At present, there is no specific offence of assaulting an immigration officer. Assaults on immigration officers from members of the public are charged under the offences applicable to a physical attack, and the power of arrest would lie with a police constable in the usual way. This is in contrast to the other public servants who exercise similar&#151;and, one must recognise, coercive&#151;powers, such as officers from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the police. The key motivation for taking this power is to provide immigration officers with the tools necessary to enable them to take the initiative and to deal with incidents of assault as they arise. This is wholly consistent with our commitment to enhancing the powers of our border services to strengthen inter-agency working.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000015"></a>The Government believe that it is important to give appropriate protection to agents of the state who exercise coercive powers in their front-line role to protect the public. The exercise of powers of arrest and the use of force mark out immigration, Revenue and Customs, and police officers from other government employees. A key aim of the border management programme is to enhance joint working between the border agencies to create the more effective, efficient and flexible border staff that the public expect. In this, it is important that we mirror for immigration officers the protection already afforded to the officers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and police colleagues. As with other offences in immigration legislation where a power of

Clause 22 creates this power of arrest. This power should exist for the same reasons why we already provide immigration officers with powers of arrest in other areas. To rely on a police officer in such circumstances undermines the benefits of ensuring that each agency can prioritise resources that will otherwise be delivered by introducing the primary intervention capability. Moreover, enabling immigration officers to arrest individuals who commit or attempt to commit an offence of assault against a colleague will ensure that we have the means to deal immediately with those who threaten the safety of front-line immigration officers.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000016"></a>This is a sensible power and provision, and I do not quite understand the problem that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has with it. Thankfully, there are not too many assaults on our immigration staff. However, those who assault them should be treated appropriately, and giving immigration staff these powers will enable them to deal with assaults much more easily. This is a sensible measure, as I said, and I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his objection to the clause.</p>

I cannot say that I am satisfied with the Minister&#146;s reply. No one is arguing about whether there should be charges made against someone who assaults a front-line officer, whether that be an immigration officer, a customs officer or a member of the police force. Nor are we arguing about the penalties, because the existing penalty for each of those offences is six months, and when Section 281 comes into force, that will be changed to 51 weeks, as we have discussed.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000018"></a>There is no question but that where people commit criminal offences against front-line workers, they should be charged, they should be brought before the courts and they should be given the same penalty, whichever service the assaulted person belongs to. We are arguing about whether there needs to be a separate charge relating to immigration officers in the Bill or whether the existing procedures work perfectly satisfactorily, and particularly whether they will work satisfactorily once the immigration officers have the power to detain, which they will have under the Bill. The noble Lord cannot even tell me whether there is any problem with people absconding at the moment in cases where someone commits an assault on an immigration officer and, because he does not at present have the power to detain, by the time a police officer is called to attend the scene the offender has already vanished into the crowds.</p>

<p><a name="07072316000019"></a>We have no breakdown whatever of the 28 cases that the noble Lord gave in his letter, whether they are assaults against a person in the front line, as he puts it, or against personnel working in immigration removal centres or some other part of the BIA. The noble Lord did not even bother to address the question that I put to him of why there should be a particular offence relating to immigration officers and

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000032"></a>The noble Lord said: I have already said on a previous amendment that there are things in the Bill that the Joint Committee on Human Rights positively welcomed. We certainly welcomed the Bill&#146;s extension of the scope of the existing trafficking offences, which implements one of the proposals in the Government&#146;s UK action plan on tackling human trafficking. However, we were disappointed that the opportunity had not been taken to introduce more effective protection for the victims of trafficking.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000033"></a>In our recent report on trafficking, we concluded that the current level of protection provided to victims is far from adequate from a human rights perspective. The committee expressed its appreciation to the Government for their positive response to the committee&#146;s recommendation to sign the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking and publication of the UK plan on trafficking. However, we remain deeply concerned at the delay in ratification and had a rather intense discussion on this matter with Mr Vernon Coaker only last week.</p>

<p><a name="07072316000034"></a>We thought it important that our recommendations should be considered as a whole and not cherry-picked. We made a number of recommendations about improving the legislative framework for protection and I should like to indicate some of them. In particular we recommended that the Bill should be amended to improve protection by providing that, where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person is a victim of trafficking, that person shall not be removed from the United  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Kingdom until the process for identifying whether he or she is such a victim is complete. That seems only reasonable. Why undertake the process if there are doubts? Obviously doubts should be resolved before action is taken.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000035"></a>A recovery and reflection period of three months should be granted to a person who has been identified as a victim during which time no immigration enforcement measures should be taken against them. It is difficult to imagine the trauma that victims of trafficking may have been through. In taking evidence and considering these matters we were repeatedly struck that too often the assumption was to treat them as part of the immigration problem and only subsequently as victims. After the psychological damage that may have been done to them, it is important that they should have a period in which they can come to a sensible and rational decision about what they want to do. Another proposal was that renewable residence permits of up to six months&#146; duration should be granted to victims of trafficking.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000036"></a>As the Committee knows, I am a very committed member of that Joint Committee. I do not much see the point of us acquiring the sort of role of a Greek chorus, wringing our hands and wishing things were otherwise and describing the horrible things that are happening off stage. If we feel these things, those of us who find ourselves with an opportunity like this should pursue them, which is why I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07072316000037"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07072316000080"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I pay tribute again to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, on his remarkably assiduous work on the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the way in which he has pursued many of the issues on which it has made recommendations in Grand Committee. It is very useful that we have had that voice raised periodically throughout these proceedings. We also had a useful debate on trafficking initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, on 27 June in which, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has pointed out, the House gave a general welcome to the Government&#146;s signature of the Council of Europe convention, to their production of the UK action plan on human trafficking and to the establishment of the UK Human Trafficking Centre and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, all of which are very useful measures that should help us to make a real impact on this wicked phenomenon of trafficking.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000038"></a>As often happens, in that debate far more points were raised than the Minister was able to cover in his response. I think that I am right in saying that we still look forward to his promised letter following up all those points, although we understand that, as he has to cope single-handedly with all the Home Office work, including this Bill, it is not easy for him to keep up with that correspondence.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000039"></a>Article 13 of the Council of Europe convention stipulates a minimum of 30 days for recovery and reflection, but the JCHR heard evidence&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has just told us&#151;suggesting that three months would be more appropriate. The impact on victims can be devastating, resulting in a variety of physical, psychological and emotional problems, as the UK action plan emphasises. The experience of women referred to the Poppy Project, whose needs  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC120"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were culturally diverse as well as varying widely according to their particular experience, seems to indicate that a more flexible approach is required, covering not only the immediate assistance to be provided but also the range of support and resettlement services needed by the women given leave to remain. The action plan calls for, among other things, the establishment of a multi-agency group to review victim-centred trafficking measures. We would like to see the more radical and comprehensive programme that will emerge from the trafficking centre and the NGO advisory group&#146;s recommendations, which will address three areas: better identification and referral procedures, enhanced support and rights for adult victims, and their reintegration and resettlement.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000040"></a>With regard to children, in previous debates we asked a number of questions and had answers to many of them in the Minister&#146;s letter of 19 July. It is apparent that, as a result of the global visa regulations introduced in February 2006, the number of UASC entering the country is falling, and because every child subject to an entry clearance must be accompanied by what is called a &#147;vignette&#148;, on which is recorded the personal details of the child and of the person with whom the child is supposed to be travelling&#151;or, in the case of an unaccompanied child, of the UK sponsor&#151;the opportunities for trafficking have, we hope, already been reduced. However, where there is a discrepancy between the information on the vignette and the actual details of the child or sponsor, the possibility of trafficking should be flagged up. I asked whether a central record was kept of the discrepancies and the action taken to follow them up. Having been unable to find any reference to it on the web, I also asked about the best practice code on the carriage of minors which the action plan said was to be published in May. I asked whether, in the event of any suspicion arising, the child and the adult sponsor would be interviewed separately. The Minister&#146;s letter of 19 July was very long&#151;in fact I think it was something of a record at nine pages. We are grateful to him for all the information that he has provided, but I wonder whether he could check it again and ensure that those questions were answered. On a quick skim, I think that they may not have been covered.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000041"></a>The arrangements for protection of child victims of trafficking are, of course, different from those for adults. They would be in no danger of removal as illegal entrants because all children, trafficked or not, are given &#147;discretionary leave&#148; under APU Notice 3/2007, to the age of 17 and a half since March, so they would have no need of the first leg of this amendment. Once identified as trafficked, a child must be provided with care and protection under the Children Act 1989 and equivalent legislation in Scotland. The action plan promises that national best practice guidance will be issued to professionals on how to provide support for trafficked children, supplementing the DfES publication <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>, published in April 2006. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell the Committee when this guidance is to be published.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000042"></a>I have every sympathy with the thinking behind this amendment, but I wonder if the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and others may think that we should  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC121"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>await the revised version of the action plan, following the Government&#146;s consideration of the 200-odd responses to the consultation on the plan, to see how far it meets the needs of victims of trafficking&#151;not just for recovery and reflection, but for their care, rehabilitation and resettlement. It would be useful if the amended action plan could be published before Report so that the House could then consider, in the light of all that work, whether any legislative changes need to be inserted into the Bill.</p>

I also reinforce the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord Avebury that the Government could implement the report on the action plan&#151;the valuation&#151;when we discuss this early in October on Report. I feel fairly optimistic for once that the Government have a heart and that that heart will include some reference to trafficking. Will it be in Amendment No. 51, which I prefer because it is far fuller and gives greater guidance, or even in Amendment No. 65? Not to implement it would be in total contravention of our signing of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. We cannot do something in that direction one day and refuse to implement it the next. Without saying anything further, I hope that my optimistic heart will be reflected in the Minister&#146;s answer and in the final Bill which is before us in October.</p>

I shall look at it item by item. I suggest that subsection (5) is of crucial importance, come what may. I have reasons for saying that, the principal one being that the process of dealing with a probably trafficked person will be vitiated. The person will be sent perhaps to their country of origin, or perhaps somewhere else, and will be wide open to being retrafficked. They will be put into an extremely vulnerable situation. I hope that the Government will take that point very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="07072316000047"></a>Subsection (6) brings us to the much-debated pause of time for reflection and recovery. Various Ministers over the years have said that if we legislated for such a pause, it would be a major incentive to traffickers to bring in more people. That is simply an assertion; no evidence has ever been given to support that argument. Even if the Government will not

<p><a name="07072316000048"></a>I am glad to say that I have received a letter today from Mr Kevin Brennan, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Children, Schools and Families, who said that the Government intend to produce,</p>
<ul><a name="07072316000071"></a>&#147;revised statutory guidance concerning children missing from care&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072316000065"></a>Children who get into care and then go missing are a just a small subsection of the whole range of trafficked people, even of the variety of trafficked children, but they are the ones that we should be most concerned about because of the reasons why they go missing. It is widely thought and perhaps generally acknowledged that it happens because someone is waiting to take them away and abuse them, exploit them or put them into sexual slavery or some other fate of that kind. Statutory guidance alone is not enough; we need more positive action.</p>

I cannot remember the details and do not have my notes with me, but she was given a prison sentence of some months because she did not have adequate papers. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, will recall the case. I would be grateful if the Minister could write to me to reassure me that there are measures to ensure that mitigating circumstances are taken fully into account in proceedings against individuals with inadequate papers. Although that was only one case, there was general concern that the measures that have understandably been taken to toughen up the immigration system were not being balanced against the consideration of cases involving people with particular vulnerabilities.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000050"></a>In our discussions on reporting restrictions for young people the Minister expressed his concern that young people are disappearing from care. That relates to the concern raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. Was the Minister thinking of distinguishing in the reporting restrictions between children held under Section 17 of the Children Act and those who have full-care status? I do not think that we explored that nuance and it would be interesting to have some information on it.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000052"></a>Noble Lords have tended to concentrate on the problems for children who have been trafficked. I understand that, and it is right that both amendments have been framed to cover all those who are victims of trafficking, regardless of age. If the person is a child it  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is easier to define him as a victim of trafficking because he can be said not to have had an element of choice about travelling. I appreciate that the Government have difficulty when dealing with older victims of trafficking because some of them may be victims who had no choice, whereas others may have exercised a choice to come to this country illegally and it is difficult to make sure that the distinction between the two is retained if they are to be treated differently.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000053"></a>There is also a third category, which I suspect arises frequently, comprising adults who choose to be trafficked to this country but the initial choice soon disappears because they are then subjected to duress. Whenever we discuss matters such as this we have to have in mind that, unless one has full information, it is difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis who is a victim of trafficking and who may not be. It is therefore difficult to make provision in the Bill to protect victims of trafficking. However, just because something is difficult, that does not mean that it is not worth trying to get it. I have a lot of sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. It would be strange if I did not because it is very similar to an amendment moved in another place by my honourable friend Mr Anthony Steen.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000054"></a>Although the Government have signed the Council of Europe convention, as other noble Lords said, which provides for renewable residency permits for the victims of trafficking, there is no structure in place within the UK for residency permits. As such, no alternative to temporary or permanent residency exists other than referring, for example, children through the asylum route. It is important here to look at the issue of children alone, an issue to which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, refers. It is important to know from the Government what they intend to do to remedy that issue. What other route will be provided? Although it will be appropriate for some trafficked children to be returned to their family or guardians in their country of origin, many trafficked children, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, will be living in fear of violence, sexual abuse and retrafficking if they are forced to return to their own community.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000055"></a>A couple of years ago I saw a very telling documentary screened at the UNICEF AGM of a young girl who had been trafficked and was in fear of being returned to her community but who had been resettled with the assistance of UNICEF and provided with a trade. It would have been extremely dangerous for her to return to her country. We have to bear such cases in mind. ECPAT says that it has regularly seen trafficked children&#146;s appeals statements being rejected and claims refused in this country because of a basic lack of awareness and concern about human trafficking from both BIA&#151;then IND&#151;staff and immigration solicitors. What are the Government doing to address that?</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000056"></a>I turn specifically to my Amendment No. 65, which looks at trafficking within the remit of what the chief inspector should be doing in the clauses at the end of the Bill. Clauses 47 to 55 are welcome additions to the Bill made by the Government in Committee in another place. In particular, Clause 47 requires the

The chief inspector will monitor and report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency. My amendment seeks to draw attention to the evil of people trafficking and covers all persons, not just children. It emphasises the fact that the chief inspector should report on the agency&#146;s treatment of those claimants and applicants who claim that they have been trafficked into the United Kingdom. I purposely shadowed the drafting used by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, because I think it important that we look at those who have made a claim that they are trafficked and not merely concentrate on those for whom it has been proved that they have been trafficked.</p>

<p><a name="07072316000057"></a>At an earlier stage I expressed my concern about the way in which the provisions of Clause 16 may have an impact on unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. My amendment goes wider. It asks the Government to put on the record what action they believe should be taken by the BIA to assist those who have been trafficked into this country, including those who claim that they have been trafficked, and including also those who try to give evidence against the traffickers and thereby risk their own lives for a second time in agreeing to give that evidence&#151;the first time being when they are brought into the country, often by the most hazardous means.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000058"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has been assiduous over the past years in drawing to the attention of the House the importance of assisting those who give evidence in these cases. He has argued repeatedly that they should not be removed from the United Kingdom until the process of identifying the traffickers and prosecuting them has been completed. It would be useful for the Committee to hear today what the Government&#146;s position is on that matter now. It is encompassed by my amendment, which would require the chief inspector to report on such matters. What assistance is given to all those who are prepared to give evidence? What improvements do the Government intend to introduce in the future, and when?</p>

<p><a name="07072316000059"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07072316000087"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I do not think that there is a great deal of difference between Members of the Committee on how we view this issue. In this year of all years it is very important that we try to make genuine progress to improve the work which we do within government on the issue of trafficking. Everyone accepts that trafficking is an evil and appalling crime that does terrible things to those caught up in its effect and its wake. No one really is at odds over the appalling nature of the crime. That makes my job the more difficult because I have to resist these amendments. On the plus side, it provides me with a helpful opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s approach on the issue more generally.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000060"></a>As well as using the Bill to strengthen existing trafficking offences, which has been acknowledged in Committee, the Government take very seriously their responsibilities towards victims of trafficking.

It is another step towards our main aim of making the UK a hostile place for traffickers.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000061"></a>The Home Office has developed an online checklist or toolkit&#151;call it what you wish&#151;aimed at practitioners to increase the awareness of trafficking. Training to identify and handle potential victims of trafficking has been provided throughout the regional enforcement offices. We have also provided staff with guidance on identifying victims of trafficking at the earliest stage. To support the identification of children in need, the Border and Immigration Agency has provided specialist training for about 600 operational members of staff nationwide. It is quite an extensive training programme. The message that children arriving in the United Kingdom may be here as a result of coercion or criminal activity, including trafficking, is central to the theme of the course.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000062"></a>When deciding whether to pursue the repatriation of an individual, very careful consideration is given to our obligations under immigration law and the Human Rights Act, including any risk that that individual might face on return and other reasons why they should be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom. The Government recognise that some individuals who have suffered exploitation at the hands of their traffickers will need time to recover and reflect on their position. Where appropriate, permission to remain in the UK may be granted indefinitely or on a limited basis. Each case is rightly assessed on its individual merits, and repatriation will be considered only where it is considered to be safe and the right thing to do.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000063"></a>On proposed new subsections (6) and (7) of Amendment No. 51, we have always said that we are wholly sympathetic to the objectives behind the Council of Europe convention. The convention will build on our strategy to combat human trafficking by providing minimum standards of protection and victim support. We have already done good work to develop an effective enforcement response to this horrendous crime by establishing the UK Human Trafficking Centre last year. That has been widely welcomed, including in the debate secured the other week by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh. The centre will become a central point for the development of police expertise and, more importantly in many respects, operational co-operation. We also continue to support adult victims of human trafficking through an investment of &#163;2.4 million in the Poppy Project, which provides shelter and support to victims who have been trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation. It will inevitably take some time before we move from signing the convention to it being ratified, and for good reasons.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07072316000064"></a>Amendments to primary and secondary legislation will be required, as will the development of guidance and the institution of new processes. It would be premature to accept Amendment No. 51 before we assess the best way of implementing all the requirements imposed on us by the convention. Amendment No. 65 would place a specific duty on the

Close attention to Clause 47(2) will pay dividends, because it is already drafted in such a way as to allow the chief inspector to give equal consideration to the treatment of claimants and applicants from all backgrounds. This includes those who may have been trafficked. The chief inspector will look at the processes by which decisions are made and how Border and Immigration Agency staff deal with people on a day-to-day basis. Where there is a specific area of concern, the Secretary of State will be able to ask the chief inspector to investigate and report on the matter.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000001"></a>As has been acknowledged in Committee, we have already made a considerable amount of progress. I accept that there is more to be done. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, argued passionately, as ever, and with great understanding that we need to ensure that protection is more adequate. We are all in agreement with that; I do not think that there is any dissent on that point. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, urged that we should consider the matter further when we have had the opportunity to look at the revised action plan. I cannot give a specific timetable on when we will have the opportunity to do that. I agree with the noble Lord that it would be useful if we could see some of that work completed by Report. I will ask officials whether that is possible. It is not that we are complacent or that we do not see the urgency of this&#151;I do, and the Government do. We want to ensure that we have adequate plans and measures in place so that we can give proper effect to the act of signing up to the convention.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000002"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked whether we were behind or ahead of European best practice. That is a difficult judgment to make. In some respects, the creation of the UK centre has been a big step forward, particularly on enforcement. We may well be in advance of other European states, but that is a hard judgment to make. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked me to check on a particular case. I will ask officials whether they have any understanding of the case that the noble Earl referred to; I cannot give an answer on it today.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000003"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07072329000151"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I apologise to the Minister for not having made myself clear. I did not really want the Minister to look at the particular case, rather the general principle of whether enforcement of statute is being sensitive enough about issues such as trafficking, which should be considered as mitigating circumstances in the application of those statutes.</p>

I believe that the person was charged with destruction of documents, which is a criminal offence that attracts a penalty of up to six months. It would be useful if the Government could declare that they do not wish people to be prosecuted for this offence when there is the slightest suspicion

It should be incorporated into instructions to the Crown Prosecution Service that, as a matter of public interest, which is one of the considerations that it has to take into account in deciding whether to prosecute, the question of whether a person may have been trafficked is a primary reason for not proceeding to prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000005"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07072329000153"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am not going to express a general view on this, because it would be unwise to do so. One has to look at these things on a case-by-case basis. Destruction of documents relating to someone&#146;s immigration status is a very serious criminal offence. Sometimes, it can be indicative of a general desire on the part of an individual to escape the effects of our legislation. It makes it much more difficult for immigration law enforcement purposes.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000006"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, referred to a debate that we had last week on reporting restrictions. We had a full-ish debate on that, and I am not going to go over the points that I rehearsed then. I made the point during that debate that there was a child protection benefit to the placing of reporting restrictions and there was a general encouragement to keep in contact with services as a product of that, which was accepted as being a beneficial move forward in some regard, even to critics of our approach.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000007"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made some useful points about retrafficking in particular, which I will come to in a moment. She also raised the issue of giving assistance in the production of evidence. I have made a poor note there, but will try to find an answer to that&#151;if not today, then certainly in correspondence.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked what efforts we were making to trace missing children. The Border and Immigration Agency is currently working to tighten up our policy and the process of reporting missing children. A working group has been set up, led by Kent Police, a procedure has been agreed to, and a pro forma has been developed to report potentially missing children. The noble Lord will have picked up on my concerns, and those of others, about children who go missing from care. I remain puzzled as to why and how that could happen. However, I know that it is difficult in those circumstances to provide absolutely as full a protection as the authorities charged with that responsibility would like.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000009"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made reference to victims being retrafficked. We recognise and acknowledge, as do other European states, that it is impossible to guarantee absolutely the safety of individuals on their return, but we can take steps to minimise some of the risks which may be present. In every case where we are considering the possibility of returning an individual, we will very carefully take into account our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and a full consideration of the case will include an examination of the assessment for that country. We look at evidential matters. To achieve that, we must work closely with NGOs such as the International Organisation for Migration, which runs a voluntary returns programme to offer those who return voluntarily the support they need to be safely reintegrated. Of course the Government provide  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reintegration assistance to that end as well. In addition, individuals accepted on to the Poppy Project scheme will have the option of returning to their country of origin and are given information and support about organisations in their country of origin which can assist in that process.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000010"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about how we identify victims of trafficking and how we can improve this. We have developed a best practice toolkit with NGOs which is now working to the benefit of immigration staff, police officers and other professionals who come into contact with victims. The important thing about that checklist/toolkit is that it aims to raise awareness of the difference between trafficking and smuggling. There is clearly a distinction there. I made reference earlier to training that was undertaken. That is clearly an important work in progress and something we need to do more of.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000011"></a>I hope that I have answered most of the points. This has been a very useful discussion and debate, building on the debate that we handily had the other week, instigated by the noble Lord, Lord Sheik. I had hoped that I was going to be able to say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that I had despatched the correspondence to which he referred. I thought that I had, but it is possible that I have not. I will go back and check my correspondence record again, redoubling my efforts. I know that there were a lot of issues which ran quite widely in that debate. I fully acknowledge that it is an important debate to fully respond to.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000012"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07072329000154"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> Before the noble Lord, Lord Judd, seeks to withdraw his amendment, perhaps I may first thank the Minister for the way in which he has dealt with my Amendment No. 65, and particularly for his offer to write to me on the assistance given to those who give evidence and how the Government seek to develop that in the future. That will be most useful.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000013"></a>The Minister directed me on Amendment No. 65, as I rather expected he should, by saying, &#147;Don&#146;t worry&#151;it&#146;s all covered by Clause 47(2)&#148;. Indeed, the general remit is given to the chief inspector. However, I was grateful for the way in which the Minister replied to the amendment. It is important to have on the record the fact that the Government see part of that remit as specifically the need to cover the way in which the BIA reacts to claims of trafficking and how those are processed.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000014"></a>There remains a difficulty that I shall return to when we reach Amendment No. 67&#151;that the Minister correctly said that the cases have to be viewed on a case-by-case basis. Under Clause 47, however, the chief inspector is not allowed to look at individual cases; he is looking at the general approach. I shall keep my powder dry for Amendment No. 67, because the issue goes rather wider than just this amendment.</p>

Something on the record could rebalance the matter slightly. I must find out more about that particular case and other similar cases, and I will contact the Minister in the Recess.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000016"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07072329000156"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I thank the Minister for his very courteous and characteristically full reply to this interesting debate. I thank also all those who participated. I hope that the Committee and the Minister will be bear with me if I try to comment fully on some of his comments.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000017"></a>I say at the outset that I appreciate the way in which the Minister has been with us for long hours over a number of sittings. He always listens very carefully and tries to respond thoroughly to the points made. There was a certain amount of controversy before we adopted a Grand Committee system. I did not share that feeling because, at its best, this system provides us with a good opportunity. If there is good will and genuineness on both sides, and before everyone gets into a too entrenched and overly defined position, the Minister is able to go away and genuinely think deeply about some of the arguments put forward. He can then come back with a considered and, we hope, constructive response at Report stage. In some ways, belatedly, this procedure covers what I would like to see far more of&#151;pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000018"></a>I very much appreciate the points made by other Members of the Committee. The Minister talked about how the Government&#146;s good will was well established by signing the convention and how ratification was another matter. Indeed, as I know Mr Vernon Coaker knows himself, the Government&#146;s position is well expressed in the view that we feel that ratification is appropriate only when we are sure that everything is in place to make it a real measure. That is an important argument which I for one take seriously. We do not want gestures that are quickly shown to be no more than that.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000019"></a>The process of getting things in place can, however, become terribly extended. I was a Member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe when we originally discussed the convention, and the anxiety was building up. I was very much identified with those who were pushing for the convention. I was always totally convinced that the United Kingdom would be in the vanguard of support for this measure. Indeed, I am reassured by repeated government statements, the terms of which show that the Government regard as reprehensible the whole business of trafficking. However, it was difficult to explain to colleagues and others in the Council of Europe why it took so long for the UK Government to reach the point of signing. Now there is just bewilderment at how long they are taking to ratify.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000020"></a>It would be helpful if the Government could at least establish a target date by which they intend to ratify. I point out that I was in government some years ago. That would give all involved a sense of discipline  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as regards getting the pieces in place and reviewing what has happened, and would give them a deadline against which to work. Otherwise, unintentionally, the psychology of institutions becomes a rationalisation process, which just means that delay goes on and on and on. Ministers should make it clear exactly when they want to ratify.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000021"></a>That brings me to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I assure him that the Joint Committee shares his anxieties. Our report stated that we were disappointed at the lack of a clear timetable for implementing the Government&#146;s action plan on trafficking and all the requirements of the convention against trafficking. We welcome the Minister&#146;s offer to provide us on Report with regular updates on the timetable and the Government&#146;s progress against that timetable. So there is a sort of undertaking by the Government which we need to encourage them to fulfil.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000022"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07072329000157"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> It was reinforced.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000024"></a>The observations of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, are always pertinent and important and I found them very helpful. She knows how passionate I am about children&#146;s issues. It is important to emphasise that children&#146;s issues have special dimensions which we must always have very much at the forefront of our minds. On her general point about the Government&#146;s dilemma, no one dismisses the fact that there may be a dilemma; I certainly do not. However, it is very complicated because often the original choice to come here illegally will have been part of the whole trafficking basis. Somebody will have put these people up to it knowing perfectly well that it will subsequently make them vulnerable with regard to what they want to do with them once they are here. Trafficking is a sinister business. We would be naïve not to recognise that very real possibility.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000025"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07072329000159"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Judd, has come to the end of his peroration but he makes an extremely important point, which I tried to get across in my opening remarks. I have in mind particularly children who are sent here by families who believe that they are trafficking them to a better life here, but are in fact exposing them to torture, degradation and abuse. We have to consider all the various aspects of this evil trade. The noble Lord is right to refer to that.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000026"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07072329000160"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that intervention. Of course, this applies also to adults. Whatever their position, and even if originally they made this choice themselves, in the name of humanity we must recognise that they have often been through a searing and deeply disturbing psychological experience. Therefore, they ought to be given time to reflect on their situation before final decisions are made and implemented. We do not say in the Joint Committee&#146;s report that there should not be deportations, but in the name of decency we are making a sensible suggestion and reinforcing what is in the conventions.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000027"></a>That covers most of the points that were made, to which I wanted to respond. I conclude by saying again that it would be good from every standpoint if the Government would introduce the self-discipline of a target date for ratification. In the mean time, for the obvious procedural reasons to which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has already referred, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000030"></a>Clause 31 [<I>Automatic deportation</I>]:</p>

</ul>
<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000032"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 31 provides for the deportation of a foreign criminal. In the debates on Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the expression,</p>
<ul><a name="07072329000138"></a>&#147;presumed to have been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07072329000119"></a>was defined for the purpose of excluding a person who came within the definition of a &#147;Serious criminal&#148; in the section heading. He was excluded from the protection of the refugee convention in accordance with Article 33. Although the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, proposed an amendment raising the threshold to 14 years, the House decided that two years was right. It would be useful to know how many such persons have been denied the right to appeal for asylum since February 2003 when this section came into force. Those persons have been liable to immediate deportation at the end of their sentences for more than four years, and presumably all of them will have been subject to deportation orders and will have been prohibited from appealing against the orders if the AIT agreed that the certificate issued by the Secretary of State properly claimed that the individual had been convicted of a particularly serious crime, as defined in Section 72(2) to (4) of the Act.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000033"></a>Section 72(4) also excludes from the protection of the refugee convention a person convicted of any one of 324 offences specified by the Secretary of State, irrespective of the sentence that has been imposed on that person, and even if the sentence is suspended. I should be grateful if the noble Lord would confirm that that is a fact. That provision is mirrored by Clause 31(3), so that a person who commits an offence in that list is both a &#147;foreign criminal&#148; and a &#147;serious criminal&#148;, but a person who commits some other offence only comes within both categories if he is sentenced to at least two years. If he is sentenced to less than 12 months, he is neither a foreign criminal nor a serious criminal. But if he is sentenced to at least 12 months but less than two years, he is a foreign criminal but not a serious criminal. This amendment aligns the definitions with one another. Of course, it does not prevent the Secretary of State making a deportation order against the person who is sentenced to between one and two years, but it gives him the discretion not to do so when the person qualifies for the protection of Article 33, even within the narrow compass of Section 72 of the 2002 Act.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000034"></a>We should note that in Clause 116 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, still to be considered by Parliament, there is yet another category of person labelled as a &#147;foreign criminal&#148;, but not identical with the &#147;foreign criminal&#148; defined in Clause 31.The definition is almost, but not quite, the same as that in Section 72 of the NIA Act 2002:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07072329000131"></a>&#147;A person ... presumed to have been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07072329000120"></a>called, as I said, a &#147;Serious criminal&#148; in the section heading.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000035"></a>The two variations in Clause 116 of the new Bill are that the person convicted of an offence specified by the Secretary of State must have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment, which presumably may be a suspended sentence, and an additional condition that Article 1F of the refugee convention, which excludes certain criminals from the protection of the convention, applies to him. If these variations are read back into Section 72 of the NIA Act and the term &#147;foreign criminal&#148; was then defined as a person coming within any of the resulting conditions common to the two measures, we could replace the term &#147;foreign criminal&#148; in Clause 31 with another expression such as &#147;deportable criminal&#148;. I respectfully suggest that otherwise there is going to be some confusion between these three pieces of legislation. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="07072329000139"></a>&#147;who is convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072329000121"></a>I suspect that that is going too wide. I am slightly surprised at the moderation of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in wanting to put in only two years; I think a case could be made out for putting in five years. I very recently came across a case of an asylum seeker who had made the mistake of taking a job in this country, no doubt completely out of ignorance. For that he was convicted and served a prison sentence&#151;I am not sure how long&#151;and was then detained presumably in preparation for deportation. The commission of technical offences should not be a kind of fast-track to deportation. I hope that the Government will have second thoughts about this.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000038"></a>The definition of a foreign criminal in Clause 31 of the Bill means that automatic deportation will apply to foreign nationals who have been sentenced to imprisonment for either a period of 12 months or more or any length of time for an offence listed on the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Specification of Particularly Serious Crimes) Order 2004. Amendment No. 52 would alter the first of those conditions, allowing for the automatic deportation of those sentenced to two years or more in prison&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, described as a rather moderate attempt to amend our policy intent. Although I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for providing this opportunity to debate what the threshold for automatic deportation should be, I profoundly disagree with him.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000039"></a>To look at this issue we need to begin by considering what we are trying to achieve and then consider how the criteria we have chosen are designed to meet these aims. The Government&#146;s objectives in the automatic deportation provisions are primarily twofold: to protect the United Kingdom public from harm from foreign criminals and to send out a message that foreign criminals who abuse the United Kingdom&#146;s hospitality are simply not welcome here.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000040"></a>I accept that this is a delicate matter and that the Government have a broader responsibility underpinning these aims. We must ensure that the effect of the legislation is proportionate and that the application of the measures will be just. We must find a balance. The first step towards finding that balance is to accept that being deported has a substantial impact on a person&#146;s life, and it would be wrong to apply the automatic deportation provisions to every foreign national convicted of a criminal offence. Such an approach would go far beyond protecting the British public from harm and would be disproportionate and unfair. However the argument for proportionality is not an argument for leniency; the provisions must still achieve their objectives.</p>
<h5><a name="07072329000147"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000041"></a>It was on this basis that the Government developed the policy. We set out to identify what we meant by serious criminality. We began with the first condition: that a person who has been imprisoned for 12 months should face deportation. The 12-month threshold was selected because, as I am sure that noble Lords will agree, the courts do not hand out 12-month sentences unless an offence is serious. It is also the threshold of criminality that the Border and Immigration Agency currently applies when determining whether to deport a foreign national.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000042"></a>This first condition goes a long way towards achieving each of the Government&#146;s aims. However, in setting this threshold, we recognised that it would not work in isolation. The serious nature of certain crimes means that if a person has been imprisoned for them, regardless of the length of his sentence, the perpetrator&#146;s presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good. It was on this basis that the second condition was included in the provisions. It ensures that serious criminal behaviour does not slip through the net. The list of crimes on the order made under Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which will be revised ahead of commencement, contains offences of a violent, sexual, terrorist, acquisitive or drug-related nature, along with other miscellaneous but no less serious offences. Together, I believe that the two conditions meet their objectives. First, they will help to protect the British public from foreign criminals who have been convicted of serious offences; and secondly they send out the message that serious criminality will not be tolerated in the UK.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000048"></a>The two conditions together meet their objectives. First, they will help to protect the British public, and secondly they will send out that important message. The provisions meet our underpinning duty to be proportionate and fair. They are aimed at, and will capture, serious offenders. While I respect the noble Lord&#146;s intention in tabling his amendment, the amendment would create an unwelcome gap in the implementation of the Government&#146;s policy and for that reason it is unacceptable. Examples of the sorts of offences that would not be subject to automatic deportation if we were to accept the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion of two years&#146; imprisonment as a threshold are the very serious offences under the Fraud Act 2006 such as fraud, deception, forgery and counterfeiting. In cases involving such offences, a person is sentenced to at least 12 months&#146; imprisonment but less than two years. Those sorts of offences would fall through the net, which would begin to undermine the effectiveness of the cover that we are trying to provide.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000049"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07072329000168"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I am very surprised to hear the Minister say that fraud and counterfeiting cannot attract a sentence of as much as two years. I would have thought that the maximum sentence must be considerably more than that for either of those offences. Other offences for which the maximum is very much greater include theft, for which the maximum is 10 years. Theft can be a fairly minor offence, but the maximum sentence obviously covers a whole range of conduct, including acts that are perfectly trivial and others that are very serious. Fraud and counterfeiting are similar. I would be very surprised if the maximum sentence did not allow for a wide variation in the acts that were brought before the courts. Some acts would justify a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000050"></a>I am also very surprised that the Minister did not address my main argument that there are now three separate definitions under Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</p>

If the noble Lord will indulge me for a moment, I am also conscious that I did not respond to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, when he asked whether failed asylum seekers found to be working in breach of conditions would be detained for deportation as foreigner criminals. The answer is no. Even if it was decided to prosecute the individual, the maximum sentence would be only six months. It is therefore probable that the individual whom the noble Lord might have had in mind would be detained for administrative removal under the terms of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Unlike deportation, an individual subject to administrative removal is not prohibited from returning to the UK if the appropriate entry clearance is obtained. I hope that that answers the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton.</p>

He said in the first part of his remarks that the Government had clearly defined what they meant by serious criminality. I challenge that definition because the words &#147;serious criminal&#148; are used in only one place in the legislation; namely, in the heading of Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Curiously enough, the section does not go on to define a serious criminal but speaks about a person,</p>
<ul><a name="07072329000140"></a>&#147;presumed to have been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072329000122"></a>When I thought carefully about this section, I could not for the life of me see why it did not define a serious criminal as a person who came within the provisions of subsections (2) to (4). If it did, one would be able to refer to a serious criminal in subsequent legislation. In fact, we are not able to do so because one would not want to use the very convoluted expression defined in subsection (2). But we have two definitions of a foreign criminal; that is, the definition in this Bill and the one in the Bill that I mentioned which is coming down the track. I sought in my amendment to align the definition of a foreign criminal as regards the sentencing with what we have already decided.</p>

It was chosen to align it with the provisions of Section 72 of the NIA Act 2002. The noble Lord looks pained, but I do not agree that this is a trivial matter. It would be helpful to the courts

<p><a name="07072329000058"></a>The noble Lord said: As drafted, this clause excludes the courts entirely from the process of automatic deportation except in the limited circumstances specified in Clause 34. We consider that while there may be a presumption that deportation of a foreign criminal, as defined, may be conducive to the public good for the purpose of Section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act, it should be for the court and not for the Home Secretary to make a recommendation for deportation on the basis of that presumption, as proposed under Amendment No. 53. Amendment No. 54 proposes that the Home Secretary should have regard to that recommendation unless, under Amendment No. 55, he decides that the deportation is not conducive to the public good.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000059"></a>While the majority of persons subject to the Clause 34 process ought to be deported, there will always be a few whose presence in the United Kingdom is conducive to the public good. I refer the Minister to Sakchai Makao, the young Thai national who had lived in Shetland for 13 years and represented the islands three times at athletic events but who was threatened with deportation after serving eight months of a 15-month sentence. My honourable friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07072329000133"></a>&#147;The decision to deport Sakchai should never have been made&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000060"></a>There will always be a small number of people, still with limited leave to remain after many years of living in the United Kingdom and contributing positively to their communities, who commit a one-off crime that attracts a sentence of a year or more. Some of these people would even be legitimate applicants for asylum, not covered by the restricted interpretation of Article 33, which we have just been discussing. We do not like the idea of automatic deportation or automatic penalties of any kind without judicial intervention. As my honourable friend the Member for Rochdale said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07072329000134"></a>&#147;We are having this debate about automatic deportation because last year the Home Office failed to review and carry out deportation orders on several criminals in the system.

I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response on why the Government think it better for there to be no flexibility in this matter. The amendments also raise an interesting point about why Clause 31 is entitled &#147;automatic deportation&#148; when there are still hoops that must be jumped through&#151;the Secretary of State must judge whether the person is able to claim protection under the convention and whether his or her life would be in danger if deportation goes ahead. There is also the possibility that the country of origin will not accept the person back. These points are not trivial and they pose serious problems for the effective implementation of this clause. What agreements have the Government managed to make with countries about the treatment of returned criminals? Have they moved any further on methods of establishing whether those agreements to protect the criminal from breaches of the convention are being kept?</p>

<p><a name="07072329000063"></a>We cannot support Amendments Nos. 54 and 55. We believe that involving the courts in this process would further delay an already slow process and would not add anything to the limited judgment that the Secretary of State is left to exercise.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000064"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07072329000175"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords who have contributed to this short debate. Clause 31(5) places an obligation on the Secretary of State to make a deportation order for foreign criminals who meet the threshold for criminality, save where one of the exceptions in Clause 32 applies. Taken together, Amendments Nos. 53 and 56 essentially eliminate that obligation. Amendment No. 53 removes the assertion that the deportation of a foreign criminal is conducive to the public good, replacing it with a mere presumption that it is. The noble Lord drew attention to a particular case to make his argument, and it is a fair point. Amendment No. 56 creates a duty actively to consider whether a foreign criminal&#146;s deportation is conducive to the public good.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000065"></a>The presumption in favour of deportation and the discretion to consider a case on its merits already exist. Clauses 31 to 38 add to the existing legal framework by creating certainty that criminality of a certain level will result in deportation. The Government recognise that in some instances deportation may not conform to our international obligations, for example under the European Convention on Human Rights or the refugee convention. It would not be in the public interest to deport a foreign criminal if his offending was due to  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC138"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mental illness or if one of the other exceptions in Clause 32 applied. However the number of those cases will be limited. In cases where an exception does not apply, deportation must be certain and swift. The provisions in Clauses 31 to 38 achieve those objectives. From the day he is convicted to the day of his release the foreign criminal and his victim will know that, subject only to one of the five exceptions, he will be deported with no scope for discretion to be applied. The noble Lord&#146;s amendments would hinder that. They would create an open-ended, ambiguously defined test which would ultimately be used by serious criminals as a means of frustrating deportation.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000066"></a>Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s obligation to make a deportation order in respect of foreign criminals who meet the threshold set out in Clause 31. They add nothing to the existing deportation arrangements in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1971. Sentencing judges already consider exercising their power to recommend deportation whenever they sentence a foreign national. Likewise, the Secretary of State already considers very seriously any recommendation put forward by a court. The amendments would do little more than create a statutory duty to perform a process which takes place now as a matter of course.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000067"></a>The Government believe in the value of an objective threshold for serious offending, which is set out in the Bill. We will continue to listen to the views of sentencing courts to capture extenuating features of offending behaviour below that threshold. This approach in respect of serious offending will allow for greater certainty for both the offender and the victim and will send out the message that serious criminality will not be tolerated. If the amendments were accepted, there would be no certainty over deportation. It would also send out the wrong message&#151;simply that offenders might face deportation. I do not believe that that would be satisfactory or desirable.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, made a case based on the example he gave, that there would always be instances when a foreign criminal&#146;s presence is conducive to the public good. We recognise that there may be such instances, and that when a person is exempt from an automatic deportation order, an exception can be made under clause 31, such as for Article 8 reasons. There is not an assumption that their deportation is conducive to the public good in those cases. It may be that a person has lived here for a long time and has family ties in the United Kingdom. However, those considerations will have to be balanced against the level of criminality. That consideration is very important and we have attempted to reflect that in our approach.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000070"></a>If the same circumstances arose under this Bill it would have been impossible for the Secretary of State to exercise his discretion in the young man&#146;s favour. In the future it will not even be necessary for someone to have been sentenced to imprisonment. As the Minister can confirm, if someone receives a suspended sentence&#151;presumably for a fairly minor offence, because the courts do not give out suspended sentences for the sorts of offences, such as drug dealing, that the noble Lord described a few minutes ago&#151;and he breaches the terms of the licence for some reason, that will immediately call into play the automatic deportation provisions of the clause. The absence of any discretion on the part of the Secretary of State to refrain from exercising deportation in any circumstances not covered by the exceptions is too restrictive and should be altered. I can see that we will get nowhere in the debate on this clause and that we will have to return to the point on Report. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000077"></a>The noble Lord said: I am immensely grateful to Save the Children Fund for having alerted me to the significance of this matter and for having argued its case with me so well. I am so impressed that there is a basic injustice here that I felt that I had no alternative but to table an amendment and share my concern with the Committee in the hope that the Minister would share that concern and, in the light of what I said previously, seek a way in which to respond.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000078"></a>Clause 31(2) and (3) mean that mandatory deportation would apply to those who have committed a less serious offence. The person would have had to have been sentenced to at least 12 months&#146; imprisonment or would have had to have committed an offence covered by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Specification of Particularly Serious Crimes) Order 2004. Crimes such as immigration offences, including entering the UK without a passport, would also be included. Surely we all realise that, for a child fleeing persecution&#151;it is not always a child&#151;entering the UK without a passport or with a false passport might be the only way out of a dangerous environment. Yet this might be difficult to prove. Other offences that would also be included in this provision are fly tipping and possessing cannabis for personal use.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000079"></a>It is particularly worrying, given the wide range of offences concerned, that Clause 32 provides for the automatic deportation of a person who committed an offence when he was a child. Clause 32 lists a number of exceptions where the Secretary of State may not   


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make a deportation order. However, the second exception, in Clause 32(3), provides for an exemption from Clauses 31 to 38 only if the person is under 18 when he was convicted. This means&#151;here we come to the rub of what seems to be a disturbing injustice&#151;that someone who commits an offence when they are under 18 but who is not convicted until after their 18th birthday would be eligible for automatic deportation under these new proposals.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000080"></a>The comments made by the Minister in Committee in the other place are certainly to be welcomed. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07072329000136"></a>&#147;If we are deporting children, we need to be satisfied that there are adequate protections in place in order to avoid deporting a vulnerable person&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="07072329000126"></a>and that the Government have,</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000082"></a>Save the Children and others recognise that the Government seek to address their obligations through exception 2. However, as the clause stands, they will not fulfil their obligations. It is likely to give protection only to younger children and will not guarantee protection to those aged 16 or over, given the likelihood of their reaching their 18th birthday before they are convicted.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000083"></a>I have been made aware that the Minister in another place said that it may be difficult to pin down the date of an offence and that the point of conviction provides clarity and certainty. However, other legislation refers to the age at which an offence was committed. For example, Section 229 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 uses the age at which an offence was committed to determine whether to take previous offences into account when sentencing. If the Government have included such a proviso in their previous legislation, why cannot they include a similar clause in this Bill?</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000084"></a>Save the Children gave an interesting illustration of the implications of this measure. A vulnerable 17 year-old girl is smuggled into the UK, six months before her 18th birthday and is subsequently convicted, under Section 2 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, of entering the United Kingdom without a passport. She receives a 12-month custodial sentence. However, before she is convicted, she turns 18 and becomes eligible for automatic deportation. Had she turned 18 after being convicted, she would not have been eligible for automatic deportation. This amendment seeks to remedy what seems to me to be a clear injustice. I beg to move.</p>

In deciding whether to apply exception 2, the date of the offence and not the date of the conviction should be relevant. If the person was a child at the time of the offence he should have the benefit of the exception, notwithstanding the fact that he became an

The objection to this provision&#151;mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Judd&#151;by the Minister, Mr Liam Byrne, when it was discussed on Report in another place, was that it is often very difficult to pin down the exact date of an offence, particularly in cases of drug dealing and sexual abuse, where the offences may be spread out over a considerable period of time.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000086"></a>If that is the sole argument against allowing somebody who committed an offence as a child to benefit from the exception, why not provide that where the exact date of the offence is not known, it should be taken be taken as the latest date on which the offence could have been committed? If the charge was that on a date between X and Y the defendant committed the offence, then Y would be taken as the actual date for the purpose of this clause. If the spirit of this amendment is acceptable to Ministers, it should not be impossible for the parliamentary draftsmen to produce a form of words that would deal with the matter in that way. Otherwise, Parliament would deprive children of the right that is supposedly conferred by the exception solely because of the length of time that the offence takes to be dealt with by the police, the CPS and the courts.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000087"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Judd, mentioned other statutory provisions that refer to the date of the offence, particularly Section 229 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, where the court is required to assess the dangerousness of an offender according to whether he was over or under the age of 18 at the time when he committed the offence. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us how the courts have dealt with that problem, on which there is no guidance in the National Probation Service&#146;s circular 18/2006 on the pre-sentence report framework that is to be adopted on the 2003 Act. No doubt the Minister will enlighten us when he comes to reply.</p>

I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Avebury. It brings me back to thinking about technical offences, which I mentioned on an earlier amendment. I remind the Committee that the UN Convention on Refugees clearly states that technical offences, such as travelling on false or forged documents, should not prevent consideration of a person&#146;s asylum claim. I hope that technical offences will not lead to automatic deportation. Can the Government put their hands on their hearts and say that none of the 320 offences listed somewhere are technical offences?</p>

During the previous day in Committee, we discussed how we establish the age of a youngster who can be assumed to be 18 years old. How certain is that assumption? People often come from places without birth certificates or documentation, and we could be committing a massive injustice if we assume the worst as far as age goes. We must always presume  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that a youngster was not of a certain age when an offence was committed. We discussed the difficulty of ascertaining a person&#146;s age. Even now, in the UK, people are asked to show ID because they may not look their age: they might look much younger or much older. We are uncertain about age. When I was a boy, the film categories were A, U and X. In order to get into an A film, you tried to look as old as you could, and you never got into an X film because you could never look quite that age. There was always uncertainty about age.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000090"></a>In parts of Asia and Africa, malnutrition and the ageing effect of poverty can often make age open to dispute. We know that half of applicants&#146; assumed ages were disputed in the UK. There are also cultural differences. The age of responsibility, of decision-making or of moral awareness might be more important that the physical age. In a place such as Zimbabwe, life expectancy is 34 years, whereas in Iran it is 71, and here it is about 77 or 78. Ages change in different places. I wish something other than the assumed anno domini age could be taken as the level with which we deal with these particular problems. I suggest that whenever we are imprecise or uncertain, we should take the kindly, compassionate way out and always presume in favour of the person who is supposed to have committed an offence, and never take the harsher way, which can result in tremendous injustice, as I said earlier.</p>

I think that I will disappoint him, but I doubt whether he would ever be surprised at that. I am unable to accept the amendment for the same reasons that my honourable friend in another place, Liam Byrne, gave during the Public Bill Committee on a very similar amendment.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000092"></a>The Government are clear that there must be certainty in the process, which is crucial to the effective administration of the provisions. I have heard what noble Lords have said, and I respect their views. But focusing on a foreign criminal&#146;s age at the time that they offended, rather than at the date of conviction, would reduce that certainty, because it is sometimes difficult to pin down exactly when a crime has taken place. It may have occurred over an extended period, which is particularly likely for some drug offences and perhaps for sex crimes. Or the victim may be unable to provide a precise date, as in some cases of child abuse. Accepting the amendment about when the offence took place and delays in decisions on whether automatic deportation should apply would not, I believe, be in the interests of justice. For those reasons, we cannot accept it.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000093"></a>Some questions and points were raised, to which I should try to respond. My noble friend Lord Judd asked whether illegal entry would attract automatic deportation. That is not the case. The maximum penalty for illegal entry is six months, and that offence is not on the Section 72 list. My noble friend also said that if the Government are deporting children, we must be satisfied that there are proper arrangements in place for their destination countries. I agree; the Government are at one with him. We would not seek to deport a person aged under 18 unless there were  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more than adequate reception arrangements awaiting their return. That would be our policy approach.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000094"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked whether any of the offences in the Section 72 order were technical immigration offences. The only immigration offences under that order are serious offences, attracting a maximum penalty of 14 years, such as facilitation and trafficking. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, as ever, was concerned about the relationship of this clause with age and age determination. The court will have been able to use the statutory procedure set out in Section 99(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. If necessary, the court will also have been  able to consider both domestic and foreign documentation. The noble Lord almost made a case for us having proper procedures, or procedures that were as rigorous as possible, in coming to a view about a person&#146;s age. We had that important debate last week. Anything that we can do to sharpen that up&#151;this goes back to the debate that we have had on a couple of occasions about using medical records, dental records, and so on&#151;we should do, to get a proper or as accurate an age determination as we can.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000095"></a>That probably covers all the points made. It is perhaps worth saying that when a person who is apparently under 18 is before the court, the court can make due inquiry as to their age and must take into account all evidence available to it. That is an important consideration. I hope that, having heard what I have to say, my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment, although he may be disappointed.</p>

He mentioned certainty twice. If the charge against a person is that on a date between X and Y he did such and such, the court has to be satisfied that the offence was committed between those two dates. That is the burden of proof of the prosecution. If the charge is that on a date between 1 January 2005 and 1 January 2006 someone committed a particular offence, the court not only has to be satisfied that the offence was committed, but that it was committed between those two dates. I was suggesting that, for the purposes of the amendment, you could have certainty if you took the latest of the dates as the date on which the offence was committed.</p>

I suggested that as a way around the uncertainty that was created for a particular class of offences as set out by the Minister in repeating more or less word for word what was said by his honourable friend Liam Byrne in another place. There is a solution to this, and I would be grateful if the Minister would consider it.</p>

My noble friend sometimes puts his friends in difficulty. He said that he suspected that I would not be surprised by his response. I am not sure what I am supposed to say to that. If I say that I am not surprised, that seems to me to be a rather sad reflection on the Government. The arguments that have been put forward are extremely cogent and telling, and if I therefore say that I am surprised, it is because I believe that the Government are open to reason; we are in a sorry plight if they are not. I really believe that the reason stands up.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000100"></a>My noble friend referred to views. The noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Hylton, others and I have reached conclusions on what we think should happen, but we are not dealing here with a view or a moral judgment; we are dealing with the reality of a contradiction within the process. My noble friend referred, as I did, to what the Minister said in the other place; that is the kind of argument that makes me cross. I could use stronger words. Even if my noble friend discounts the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for taking the later date&#151;which is a very convincing argument indeed&#151;he says that, because this might occur in some circumstances, even those for whom it is clearly not the case are lumped together with the exceptions, and so you justify the whole thing by one partial argument. That is not good enough when we are dealing with the rights and the position of children; it is just not good enough. Therefore, I say to my noble friend with all the feeling, passion and reason that I can muster that this is an injustice. If we are trying to win young people in this country to a respect for British justice and its consistency, this is the kind of obvious contradiction that could so easily be put right. Obstinacy is only going to play into the hands of those who want to generate cynicism about the processes of the law.</p>

I think that is what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, was saying. I dread extending proceedings on this, because I know that a snail is a Ferrari compared to us, but I feel this point is important. Might it possibly be that someone who has some form of mental illness but who is not subject to a restraining order wishes to be deported? Even though they might be subject to an exception or protection, they may not wish to have that protection.

The provisions appear to give rise to a risk of prolonged post-sentence immigration detention, which is potentially in breach of the right to liberty in Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Bill provides that a person who has already served a period of imprisonment may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State while the Secretary of State considers whether he must make an automatic deportation order and pending the making of such an order where he decides that such an order must be made. The Secretary of State has a wholly open-ended discretion as to the timing of such an order.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000112"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Prisons, in its work on foreign national prisoners, has found that a number of foreign nationals have been held in prison and immigration removal centres far past their sentence expiry date, awaiting a decision on whether they will be deported. Such prolonged post-sentence detention carries a high risk of breach of the right to liberty in the article to which I have referred. The committee felt that, to meet this point, the Bill should be amended to lay down a specific timeframe within which the Secretary of State must decide whether he is required to make a deportation order. The committee believed that the aim should be for the Secretary of State to make that decision as early as possible following a foreign national prisoner&#146;s commencement of his or her sentence of imprisonment.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000113"></a>In the amendment, I am trying to give effect to the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendation, but also to help the Government fulfil the obligations into which they have entered under the European Convention on Human Rights. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000114"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07072329000190"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The amendment requires the notice of intention to deport to be made within three months of the end of a person&#146;s sentence. If he has exhausted his rights of appeal against conviction and sentence, there is no reason why the notice should not have been issued immediately before the end of the sentence so that persons remaining in custody beyond the end of a sentence, as so often happens at present&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has said&#151;is avoided. However, in the cases, which I hope are rare, where the appeal against conviction or sentence is still to be heard when the sentence expires, it would be inappropriate for the deportation order to be made until the appeal has been heard.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000115"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Judd, mentioned the reports of the Chief Inspector of Prisons. I remind the Minister of what she says in her most recent thematic report on foreign national prisoners of July 2006. She criticises,</p>
<ul><a name="07072329000143"></a>&#147;the failure to arrange speedy deportation or removal for the many foreign nationals who want and need to return home as soon as their sentences end&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072329000128"></a>I reinforce that with a quotation from Bail for Immigration Detainees, which says that it is,</p>
<ul><a name="07072329000144"></a>&#147;contacted by many people from prisons and Immigration Removal Centres who do not have legal representatives and are detained for months, or even years, following the end of their criminal sentence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072329000129"></a>We therefore strongly support the spirit of the amendment. We would like to know why, considering the overcrowding crisis in prisons, the Government do not keep records of the number being detained beyond the end of their sentences, and for how long they are held.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000116"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07072329000191"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I support the amendment. Earlier in Committee, I expressed the hope&#151;which has not so far been satisfied&#151;that there would be some greater clarification of what the Home Office intends to do to ensure that people are not still confined after the end of their sentences when deportation is quite clear and may, indeed, be a recommendation of the court that imposed the sentence in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="07072329000117"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07072329000192"></a>Baroness Anelay of St Johns:</b> I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I support the amendment, but perhaps for completely different reasons from those of the noble Lord, Lord Judd. His amendment points to the hypocrisy of what the Government are calling &#147;automatic deportation&#148;. There is nothing automatic about the provisions here. Of course, the Government know that deportations cannot be automatic, because they know that the procedures must be subject to our various conventions and to rules on human rights. We understand that.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07072329000118"></a>It is absolutely right that the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Hylton, should draw attention to the fact that deportation orders should be made as soon

Where legal remedies have been sought and appeals processes have been exhausted, surely we should simply get on with it and resolve the matter, not only for the well-being of the person who is to be deported, as other noble Lords have argued, but for the well-being of people in this country who want to see them go.</p>
<h5><a name="07072338000173"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07072338000002"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07072338000180"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am entirely at one with the intention behind the amendment. Indeed, one could argue that it would be in the Government&#146;s interest if the amendment were accepted on Report because it would enable us to make a significant dent in the prison population. In a sense, I end up arguing against myself because I cannot accept the amendment for other reasons. In fact, the Border and Immigration Agency already often acts faster than the maximum three months after release that would be allowed under the amendment. At present, the Criminal Casework Directorate considers most new deportation cases eight months before the earliest date of release. That is the practice. It aims, wherever possible, to make the deportation order before the end of the sentence to ensure that the foreign national can be deported at the point at which the sentence ends.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000003"></a>Under the Bill, the Secretary of State will, in most cases, make a deportation order within three months of the end of a foreign criminal&#146;s sentence. The caveat is that this will not always be straightforward. Although the automatic deportation provisions will make deportation simpler and quicker, there is no guarantee that all the factors of individual cases will lend themselves to a timely resolution. If, for example, a foreign criminal has an outstanding asylum claim, we would wait for the case to be resolved before deciding whether to make a deportation order. This is because, if the claim were successful, he would be exempted from the automatic deportation provisions under the first exception. Although we hope that the case would normally be resolved within three months, there can be no guarantees, as case consideration, appeals and judicial review processes can take time. Due process must be seen through to give proper effect to people&#146;s rights to challenge.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000004"></a>Preventing a deportation order being made in such circumstances could lead to serious foreign criminals being allowed to remain in the UK. The amendment would risk creating a loophole, thereby letting foreign criminals who frustrate the system for long enough stay in the UK. For those reasons, we cannot accept the amendment, and I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

It is worrying when we put ourselves in jeopardy of undermining both the spirit and the letter of the European convention of which we in this country were pioneers.

I also totally agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that, even if this did not exist, it is simply wrong; it is nonsense. Quite apart from anything else, it is a considerable expense to the taxpayer, which is not logical. There really is a need to expedite matters on this front.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000006"></a>I listened to what my noble friend said. He is a good personal friend, so I cannot help observing to him that it is difficult not to feel a great deal of sympathy with him because he keeps telling us that he agrees entirely with the intention of what is being put forward and then goes through what must be a great deal of mental or moral anguish in telling us why nothing can be done about it. I have used this argument before, but I am serious about it. I sometimes find it sad that, when there is agreement about an intention, all the resources and expertise that are at the disposal of the Government&#151;which are considerable&#151;are not used to the effect that, if the wording or the specific proposal is not right, we find a way to fulfil the intention that we say we totally agree with. I am disappointed that we do not get that. I am disappointed, but I have no alternative: I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000012"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 35 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="07072338000013"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07072338000182"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> We have just been talking about how the Secretary of State can continue to detain a person after the expiry of a prison sentence while he considers whether automatic deportation under Clause 31 applies and in between deciding that it does apply and finally making the order. The first conundrum is why it is not possible in every case to make the order at the same time as the decision that Clause 31 applies, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has just been saying. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain in what circumstances there can be a gap between those two events. If condition 1 of Clause 31 applies, there cannot possibly be a problem; if the person was sentenced to 12 months or more in prison, the Secretary of State would have had plenty of time to consider whether any of the exceptions in Clause 32 were applicable.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000014"></a>If the offence is one of the 320 specified in the NIA Act, which we were talking about earlier, we have to consider several possibilities. If the sentence is less than 12 months, what will happen to the person after the custody plus offence is introduced? That offence comprises a custodial period of no more than 13 weeks, followed by at least six months on licence. If a person is to be deported, what purpose is served by setting conditions on the last few months he spends in Britain that were designed in the Act that created this class of punishment to break the cycle of reoffending  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in this country? Would the Secretary of State use these powers to detain the offender when otherwise he would be out on licence, or would the court be able to impose a condition under custody plus that the offender would voluntarily leave the United Kingdom for the licence period? Another possibility is that the offender was convicted of one of the 320 offences and was given a suspended sentence which, as the noble Lord said on an earlier amendment, would not make him liable to automatic deportation, but would do so if he breached any of the terms and conditions of the licence.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000015"></a>Has that eventuality prompted the drafting of Clause 35(1)(a)? Is it that the Secretary of State needs a breathing space in which to consider whether any of the exceptions apply before he can use Clause 35(1)(b)? ILPA suggests that the offender already could be detained under Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act, but that seems to apply to a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court. In the case of offences specified under Section 72(4)(a) of the NIA Act 2002, the courts presumably would not bother to make a recommendation, knowing that automatic deportation would follow under Clause 31.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000016"></a>In deciding whether to impose a suspended sentence for a Section 72 offence, as the court might do routinely if it knew that deportation would follow a breach of the licence and it would be pointless to clog up the prisons with people who would spend the rest of their lives in another part of the world, the court would have to consider whether any of the exceptions in Clause 32 applied. Would they be able to ask the Probation Service to provide a report on the application of the exceptions before passing sentence?</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000017"></a>Some of the Section 72 offences would be relatively trivial and the persons concerned would pose no serious threat to the public. Clause 35 envisages that there may be cases where the Secretary of State does not exercise the power to detain. Would she be able to impose residence conditions where for any reason she cannot make a deportation order immediately? If she decides not to detain, am I right in thinking that she would be unable to apply electronic monitoring to the person, considering that under Section 36 of the treatment of claimants Act 2004, tagging can be applied only to those who are liable to be detained under the 1971 Act? If I am right on that, would it not have been wise to insert the powers in Clause 35 into Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act, rather than making them stand alone in this Bill? The criteria for placing someone on a tagging restriction include,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000163"></a>&#147;currently not removable by virtue of country of origin&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000141"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000164"></a>&#147;no travel document currently available&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000142"></a>either of which could apply to many people convicted of minor Section 72 offences and given suspended sentences. The intention is surely not to keep people in those categories in detention indefinitely. It would make sense at least to have the option of tagging them.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000018"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07072338000183"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising those issues. Clause 35 gives the Secretary of State the power to detain a foreign criminal at the end of his custodial sentence while she considers  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether he is subject to automatic deportation&#151;I am sure that that much is common understanding. If the foreign criminal is subject to automatic deportation, Clause 35 allows for continued detention pending the making of the deportation order.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000019"></a>This clause also provides that the Secretary of State must detain a foreign criminal against whom an automatic deportation order is in force pending his removal from the United Kingdom unless, in the circumstances, she thinks it inappropriate. Deportation action will, whenever possible, be commenced while the criminal sentence is still being served. However, there will be cases where this is not possible; for example, where a person may meet the criteria for automatic deportation, but is eligible for immediate release by the sentencing court because he has already served the sentence while on remand.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000020"></a>In such cases, it is vital to have a power to detain while the Secretary of State considers whether Clause 31(5) applies. This will help to remove the risk of the offender absconding and protect the public from potential harm. Detention will be strictly limited to the period needed for the Secretary of State to consider whether the individual concerned meets the criteria for automatic deportation. Once a deportation order has been made, the individual will be detained under existing powers in Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971, unless the Secretary of State considers this to be inappropriate. Clause 35 also applies to automatic deportation cases and covers the existing provisions on bail, arrest and restriction orders.</p>
<h5><a name="07072338000174"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000021"></a>The noble Lord asked for clarification of various points. We agree that deportation orders should be made immediately after conviction, but it is not always possible or appropriate to make such an order at the beginning of an offender&#146;s sentence. Where the foreign criminal has been sentenced to a long period of imprisonment, it is highly likely that his personal circumstances, or perhaps the political situation in his home country, would change over time. In that case, the Government might have to make a deportation order, only to have to withdraw it at some later time and place.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000022"></a>The other question was: in what circumstances might it not be possible to make a deportation order within three months of the custodial sentence finishing? As I explained earlier, that might not be possible in a number of instances; the foreign criminal might quite properly have submitted an asylum application, or might refuse to co-operate in establishing his nationality. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also asked what happens when custody plus is involved, and whether the Home Secretary would use powers to detain someone during a licence period or whether leaving the United Kingdom would be a condition of the licence. I do not have a response to those questions now, but they are very thoughtful and give rise to important issues. I will have to write to the noble Lord in reply.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000023"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether the Secretary of State would be able to impose residence conditions on a person liable to deportation. The answer is yes. Clause 35(5) provides that in paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971, which applies to a  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>person detained under Clause 35. This means that a person may, in appropriate cases, be released subject to the conditions of residence, and suchlike. The noble Lord also asked whether electronic monitoring could be applied to someone liable to be detained under Clause 35. The answer again is yes; Clause 35, by virtue of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act, applies provisions of that nature to bail and restrictions, which can of course include electronic monitoring.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000024"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07072338000184"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I may have misheard the Minister, but I thought he said that something in this clause obliged the Secretary of State to take a certain course of action. I do not know quite how that could have come about, if it did, because the very first line of the clause includes &#147;may&#148;. However, I wanted to mention something rather more important at this point. I understand that current deportation practice, combined with the current acute shortage of prison places and overcrowding in prisons, is leading to serious practical problems in the detention centres. In some of them, apparently, some 50 per cent or more of the people there are criminals, some of them serious and violent. That is causing problems, because the detention centres were not designed to hold people of that character, and it is having unfortunate repercussions on the other people there who may be totally innocent of any crime. I must ask whether Clause 35 will actually improve the current situation, and secondly whether things could be arranged so that deportation would follow semi-automatically where a court has recommended that that should happen.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000025"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07072338000185"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> On the noble Lord&#146;s first point, Clause 35(2) requires the Secretary of State to detain a person once a deportation order is made under Clause 31 unless he thinks that detention would be inappropriate. There is always that overriding consideration. The noble Lord describes conditions in detention centres, as he understands them. I am reluctant to comment at length on the noble Lord&#146;s observation. From time to time difficulties and problems arise, of which we are well aware. I shall reflect on the issue that the noble Lord raised and provide him with the rather more considered response that his serious question requires. I am sorry if he is not satisfied with that response; he raised important issues.</p>

I seriously suggest that the Minister takes advice on that point from the lawyers in the department. If I am right, certain other things follow from that conclusion, first, that the Secretary of State has no power to tag anybody who may be released during that period, because tagging applies only where a person is dealt with under Section 36 of the treatment of claimants Act, which applies only to those who are liable to be detained under the 1971 Act. If I am right that a person who is dealt with under Clause 35(1) is not covered by the relevant clause, the noble Lord would have no power to apply electronic tagging to them.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000033"></a>The noble Lord said: During the recent inquiry by the Joint Committee on Human Rights into the treatment of asylum seekers, like other Members I was repeatedly struck by the concerns raised by a vast range of agencies, including the Chief Inspector of Prisons, the Children&#146;s Commissioner and many charities working on the front line, including the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium. Those concerns have been echoed in the House, and I am sure that they will be echoed in the Committee this evening. They focus on why it is necessary to detain children when in practice it is so difficult for families to abscond, as to do so would mean losing contact with all the support that they require, such as healthcare and social services support. We heard very powerfully during our inquiry about the lingering impact that detention has on a child. The only conclusion that we in the committee could reach was that immigration detention was not acceptable for children. In addition, we were clear that detention breaches children&#146;s human rights. It is simply not lawful to deprive a child of their liberty without a time limit simply for administrative purposes.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000034"></a>Despite that, nearly 1,600 children a year are detained unnecessarily and at enormous cost. The Government estimate that cost to be on average some  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#163;1,230 a week for each detainee. I propose the amendment to support the ending of detention for children. The Government recently announced that they intend to pilot alternatives to detention. It would be helpful to have an indication of what those alternatives are and whether the Government can really reassure us that this is the first step towards an end to the detention of children for immigration purposes altogether.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000035"></a>The Government have said that they detain children only as a last resort and for as short a period as possible. Yet the statistics that I have seen suggest that is not the reality for many children. For example, Save the Children found children who were detained for up to 268 days in 2005. That is backed by other members of the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium. What we are witnessing is ongoing detention throughout the asylum process and, most worryingly, in many cases people are being detained and subsequently released.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000036"></a>I cannot overemphasise how damaging this is to the children concerned. The Children&#146;s Society told me about a family with which it is, and had been, working for some time before it was detained. The mother suffered some very severe health complications in detention, from which she still suffers, and the father is now severely depressed. The family was granted temporary release from detention and is still in the United Kingdom. The five-year-old son did not speak at all for some time after he was released, and he still cannot visit the charity&#146;s support project because the bars on one of the windows produce such a strong reaction and remind him of his experience in Yarl&#146;s Wood. As he cannot talk about that experience, it is still not really understood what it means for him. That family is still here. As is the case for half the people detained, according to the charity Bail for Immigration Detainees, the family was released on temporary release. So the assurances we have about detention are simply not adequate to protect children.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000037"></a>Over the past few years, we have witnessed increasingly tough asylum policies, not least in the Bill. As I have argued before, nowhere is there a balance in the system to consider the welfare of the child. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child clearly establishes that the well-being and best interests of each child should at all times be central to all considerations. We need champions for the children caught up in this ghastly experience. That is why I am advocating that children should not be detained, but if they are, Amendment No. 61 would require that, before a decision is taken to detain a child, there must be an independent welfare assessment to consider whether it is necessary to inflict such deep-rooted damage on him, as in the case I highlighted earlier. If we are serious about preventing children arbitrarily languishing in the system, deprived of their liberty, why can we not have a seven-day limit? Why not build that mechanism into the system to change not only practice but mindsets?</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000038"></a>The Committee may be relieved to hear that this is the last of my amendments in Committee. I know that I have said before what I am about to say. However, I

We must recognise that there are people at the heart of any system that we implement, and that, when that person is a child, we must fulfil our responsibilities. Any claim to be a decent, civilised society demands that. We are dealing not with statistics and averages but with an accumulation of individual and tragic cases. If we as a society lose the ability to see it in those terms, we are in deep water when it comes to the future value of our society. I beg to move.</p>

It should be extremely helpful to the Committee and to the House when we consider on Report what to do about the amendments that have been moved in this Committee.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Judd, dealt with particular aspects of the treatment of children and, in Amendment No. 60, their detention under Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act and parts of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. If the noble Lord&#146;s amendment were accepted, it would not be possible to detain a child at the port of entry pending his transfer to the care of the local authority or for the brief period that may be necessary immediately prior to his removal either as a UASC or in the company of his family. Although I agreed that children should be detained for the shortest possible time, to prohibit detention entirely would make immigration control impossible and, in the case of arrivals, in many cases it would be manifestly contrary to the interests of the child for us not to have any power of detention because there would be no protection for the child who is sent on his way from Heathrow because the arrangements with the receiving authority had not been completed. There might even be a trafficker waiting for him on the other side of the customs hall. We need to retain a vestigial power of detention to safeguard the interests of the child, although I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that it should be for the shortest possible length of time.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000041"></a>Amendment No. 61 deals with the detention of children in families who require a welfare assessment to be made by a social services department prior to detention, which must not last for more than seven days. Last Tuesday, I attended a packed meeting of women&#146;s organisations in Committee Room 12 to discuss the detention of women and children, particularly in Yarl&#146;s Wood. I wish that the Minister had been there to hear what was said by outside experts such as Professor Leslie Page, a professor of midwifery, Louise Cooper of Garden Court Chambers, Patti Rundall of Baby Milk Action, and Cristell Amiss of Black Women&#146;s Rape Action Project, as well as former detainees, including Janipher Maseko, whose story I mentioned recently. I wish that the Minister could have heard what was said, or better still that he would visit Yarl&#146;s Wood and listen to what the detainees have to say. In July 2006, the chief inspector, Anne Owers, commented adversely on the centre&#146;s failure to develop systems and procedures to meet the needs of women and to

At the time of her visit, 19 children had been in Yarl&#146;s Wood for more than six months, and, as the centre was not their first place of detention, she emphasised that actual times were even longer.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000042"></a>The Minister said in his letter following the first day of Grand Committee that the Government,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000167"></a>&#147;endeavoured to keep the length of time families are detained to a minimum&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000144"></a>But perhaps I may say that they are conspicuously unsuccessful and are apparently incapable even of keeping records that would enable Parliament to evaluate their performance. On 12 July, we discussed the time that the Government are taking to reply to Anne Owers&#146; reports on the IRCs, and the Minister told the Committee that the reply on Dungavel had been published, although there is no link to it on the chief inspector&#146;s website&#151;a lacuna that ought to be remedied. He said that the replies on Campsfield House and Harmondsworth had been deferred indefinitely, pending the report on the disturbances at the two centres. He did not refer at all to Yarl&#146;s Wood, which caused the Committee the greatest concern.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000043"></a>Quite a few staff left after Serco took over the management of the centre on 1 April. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell the Committee in his next letter the numbers on 30 March, what they are now, and whether Serco intends to lose any more people through redundancies or natural wastage. Is the Minister satisfied that Serco can run the centre effectively and humanely with the present numbers? I can tell him that not all the workers employed there are confident that they can manage to do the job properly at these levels. Certainly, none of the detainees would think that it was possible to do so.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000044"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07072338000191"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> Amendments Nos. 63 and 64 in this group are in my name. Amendment No. 63 deals with record keeping. The noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Avebury, have made clear why it is essential to keep being better informed about how many families are in these settings and about how long children are being held. I will not repeat what I said at Second Reading about speaking with those families. I spoke to a 16-year-old woman who had been in detention for five months and to another mother whose children were there for a second term. Amendment No. 63 would place a duty on the Secretary of State to report regularly to Parliament on the lengths of stay of children in detention centres and to provide other related information on children in the immigration and asylum system. It is a probing amendment to discover how far Her Majesty&#146;s Government have improved their statistics since the report of Sub-Committee F of the House of Lords European Union Select Committee&#151;HL Paper 166&#151;on returns of asylum seekers last year.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000045"></a>The report expressed concern about the quality of information kept on detained families. It records the evidence from the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Children's Commissioner and their common concern about the quality of monitoring of the stays of these families. The Children&#146;s Commissioner, for example, could not determine how many children were held at Yarl&#146;s Wood over Christmas. Members of the  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sub-committee were surprised that a system for logging stays, which is normal in many hotels and is employed throughout the prison system, was not applied in these circumstances. It is recognised that a small number of families have been permitted to stay for an unnecessarily long time in detention. Clearly both Parliament and the Government need the right information to avoid repetition of this. For example, Anne Owers, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, said that the problem is that statistics are,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000168"></a>&#147;a snapshot of the number of people detained at one moment in time&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000145"></a>She continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07072338000158"></a>&#147;What we do not get are regular reports on population ... how many people over a year, how many children over a year, were detained in total, and for what lengths of time they were detained&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000146"></a>Professor Aynsley-Green has talked about the same matter. He says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07072338000159"></a>&#147;We need much more information generally about the whole journeys of children through the system. At the moment there are no child-centred statistics or facts, and as was said just now, they are often invisible&#151;they are seen as appendages to families and not as people in their own right. So we would ask for much greater clarity: how many children and young people; the breakdown by ages, country of origin, family structure; how long they have been there, where they have been detained and their experience of detention&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000046"></a>I shall make one aside as we discuss this matter of information. Families are troubled about the information with which they are provided about the progress of their case. The remarks in the report are what I have heard from families in this setting. It is also what the managers in these settings say. They would welcome the opportunity for families to have better access to information. I join the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in encouraging the Minister to visit Yarl&#146;s Wood if he has not yet had the opportunity to do so. He would find it very helpful.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000047"></a>Amendment No. 64 would give statutory force to Guideline 11 of the Council of Europe guidelines on forced returns of children and families. For example, Guideline 11.1 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000169"></a>&#147;children shall only be detained as a measure of last resort and for the shortest period of time&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000147"></a>Guideline 11.5 states that the,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000170"></a>&#147;best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in the context of the detention of children pending removal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000148"></a>This is a probing amendment, the purpose of which is to learn why Her Majesty&#146;s Government have placed a reservation on this particular section of the guidelines. The Council of Europe document has no statutory force, and this particular section appears to be very much in line with the Government&#146;s own wishes. Surely the Minister can now agree to withdraw the Government&#146;s reservation. The House of Lords European Union Select Committee raised this matter in correspondence with the Minister&#146;s department, and it was a recommendation of its report. The guidelines are an annexe to HL Paper 166, if your Lordships wish to see it. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I reiterate that we need the best information possible on these families in these settings. Otherwise we cannot be reasonably certain that they are being cared for properly. It is costly to

The Government recognise that there are difficult issues around documentation. I hope that the Minister will find this helpful in achieving his own aims of saving money and safeguarding children.</p>

I particularly pick out Amendment No. 64, which states what we all clearly want to happen. It underlines the best interests of the child as the primary consideration. That clearly indicates to me that there should be no separation of small children&#151;or, I hope, teenagers&#151;from their next of kin. The Government might be tempted to separate families as a substitute to detaining them. I urge them not to fall into that temptation.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000049"></a>My noble friend Lord Listowel rightly asked for clearer and better information, but we need not so much statistics as far better practice in the field. For that reason, I urge the Minister to take away this whole group of amendments, consult with his ministerial colleagues in more than just one department and come back with a government amendment at the next stage to improve these children&#146;s situation.</p>

A report on what is happening is a good way of following the facts of what goes on. We know that there are huge problems, but it simply is not right that children should be held in this way. I could not hear all that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said at the beginning, because the sound was not quite working, but suddenly I was able to hear clearly and I agreed wholeheartedly with what he said.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000051"></a>Amendment No. 64 clearly says, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, precisely what should happen. It seems a pity if the Government are not going to include provision to ensure that the guidelines are clear on what should happen with children. The Dungavel centre in Scotland has been mentioned. There was huge concern in Scotland about children being in Dungavel at all. It garnered enormous press, as the Minister doubtless knows. It would be helpful if he could update us on that, if he has any facts. If not, I would be grateful for a letter about it. It is a matter of great concern.</p>

I thank both UNICEF UK and ECPAT UK for their thorough briefing on trafficking to which I have had recourse throughout our debates on the Bill, and with regard to child welfare generally. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, is right to ask the Government to put on the record how they are improving the way in which they gather information on the detention of children in the UK. My noble friend Lady Carnegy is right to reinforce the point that we need clarity of information. It is only on that that one can base proper developments and policy.</p>

As the noble Earl pointed out, the purpose of the amendment is to probe. It is important to know what mechanisms the Government have already put in place to gather such information and how reliable it is. From the contributions of noble Lords so far, one assumes that it cannot be very reliable at all.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000054"></a>We have heard many stories over the past year of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate losing files, misfiling them and failing to asses them accurately. We need to know how and why matters will improve with the change of the old IND into the new BIA. I have read the safeguarding framework which the BIA has circulated in draft form. It states that the agency will,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000171"></a>&#147;be alert to child safeguarding issues (including child-specific persecution and child trafficking) as a result of information collected or known about the child and his circumstances&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000149"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="07072338000172"></a>&#147;endeavour to establish a child&#146;s identity (including age) and nationality&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000150"></a>That information would be reported under the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. How will the agency ensure that it is properly reported in a timely manner? Timeliness is vital if a child&#146;s safety is to be secured, particularly if the agency is to achieve another of the objectives in its draft list, which is to refer information relating to child safeguarding issues quickly, carefully and lawfully to appropriate parties and those organisations with a statutory duty to safeguard children. Therefore, I am very pleased that the noble Earl tabled this amendment.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000055"></a>I agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on Amendment No. 60. There are indeed occasions on which one needs to use detention for the welfare of the person involved. He made a sensitive contribution on that point. All Members of the Committee want the detention of children to be as brief as possible, but we must recognise that there are circumstances in which it must be right for the individual and the security of the country.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000056"></a>At first reading I have a lot of sympathy with Amendment No. 64; the difficulty, as ever, is in the detail. It tries to ensure that the best interests of a child are pursued. I certainly realise the difficulties that the Government would have in accepting that amendment, particularly with regard to subsection (1)(c) of its proposed new clause, which might override the interests of national security considerations.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000057"></a>Members of the Committee referred to the importance of sorting out the child welfare problem that runs throughout this Bill. We had a very full debate on the first or second day in Committee, which seems a long while ago, when we properly drew attention to the importance of ensuring that there is a duty on the agency to protect children and to promote their welfare. These amendments could have been debated then because they have the same objective at heart.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000058"></a>When we first debated my amendment on child welfare, the Minister made it clear that he was very open to negotiations and discussions during the summer so that we might achieve a common result

There is a long way to go before we find commonality on that. With other noble Lords, I shall meet representatives of the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium tomorrow morning to discuss the next step. I assure the Minister that they and we will report back separately to the Government. We are keen to negotiate to solve the problem that all of us want to solve, although getting there will be a problem.</p>

He has been consistent throughout our debate on the Bill, for which I applaud him. I have a fair measure of sympathy, if not to say empathy, with the position from which he is coming. I well appreciate the way in which the Committee dealt with these amendments. I was taken by what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said about detention, the necessity for it and the fact that in some instances it is probably in the welfare interests of young people and children that they are held in a form of detention when they are first caught up in the asylum and immigration processes. That was a mature reflection of his, and I expected nothing less.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said that we needed fewer statistics but a greater adoption of good practices. I entirely agree with him on that. As ever, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her observations on this issue. She is right that we need to ensure that we have the right package of measures in place so that child welfare issues are, and can be seen to be, dealt with properly in a decent and civilised society such as ours.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000061"></a>Having said all those things, which I hope Members of the Committee will view positively, I am sure that they will not be surprised when I say that I must resist the amendments. However, I want to explain our policy on the immigration detention of children and some of the rationale behind it. I accept that the detention of children is an emotive issue and not one that should be approached lightly. Regrettably, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, it is necessary in certain circumstances.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000062"></a>There are two limited circumstances in which children may be detained under immigration powers. The first, and most usual, circumstance is as part of a family group whose detention is considered necessary, most often as a precursor to removal. The second, and wholly exceptional, circumstance is where it is necessary to detain a child while alternative care arrangements are made, and then normally only overnight. I have made that point many times before, not only in this Committee but at Question Time and in some of our debates in the past few years. Our normal policy on unaccompanied minors is that they should not be detained. The one very limited exception is where children are encountered at, for example, ports of entry late at night, and there are no responsible adults in whose care they might immediately be placed. Such a child would be detained very briefly, usually for a few hours or no more than just overnight, until alternative care arrangements can be made with relatives or through local social services.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000063"></a>The Government have been clear for many years that we cannot accept a fixed upper time limit to immigration detention, whether for families or for single adults. Our position has not changed. The current position is in line with the ECHR and associated jurisprudence, which require that detention should be for no more than a reasonable period and should not be prolonged unduly. What is reasonable will vary from case to case, and the actions of parents may of course prolong their detention. In practice, the vast majority of families are detained for periods of seven days or fewer, most often just before their planned removal from the UK. A fixed upper limit, as proposed in my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 61, would serve to encourage individuals to frustrate lawful removal attempts in order to reach the point at which they would be released from detention. That is simply unacceptable. However, I reassure noble Lords that we are not complacent about the concerns about the detention of children. Children detained with their families are given a health-led initial assessment on arrival in detention and their welfare is monitored routinely thereafter. Detention is kept under rigorous and frequent review to ensure that any welfare concerns can be taken into account in deciding whether it should continue.</p>

There comes a point at which it is gradually escalated through the hierarchy of the BIA. Will the Minister please remind the Committee at which point it comes before the Minister? Will he also say in how many cases, when a reference has been made to the Minister, the Minister has decided that the detention should not continue?</p>

<p><a name="07072338000065"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07072338000197"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> That is a reasonable question. Cases of families with children in detention are referred to the Minister for the authority to maintain continued detention when those families are approaching 28 days in detention, and weekly thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000066"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07072338000198"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> How many times has the Minister not agreed to continued detention?</p>

My understanding is that that information is not centrally collated. I will make further inquiries because I appreciate that the information is sensitive. As a snapshot, I can say that, on 31 March, some 50 children were in detention solely under Immigration Act powers. Of those, 40 children had been in detention for less than a month, 10 for between one and two months and the remainder for between three and four months. The noble Lord will have to accept that there may be some slight inaccuracy in that data, but it is a pretty good snapshot indicator. The vast majority are detained for less than a month.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000069"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07072338000201"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I would like to be able to give the noble Earl an answer because he is trying to make a fair point. However, I do not have that information, and I do not think it is collected in that format. It is not frequently the case that people come in and out of detention. It may well happen from time to time, but I do not have data on it. I will see what further information we can provide.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000070"></a>We want to ensure that children are detained only where absolutely necessary. I think it is accepted that that is the case. The code of practice on how the Border and Immigration Agency will help to keep children safe from harm will include specific reference to the arrangements for taking decisions to detain, and to the assessment of children&#146;s welfare while they are in detention&#151;the point that the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, were getting to.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000071"></a>The agency has developed arrangements with Migrant Helpline to provide an alternative to detention for children. The scheme will be run in conjunction with NGOs, which will work with families to help them plan for their return home without needing formally to detain the family in an immigration removal centre. We are grateful to that organisation for its assistance. The key benefits of the scheme will be to reduce the number of children needing to go into an immigration removal centre, coupled with an increase in the number of families choosing to return home voluntarily.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000072"></a>I described the system of ministerial authorisation for the detention of children beyond 28 days, announced in December 2003 to ensure more rigorous oversight of the detention of children. Robust processes are in place to identify and manage families with children entering immigration detention. Removal centres are required to play a positive and active role in this respect and are required to provide information about such detention to the central Management of Detained Cases Unit that oversees the detention of families with children. In the rare event that detention is protracted, the outcome of a thorough process of assessment and consideration is reflected in the advice that the Minister of State receives. He decides on that basis whether detention should continue. </p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000073"></a>Amendment No. 63 imposes a requirement on the agency to report to the Secretary of State and Parliament on children in detention. The report would cover all children detained as a result of the activities of the agency, together with the numbers of children who the agency has attempted to deport and of those remaining in the United Kingdom. This would be an extremely resource-intensive exercise and would serve no practical purpose given the short period of detention of the vast majority of children and the safeguards already in place. Since relatively few children are detained for longer periods, it would be difficult to make public a meaningful report of the type suggested. The agency is currently considering ways to improve the statistical information available on detention of children.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000074"></a>On Amendment No. 64, I have already set out the systems in place to protect children in detention and the reasons why detention is necessary. I am concerned  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the terms of this amendment would invite unwelcome and perhaps spurious legal challenges motivated solely for the purpose of delaying removal. That would not be in the best interests of children. For this same reason, we are maintaining our reservation to Guideline 11 of the Council of Europe&#146;s Guidelines on Forced Returns.  We entered our reservation on the basis that, even as a non-mandatory, non-binding guideline, we were concerned that, if accepted without reservation, its various elements would still be advanced as a basis for legal challenge designed solely to prevent and frustrate removal. It would regrettably become a means of fruitless and expensive challenges in the courts which would have very little, if anything, to do with genuine concerns for a child&#146;s welfare. For those reasons I hope that noble Lords, having heard my rather lengthy commentary, will feel able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000075"></a>I ought perhaps to add a comment or two on some of the questions asked or points made. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, and others were extremely concerned about some of the reports made and heard about Dungavel House. Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07072338000160"></a>&#147;We found centre staff to be extremely supportive of the families and children held at Dungavel. Living accommodation was good, and the crèche was well-run ... Overall, Dungavel is the best-run IRC we have inspected. Within the limits of their responsibility, managers and staff have gone a long way to try to create a generally supportive and decent environment for some extremely vulnerable people; and they are greatly to be commended for this&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07072338000151"></a>I have similar sorts of comments on exactly the same&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07072338000076"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07072338000202"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Having visited Dungavel myself, I endorse the chief inspector&#146;s comments, but that was not the establishment of main concern to your Lordships on the previous occasion. All the comments centred on Yarl&#146;s Wood, and I hope that the Minister will address that and explain why no reply has been published to the chief inspector&#146;s report of last July.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000077"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07072338000203"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I do not have a response to that point, except to say that the inspector made some positive comments even about Yarl&#146;s Wood. She observed that a child protection committee had been established and met regularly twice a month; that the terms of reference were clear and appropriate; that the committee operated as a strategic planning and policy-making group; and that the work plan produced to develop child protection policy and practice was impressive. Those are positive observations. She also observed that progress had been made on detainee welfare, with the appointment of a welfare officer, and that there was sound management of diversity, healthcare and education issues. There are positives there. I accept that in any of these centres there can from time to time be difficulties. We know that Yarl&#146;s Wood has had its fair share. I will try to respond outside the parameters of today&#146;s Committee to other questions raised about Yarl&#146;s Wood if I can.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000078"></a>I have pointed up some of those alternatives to detention that have been under discussion with the Migrant Helpline and the arrangements being  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>developed there. That is a useful initiative we should be pleased to see in development.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000079"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, raised a question about record keeping. He was concerned that poor record keeping meant families and children were kept in detention for longer. I am not sure I can accept that. The noble Earl has an absolute assurance from me that the centres holding families with children keep cumulative totals of time spent in detention, not just the time spent at a particular centre. It is obviously difficult in some of these situations to be absolutely precise, but we have an obligation to keep timely records, and we try to keep rigorously to that.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000080"></a>A number of noble Lords suggested that I might like to visit Yarl&#146;s Wood or other detention centres. I am considering that. I have to make a couple of other visits relating to this Bill and may well build that into the programme over the summer. It helps me to understand better the issues raised and, in general, is a positive thing that should be done.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000081"></a>To return to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about our response, I understand that the Yarl&#146;s Wood action plan has been developed in response to the report by Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons. If the noble Lord has not seen the action plan, I am happy for a copy of it to be made available to him and to other noble Lords who have contributed to our Committee deliberations on this. I thank noble Lords who have played a part in this debate, which has been constructive. I made a commitment earlier that we will continue to have discussions on how we can improve the quality of care and raise standards of practice in detention centres and how we reflect that, not necessarily in the Bill but perhaps in some of the guidance that is issued. That offer of further discussions outside Committee is very much meant, and I hope that we can have some of those discussions in the next couple of months.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000082"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07072338000204"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> I thank the Minister for that lengthy and helpful response. On the keeping of records, to which the Minister particularly referred, it appears from the chief inspector&#146;s evidence that the problem is not that the management at the centre keeps the information on cumulative numbers but that the information is not made widely available. We do not get regular reports on population. The chief inspector regrets that the Immigration and Nationality Directorate website gives only a snapshot of the number of people detained at a particular moment. It was good to hear the Minister say that these statistics are being looked at. Again, things may have changed since the chief inspector gave her evidence at the beginning of last year.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000083"></a>I also thank the Minister for his response to Amendment No. 64, which was helpful. I noted what he said about the comment made by my noble friend Lord Hylton, and I have some sympathy for what he said. Clearly, good practice is the most important thing, but statistics are also important. I am not surprised that he supported what my noble friend said because that supported his case and let him slightly off the hook, but I agree that it is a balance and that one needs both those things.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000084"></a>The Minister knows very well my concern about the supervision of officers working with vulnerable individuals, particularly vulnerable families, so if he has an opportunity to visit Yarl&#146;s Wood, perhaps he could look at how often staff receive individual or group supervision from a line manager of good quality. I am not aware of that being in place at Yarl&#146;s Wood. Having said that, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for adding his name to my amendment and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her support. I may return to the matter of statistics at the next stage.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000085"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07072338000205"></a>Lord Judd:</b> First, I am very grateful to all those who have participated in the debate. The more I have sat on the Committee, the more I feel that the Government have been extremely fortunate that the result of so much hard work and detailed thought has been brought to our deliberations. I have been impressed by the detail of so much of the analysis offered by the Committee. The Government must take all that very seriously.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000086"></a>There is a great deal that I would like to say in response to the Minister&#146;s characteristically&#151;I repeat, characteristically&#151;full, detailed and considerate reply, although this is probably not the time to say it. I shall merely emphasise a couple of points. First, I believe that members of all parties in Parliament and this country have to decide whether to put children first. If we do, that has to be at the centre of all relevant legislation. It is not good enough to indulge in a genuine sentimental commitment from which we retreat when the going gets hard.</p>
<h5><a name="07072338000178"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000087"></a>The arguments about safeguards, better administration and the rest are powerful and important, but they are no substitute for the strategic objective, which is to ensure that no children are in detention&#151;I believe that that is the long and the short of it. Every time anyone looks at this matter from any aspect, that is the conclusion they reach. Yet it goes on. We must not allow ourselves inadvertently to be drawn into aiding and abetting the rationalisation of the processes that prevent the objective being fulfilled.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000088"></a>In my work over many years, including work in this House and its various Select Committees, I have been struck by the damage and financial cost&#151;let alone social cost&#151;and the sad and unnecessary things, like detention, that happen to children in their formative years. Repeatedly, we pick up the consequences later. Therefore, what we are learning in the whole realm of penal policy is highly relevant here. I also believe that on the grave issues surrounding us of security and having the good will of the maximum number of people across the world behind us in what we do to resist extremist forces and to preserve our society, it is terribly important that we are not producing or helping to produce youngsters who are alienated, because alienation is dangerous. Unless we recognise that, we are being very foolish in relating these immediate concerns to the wider issues of security and international stability.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000089"></a>My noble friend will be very much aware of where I stand on this. I thank him for his response. I will go away and consider very carefully what he has said. I

I shall begin my amendment, but I may be interrupted before we finish it.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000102"></a>Amendment No. 67 would give the chief inspector of the Border and Immigration Agency the power to investigate individual cases. We are concerned that without this amendment, the chief inspector will be unable to provide the effective oversight and accountability that will be needed to ensure that the new and extended powers of immigration officers are not abused or misused. We note that Clause 47(4) prevents the chief inspector investigating individual cases, and we do not see the rationale for that. Indeed, earlier, I thought that some of the arguments being adduced with regard to trafficking and the importance of looking at cases on a case-by-case basis were in our favour in ensuring that the chief inspector is also able to look at individual cases.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000103"></a>We believe that our amendment would not be unduly burdensome for the chief inspector. He is given the power to investigate individual cases. We are not saying that he must investigate each and every case. We are giving him the power to select. I presume he could carry out some of the data-matching and data-mining exercises, of which the Government are so fond, to flag up where individual cases merited his further investigation.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000104"></a>Such a use of the chief inspector would enhance public confidence in the ability of the inspectorate to monitor and report on the work of the BIA. Public confidence in the old Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#151;if indeed there was any by the end of last year&#151;was shattered when the Home Secretary

The public will need some persuading that the rebranded agency will be better.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000105"></a>We also have reservations about the reporting mechanism in the Bill. The chief inspector is to report to the Secretary of State under the provisions of Clause 49, and the Secretary of State will lay that report before Parliament. The problem is that the Secretary of State has the power in Clause 49 to remove parts of the report if he thinks that the information could compromise national security or might put an individual&#146;s safety in jeopardy. Both of those are perfectly acceptable reasons, but it is surely important to have an independent referee to ensure that the Secretary of State has acted properly in what is, after all, his censorship of the report. Our amendment would achieve that independent scrutiny by requiring the chief inspector to send his report not only to the Secretary of State but also to the Information Commissioner. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000106"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07072338000207"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The noble Baroness wants the chief inspector to have the power to investigate individual cases, but I confess that I am doubtful about that. The powers of the Chief Inspector of Prisons, who also inspects the IRCs, are determined by Section 5A of the Prison Act 1952, as inserted by Section 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982, which does not include any power to examine individual complaints. Other mechanisms exist for the purpose. First and foremost, there are the independent monitoring boards made up of unpaid outside lay persons, of which there is one to every prison or IRC. Society should be immensely grateful to the volunteers who give something like three days a month&#151;sometimes even more&#151;to this demanding and extremely responsible work. Any prisoner or detainee who is unable to resolve a problem through the normal channels has the right to a confidential meeting with a member of the IMB.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000107"></a>The next line of defence in prisons is the Prisons and Probations Ombudsman who takes on individual complaints, but who has only looked at certain major problems in the detention estate, such as the alleged racism in Yarl&#146;s Wood some time ago when GSL were in charge. It is certainly a matter for consideration whether the Prison and Probations Ombudsman&#146;s remit should be extended to cover the IRCs. If there is a consensus about the necessity for a formal complaints mechanism, I suggest that that would be a better way to proceed than loading it on to the new inspector. Will the Minister confirm that Anne Owers will not continue to inspect the IRCs but that the inspector mentioned in the Bill will be a new person, still to be appointed to look at the IRCs where no doubt the majority of complaints will arise?</p>

<p><a name="07072338000108"></a>If there is to be a formal complaints system of any kind, as opposed to conferring on the chief inspector the right to consider individual cases in the context of a general issue, which she may already do under Clause 47(4), it might lead to the presumption that the removal of a complainant would be stayed until the complaint was dealt with. That would give detainees an incentive to complain at the last minute. If the BIA is successful in reducing the time in

<a name="70723-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000109"></a>That does not mean to say that there are not a great many complaints about the treatment of detainees in IRCs, and making recommendations on the handling of complaints is one of the responsibilities of the chief inspector under this clause, as it is for the present chief inspector under the present regime. She has a great deal to say in every one of her reports; for example, the most recent one on Campsfield House following a visit at the beginning of November last year. We are now told that the Government&#146;s response to those recommendations has been postponed until after the report by Mr Robert Whalley CB on the disturbances on 14 March. That has been the procedure whenever there is a disturbance at any of the IRCs, which occur with alarming frequency. Surely the Secretary of State ought to be obliged to respond to recommendations by the chief inspector within three months of any report and, where she is not ready with a substantive reply at the end of that period, she ought to be obliged to give reasons for the delay. There is all the more reason why the Government should deal with the chief inspector&#146;s recommendations promptly, when it is quite probable that she had covered the very faults that had given rise to a disturbance.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000110"></a>At this stage, I was going to raise with the Minister a letter that I wrote to him this morning, of which I had given prior notice. In view of the lateness of the hour, I think it is best not to burden the Committee with the details of the complaint. Suffice it to say that it was an extremely serious matter of an alleged criminal offence committed in Yarl&#146;s Wood by a person masquerading as a recognised immigration practitioner, who gained entry on two occasions before he was detected on the third occasion. I felt that there was a certain lack of urgency in the investigation of the matter and in the bringing of this individual to justice.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000111"></a>I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is an extraordinarily serious offence for anybody to go into an immigration removal centre pretending to be a recognised immigration practitioner and, so it is claimed, to extract sums amounting to hundreds of pounds from vulnerable asylum seekers for services that he is not authorised to provide. He was committing a criminal offence under Section 91 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. I hope that by making his own inquiries, the Minister will ensure that those concerned get their act together. The police, the OISC and the authorities at Yarl&#146;s Wood must get together to decide how this matter is to be handled, so that within a short period of time the Crown Prosecution Service is able to decide whether to issue proceedings against that individual.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000112"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 68. I do not think that the noble Baroness can give the Information Commissioner a role in deciding whether to omit material from the chief inspector&#146;s report for reasons of national security when Section 24 of the Freedom  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Information Act confers on the Secretary of State an unqualified right to withhold information from the public on those grounds. If we were to consider giving the Information Commissioner a power to second guess the Secretary of State&#146;s decisions on what information should be withheld from the public on grounds of national security, why should it be confined to this report? The matter should be discussed in the context of legislation amending the Freedom of Information Act, and after seven years&#146; experience of how it works, there are good arguments to be made for a review. I doubt whether the Information Commissioner has the expertise or competence to decide whether material should be protected from disclosure on grounds of national security. To enable him to form a judgment on those matters would require him to consider all the arguments available to the Secretary of State, which would be a very considerable extra burden.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000113"></a>As regards the omission of material that might jeopardise an individual&#146;s safety, I wonder whether it is necessary to have this in the Bill at all. The Minister can remind us whether there is an equivalent provision in Section 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982, which deals with the responsibilities of the Chief Inspector of Prisons. If there is not, one would expect that any problems of this kind would be dealt with informally. The chief inspector does not normally refer to individuals by name, but if she did say anything which inadvertently provided clues to a person who might become a target for criminals, one would expect the matter to be dealt with by exchanges between the chief inspector and the department&#151;a common procedure&#151;before the production of any report by an external agency.</p>

<p><a name="07072338000114"></a><b><a name="70723-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07072338000208"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I suspect that this will be the last group of amendments we discuss this evening. I express my gratitude to Members of the Committee who have taken part and to the officials who have kept me well supplied with additional information and further points of elucidation. It has been a long and testing session.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000115"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her amendment, which in customary style she flagged up earlier when we discussed complaints processes. She usefully prefigured it in those comments. In essence, it would allow the chief inspector to set out to investigate any type of individual cases. When I prepared for this debate, I told officials that I thought I recognised this amendment. I realised that I did, but because I have done so many Home Office and other Bills I have completely forgotten when it was tabled. However, I know that I have made similar points to those I shall make this evening.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000116"></a>We believe that the amendment would potentially overload the chief inspector with casework&#151;I agree with the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in that regard&#151;and therefore reduce his effectiveness in assessing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the agency. There are sufficient existing remedies for individuals seeking redress, for example through an appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Complaints about individual cases are handled within the organisation. Those who remain dissatisfied can seek recourse through their Member of Parliament or the Office of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000117"></a>I hope that it will reassure the noble Baroness if I emphasise that, under the Bill, the chief inspector will be able to consider and draw conclusions from individual cases for the purpose of, or in the context of, considering a general issue. For example, where a case adds to the consideration of systemic failures, it will be useful to look at a particular case or cases if they throw up wider issues. But, as a matter of course, the chief inspector will not set out to investigate individual cases beyond that.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000118"></a>Amendment No. 68 would mean that material could be omitted from the published version of the chief inspector&#146;s report only if both the Secretary of State and the Information Commissioner believed that the publication of the material would be undesirable for reasons of national security or because it might jeopardise the safety of an individual. The approach that we have taken reflects existing provision in respect of reports from Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary. I do not believe that the amendment is the right way to proceed. Reports from the chief inspector will be laid by the Secretary of State before Parliament; taking account of any omissions that the Secretary of State believes are necessary.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000119"></a>It is open to an individual to make a request to the Secretary of State for disclosure of other information, and the Secretary of State is under a statutory duty to respond either by providing the information requested or by citing the reasons for not disclosing it. If an individual remains dissatisfied, the proper course is to apply to the Information Commissioner for consideration of the issue. I do not see what would be gained by requiring the Information Commissioner to consider this in advance of the Secretary of State&#146;s decision on whether the publication of any material is undesirable for reasons of national security or because it might jeopardise an individual&#146;s safety.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about the continued role of the Chief Inspector of Prisons. It is our intention to continue to look at the detention estate. We do not want to lose that expertise, and a number of noble Lords have drawn attention to the detail of the inspector&#146;s reports in Yarl&#146;s Wood, Dungavel, and so on. We want to continue with that expertise. Of course the Prisons and Probations Ombudsman will look at individual cases. The Complaints Audit Committee annual report 2005-06 referred to the number of complaints that are made annually about immigration cases, and I think that for that year there were upwards of 26,000 complaints. It appears as a sample that some 90 per cent of complaints arose from delays in decision-making, which is why the Government have properly invested in trying to ensure that we hit our target times and improve the speed of processing cases.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000121"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for his letter today regarding a bogus immigration adviser. I entirely understand what he said in his letter;

I am not in a position to comment on the specific case&#151;it would be wrong if I did&#151;but I offer the noble Lord the assurance that I give to the Committee that this matter is receiving attention, and we take such matters very seriously. I remember moving an amendment in 1999 which strengthened the provisions with regard to bogus immigration advisers who, as described by the noble Lord, try to profit from other people&#146;s positions, and sometimes their considerable misery. We are well aware of these issues, and have been for some time. We are grateful when our attention is drawn to particular cases.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000122"></a>Having said that, and having understood the nature of the noble Baroness&#146;s argument, I cannot accept the amendment. Both amendments are unacceptable to the Government.</p>

Or will Anne Owers cover the whole of the functions of the inspector who is to be appointed under the Bill?</p>

I will consider what the Minister said on Amendment No. 68 about whether it should be the Information Commissioner or somebody else to whom that duty might fall. I seek to include an independent referee.</p>

<a name="70723-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07072338000126"></a>The Minister is absolutely right to say that he has heard these kind of amendments before, not only outside this Bill&#151;he is bang to rights on that&#151;but he has heard them in another place when they were debated by my honourable friends. I should claim for myself that I am consistent in my principles and consistent with my honourable friends, unlike the Liberal Democrats, I am very sad to say. When this matter was debated in another place, the Liberal Democrats did not take part in the debate, but I was delighted to see that they gave their support when we called a Division on Amendment No. 68 and voted with us, at col. 477 on 20 March. But there we are&#151;I am broken-hearted today to have lost that support. I hope it is nothing that I have said or done. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="0707233000013"></a><b><a name="70723-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0707233000072"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Identity (Meg Hillier) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0707233000014"></a>I wish to respond to the publication entitled <I>Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals</I><I>, </I><I>Great Britain</I><I>&#151;</I><I>2006</I>, which is being presented as a Command Paper (7153) today. Copies will be placed in the House Library.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0707233000015"></a>This annual report meets the requirement in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to keep Parliament informed about the use of animals for experimental or other scientific purposes. It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. Some changes have been made to improve the contents and layout of this publication; in particular a more concise report with just the key tables is available in hard copy and supplementary information with additional tables is available on the Home Office website.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0707233000016"></a>The report shows an overall increase over the previous year of 4 per cent in the number of procedures undertaken. The total number of procedures was 3.01 million, an increase of 115,800 over the previous year. There has now been a relatively small increase for the fifth year running and is the highest total since 1992 and marks an overall 15 per cent increase since 2001. A number of factors, investment in research and development and strategic priorities determine the overall level of scientific procedures.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0707233000017"></a>Non-toxicological procedures accounted for about 86 per cent of the procedures carried out. These included fundamental research in human and veterinary medicine to improve understanding of disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic options, and development of vaccines. Most toxicological studies were for the safety and efficacy testing of new drugs and medicines.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0707233000018"></a>Procedures for toxicological purposes accounted for the remaining 14 per cent of all procedures. About 74 per cent of these were for testing the safety and efficacy of new drugs and medicines.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0707233000019"></a>In keeping with previous years, those procedures that used mice or rats (or other rodents) were the great majority at 83 per cent. Those using fish amounted to 9 per cent and those using birds, 4 per cent. The total of all procedures using dogs, cats, horses and non-human primates&#151;that is those species offered special protection by the Act&#151;was less than 1 per cent of the total.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0707233000020"></a>Genetically normal animals were used in about 1.65 million regulated procedures, representing 55 per cent of all procedures for 2006 (compared with 57 per cent in 2005 and 84 per cent in 1995). Genetically modified animals (nearly all rodents) were used in

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0707233000021"></a>Advances in the opportunities to use genetically altered animals for new areas of biomedical research means that the trend of increased production and use of genetically altered animals has continued. It allows a more precise and often less invasive study of physiological processes and disease mechanisms than was previously possible. Most of the animals concerned are mice, which appear and live as normal. Many are used only in breeding programmes.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0707233000022"></a>The licensing system is demand-led and the 1986 Act provides the Home Office, as regulator, with no mechanism for reducing animal use. Instead the Act requires that animal use is kept to a minimum. In addition, the procedures authorised must cause the minimum possible suffering to the smallest number of animals of the least sentience. The Act also requires that, before a project licence is issued, we must weigh the benefits to humans, other animals, or the environment against the costs to the animals involved. A licence cannot be granted if the work could be carried out without using animals.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="0707233000038"></a><b><a name="70723-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="0707233000077"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0707233000039"></a>People claiming incapacity benefit are entitled to receive national insurance credits for periods when they are unable to work. Such credits count towards accrued entitlement to state pension, incapacity benefit and other contributory benefits.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0707233000040"></a>Details of such credits are held on HMRC's national insurance recording system (NIRS2) and this department's pension strategy computer system (PSCS) which records details of periods of incapacity for people claiming incapacity benefit.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="0707233000041"></a>It has become clear that discrepancies exist between the data held on these two systems&#151;as was noted in the National Audit Office's report on the National Insurance Fund in February 2006. These discrepancies have their origin in the introduction of NIRS2 in 1998 and the subsequent transfer of data from PSCS to NIRS2 on periods of incapacity. These discrepancies mean that some people may be receiving the wrong amount of contributory benefit. The main benefits affected are state pension and incapacity benefit. The cases most likely to be affected are those where an individual made a claim for incapacity benefit between 1998 and 2006.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="0707233000042"></a>Action has been taken to ensure that these credits are now being correctly recorded and, accordingly, I am now in a position to announce how this department intends to handle those past cases where errors have occurred.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0707233000043"></a>We estimate that up to 30,000 people may have had underpayments of benefit and about 90,000 have had overpayments. In cases of underpayment, the error does not necessarily mean that individuals have been receiving less money through benefits. For example, in the majority of the cases involving state pension, the underpayments will have been made up by additional pension credit payments. In the case of incapacity benefit underpayments some individuals will have received income support which will have reduced or extinguished any potential loss.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0707233000044"></a>It is, nevertheless, clearly right that all such underpayments should be identified and the correct amount of contributory benefit paid, and any associated income related benefit reviewed. This department will begin this work in August and aims to have completed it by early 2008. In all cases this department will individually contact those affected.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0707233000045"></a>Similarly, in the case of overpayments, many of those overpaid state pension would have had a correspondingly lower payment of pension credit. In respect of incapacity benefit this would, in some cases, have led to a correspondingly lower payment, or no payment, of income support.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="0707233000046"></a>In respect of cases where an overpayment may have occurred, the payments will have been made and received in good faith and I do not believe it would be right to reduce them. I propose, therefore, to introduce regulations which will allow us to continue paying these benefits at their current level to the individuals concerned for the duration of their claim. The draft regulations will be referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee in the normal way before being made and laid before Parliament.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0707233000047"></a>Where the individual is under pension age we will also correct the national insurance contribution records so that future claims will be correctly assessed. Where correcting the record creates any gaps in an individual's contribution record, HMRC will write to the individuals concerned advising them of their options, if they wish to pay any missing contributions.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0707233000059"></a>Guidance on how the Data Protection Act 1998 applies to the use of biometric data in schools is published today by the British Education Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA).</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="0707233000060"></a>Biometric data are increasingly being used in schools as the benefit for schools of running cashless lunch queues, and improved school libraries and attendance systems, become clear. This guidance advises schools fully to involve parents in any decision to introduce this new technology.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0707233000061"></a>It restates schools&#146; freedom to run themselves for the benefit of young people&#151;including introducing new technology to make day-to-day administrative tasks easier.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="0707233000062"></a>The guidance also underlines that head teachers and governing bodies should be clear and open with all parents and pupils about this and all aspects of their education. This will involve explaining what biometric technology is, how it will be used, what is involved, what data will be held and stored, why they are required, how they will be secured, and for how long they will be retained. It also advises that schools should recognise some parents' or pupils' concerns over the introduction of biometric technology and offer alternative systems, like smartcards, to access the same services if they want to opt out.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="0707233000063"></a>Today's guidance sets out how the Data Protection Act 1998 applies to the use of biometric data in schools&#151;building on BECTA's existing guidance on data security and the data protection law.</p>

<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="0707233000064"></a>The Data Protection Act requires that:</p>
schools cannot use biometric information for any purpose other than the express purpose for which  


<notus-date day="23" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS49"></a><b>23 July 2007 : Column WS49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it was collected. This means that data taken for the use on in a library can be used only for that purpose;schools must process all personal data fairly and lawfully. This means that schools must ensure that all pupils, or their parents or those with parental responsibility if schools judge they cannot understand, know what personal information they have on record and how they intend to use it;schools cannot pass on biometric information to any outside organisation nor can third parties access this information;schools cannot keep personal data for longer than they are needed for their specified purpose. Pupils' biometric data must therefore be destroyed when they have left the school; and schools must put appropriate security measures in place to safeguard personal data from unauthorised processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage. BECTA gives clear guidance to schools on data and ICT security.
<a name="70723-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="0707233000065"></a>BECTA and the Information Commissioner already give schools clear guidance on how to comply with the Data Protection Act. This additional guidance is designed to help schools by confirming how the law relates to biometric data and how to comply with it.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="0707233000067"></a>I have seen at first hand how well these systems work. They can speed up lunch queues, remove the need for children to carry money and take away the stigma of singling out those on free school meals. Moreover, they can enable schools to register pupils more easily as they move from class to class.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="0707233000068"></a>Schools are well used to handling sensitive information such as attendance registers, behaviour records and home addresses. But we are absolutely clear that they have to comply with data protection laws.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a><a name="0707234000048"></a>Blackpool produced a further assessment report, submitted to Defra on 21 June. Since the collection of data for the further assessment, additional measures have been introduced to Blackpool town centre to address air quality problems. The Blackpool local transport plan proposes a number of actions which create issues and opportunities in relation to transport demand. The transport impact of each proposal is not yet known, but potentially considerable, and will be fully evaluated through transport assessments and development briefs. Many of the proposed actions are intended for locations near the Promenade area, in the vicinity of the existing AQMA. The further assessment report should provide key information and technical justification to develop an action plan for Blackpool's AQMA that can be fully integrated with the actions planned within the local transport plan.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_83"></a><a name="0707234000120"></a>Waverley Borough Council carried out an initial consultation in early 2006 inviting the public to comment on which measures they felt were appropriate to help tackle the air quality exceedences identified in the three air quality management areas of Hindhead, Farnham and Godalming. Many of the responses focused on the need for a bypass at Hindhead&#151;which is now being taken forward by the Highways Agency. Other measures included reducing traffic levels, in particular of goods vehicles in the central Farnham AQMA. All of the measures raised by the public and additional ones developed within the house are being considered by Waverley's local strategic partnership this month. The goal is to produce a robust draft action plan in the Autumn for consultation by Defra, the public and other stakeholders.</p>

This is seen as the first step along the road to EU membership and will cover political dialogue, support for political and economic reform, aid and trade relations. Conclusion of the SAA will require full co-operation with ICTY. The UK regularly raises ICTY co-operation with the Serb authorities.

The Government already seek to support saving and asset ownership for all across the lifecycle from childhood, through working life and into retirement. Since 1997 the Government have introduced the individual saving account (ISA) so that everyone has access to a tax-advantaged savings scheme and introduced the child trust fund (CTF) so that in the future all children will enter adulthood with a financial asset regardless of family background and piloted the saving gateway to explore ways in which matched funding can promote saving in lower income households. The Government have also introduced stakeholder pensions to offer simple, low cost pensions to those without access to an employer pension and radically simplified the pensions tax regime to offer greater individual choice and flexibility in when and how people save for their retirement.</p>

The UK and a number of other member states underlined that the EU common position on Zimbabwe does not allow for the issue of visas to President Mugabe and other specified members of the Zimbabwean Government to visit EU member states except in certain narrowly defined circumstances. As the noble Viscount will understand, those discussions were held in confidence and I do not therefore propose to list the individual countries and the arguments they made.</p>
