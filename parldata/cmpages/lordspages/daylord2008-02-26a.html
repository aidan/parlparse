Other initiatives, such as anti-drink-drive and anti-speeding campaigns and the provision of 20 mph zones, can contribute to cyclists&#146; safety.</p>

Does he agree that one of the main campaigns must be to encourage children to cycle to school? Once they have learnt to cycle and used cycles as children, they will carry on doing so as adults and will, I hope, cycle to work. What exactly are the Government doing to encourage cycling to school safely&#151;with new cycle routes or whatever&#151;and so to encourage parents to allow their children to do that?</p>

In January this year, we announced that we are investing in cycling a record &#163;140 million over the next three years, through Cycling England. Much of that money will be directed towards improving training and standards of cycling. That is a very good investment when it is put into the hands of those who train schoolchildren. It will provide&#151;by, I think, 2012&#151;for some extra half million children to have access to new cycle training and will create some 250 additional links to school to encourage home-to-school cycling.</p>

The last time we had a short discussion on this topic, a number of noble Lords said the same thing. Yes, of course, we have occasional instances of pedestrians being hit by cyclists, but it is profoundly the case that pedestrians are most at risk from cars. Sadly, cases of pedestrians being hit by cars in any given year generate a lot of fatalities&#151;last year, there were some 471&#151;although, thankfully, those numbers are coming down. The number of pedestrians who are injured by cyclists is very small. I think that there were 47 recorded incidents in which there was some form of injury.</p>

What are the Government doing to improve the lighting on cyclists at night? Every evening when I leave here in the dark in a taxi, I would be prepared to give evidence on behalf of the taxi driver if he hit a cyclist who has no lights on the back of his bike and is impossible to see until you are on him.</p>

She is right that we should remind cyclists to take much more care, because it is important that they are visible. A key component of encouraging safer cycling is to ensure that, as part of the training, cyclists are told to be more visible and to have sensible lighting fixed to their cycles.</p>

Does he agree that, as well as reducing the number of road deaths, that would mean that pedestrians and cyclists could share the road? That would certainly encourage people to cycle and it would encourage children to cycle to school, as my noble friend suggested, as there would be much less likelihood of injury.</p>

However, it is for a local authority to determine where it is most appropriate to put 20 mph zones. Such zones certainly have a significant impact on reducing accidents and deaths. I shall give a couple of statistics. The Transport Research Laboratory found that, in the UK and other EC countries, child road accidents fell by 67 per cent and cyclist accidents by 29 per cent in areas where there were 20 mph zones. I do not think that there should be default zones of 20 mph because I believe that the beauty of 20 mph zones is that they are self-enforcing. If you impose a default speed limit of 20 mph, you perhaps lose that benefit.</p>

What steps are the Government taking to protect pedestrians from cyclists? First, would he think it a useful beginning to enforce the law on riding on pavements? Secondly, and perhaps most important, could he make it a legal requirement for bicycles to carry a bell, as they used to do in the old days?</p>

The noble Viscount makes a fair point about enforcement. One positive thing that we have done is to ensure that community support officers, along with the police service, can impose fixed penalty notices, which has aided and added to enforcement. It remains the case that the major problem for pedestrians is the potential for a road traffic accident caused by a car and not a cycle. We need to keep a sense of proportion about these issues.</p>

Indeed, I am assured that now that the forum is properly established as a voluntary organisation it is in a position to seek financial support through different sources, including Section 64 of the general scheme through which the Department of Health provides support for the voluntary and community sector.

Reducing alcohol-related hospital admissions is a new measure of performance for the NHS. We believe that this will encourage more NHS investment to identify those most at risk and provide advice and treatment. However, this strategy is not about preaching to or hectoring people.

On the price of alcohol, there is definitely increasing public concern that harmful drinking is fuelled by the sale of alcohol at heavily discounted prices and other promotional tactics. We currently lack comprehensive evidence on this issue and views are divided. The Department of Health has therefore commissioned an independent review of the relationship between pricing, promotion and harm, which will help to inform our understanding of this and our decisions on whether to take any action on the impact they have.</p>

In the light of this, does she agree that advertising may not be so much to blame as the TV soaps and reality shows that use drunkenness and alcohol misuse as forms of entertainment?</p>

As the noble Baroness has said, there are tough rules on advertising, particularly to the under-18s, but the review of the interrelationship between alcohol pricing, promotion and harm will be reported on this summer, and it will include an examination of advertising in all its forms: TV, radio, above and below the line, sponsorship, and the internet.

Since 2006, we have introduced new powers to penalise licensed premises that persistently sell alcohol to under-18s. We have introduced new powers to direct individuals to leave an area and prohibit their return. We have focused binge-drinking initiatives on four of the national hotspots, and at this moment 720 young people have been referred to advice sessions about safer drinking. Early studies show that reoffending rates are down by 50 per cent, and we are currently rolling out this initiative to 10 new areas.

As he will recall, however, on 14 January he addressed your Lordships' House on the same subject and informed us that &#163;150 billion-worth of assets were available in Northern Rock and that the amount of government liability was but a fraction against that; it was said at the time to be &#163;56 billion. Since then, as he will be aware, we have had references to Granite and to Dolerite. Note 22 of the recently signed 2006 accounts for Northern Rock lists 23 companies performing the same function. Would he therefore like to say the same thing again today&#151;that he is still comfortable that the liability is but a fraction? It sounds as though the liabilities are now a fraction of the guarantee.</p>

As was made clear in both Houses in the debate last week on Northern Rock, Dolerite does not exist and the guarantees do not extend to Granite. The guarantees extend to Northern Rock and its assets. Its assets are secure and outweigh its liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="08022650000179"></a>He was subsequently obliged to write to my noble friend to say that he had got it all wrong and that the Treasury had nothing to add to the singularly uninformative letter to Mr Vincent Cable a week ago. Does it not mean that the Treasury is every bit as much in the dark about the true complexity of the relationship between Granite and Northern Rock as the rest of us? Will the Minister therefore put in place an investigation without further delay, preferably conducted by the National Audit Office, into the full facts of this tangled tale and the risks to the taxpayer that follow from it?</p>

However, I am grateful for the opportunity that he affords me, and which I recognised would be presented by this Question, to apologise for the fact that I made a mistake yesterday in responding to the noble Lord. I intended to convey that the Government will in due course be presenting, in full publicity, the Northern Rock strategic business plan. I am happy to confirm that they will do that.

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08022650000066"></a>I emphasise that Granite has no relevance to the public position at all. The Treasury guarantee and the loans provided by the Bank of England have nothing to do with the assets in Granite. The guarantees relate to the assets in Northern Rock. Those are sound, substantial and above the level of loan that it has taken from the Bank of England. As the noble Lord will know better than anyone else, Granite is merely a securitisation vehicle for the processing of Northern Rock money. Those responsible for meeting the costs of Granite are bond holders, not Northern Rock&#151;therefore, not the Government at all.</p>

I have tabled these sharply defined amendments to enhance the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and passed by the House on Report, providing for a triennial report to Parliament on the working of this Bill. These amendments simply provide for a clearly defined, specific enabling power. They would not impose any additional burdens or give the Secretary of State extensive powers.  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_555"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 555</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Instead, they would strengthen parliamentary accountability. The wording has been specifically chosen to reflect the helpful comments made on Report by noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08022650000075"></a>This Bill will have a considerable impact on the charitable sector. I declare an interest as vice-president of Marie Curie Cancer Care, which, along with 53 other charities, is part of the Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition. The coalition supports these amendments.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08022650000076"></a>Amendment No. 1 is crucial. Without it, the register would not work as a one-stop shop search facility, which is essential if charities are to be able to conduct searches quickly and cost-efficiently. In the case of deceased estates, information about the financial institution in which the asset is held is unlikely to be known, hence the difficulty in utilising the new industry tracing scheme, which requires an approach to each and every individual bank. My amendments would maximise the incentive for banks and building societies to reunite people, including the beneficiaries of wills, of which many are charities, with what is rightfully theirs&#151;their assets in dormant accounts&#151;while also ensuring that, where reunification efforts prove fruitless, as much as possible is available for reinvestment in society.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08022650000077"></a>As drafted, the Bill will not require financial institutions to make data on unclaimed assets more easily accessible to potential beneficiaries of legacies. Instead, banks and building societies will simply be asked to publicise the fact that they hold unclaimed assets. This will be of no help to people who do not know which institution is holding a lost asset. Crucially, it will be of no help to charities trying to trace lost assets bequeathed to them from deceased people&#146;s estates. This will be a particular problem for small charities.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08022650000078"></a>Why does it matter? One in seven people who die with a valid will leave legacy gifts to charity, which, on average, comprise 5 per cent of the total estate left, so there are potentially large sums of legacy income that have yet to reach the named charities. Legacies are an extremely important source of voluntary income for the charitable sector. For example, 46 per cent of the British Heart Foundation&#146;s voluntary income is from legacies, amounting to more than &#163;47 million last year, while Cancer Research UK relied on legacies for a third of its income. There may have been many more bequeathed amounts that could have gone to the charities, but these are unknown at present.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08022650000079"></a>The banking and building society industry has introduced a welcome new online tracing scheme, the launch of which coincided with the Bill. However, while this is a step in the right direction, it is completely inadequate and does not create the register needed if beneficiaries, including charities, are to be more easily reunited with their assets. The online tracing scheme is not straightforward. It requires knowledge of which institution holds the account and it does not enable searching across a broad range of banking institutions.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08022650000080"></a>Let me now address a few of the issues raised by your Lordships on Report, when I proposed giving powers to the Secretary of State to establish a register if needed. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, suggested that charities want access to accounts long  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_556"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 556</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>before they have become dormant. I have been reassured by the coalition that the key point is to establish a system where basic details of accounts can be searched for by registered charities after dormancy has been established. The charities may have to wait, but so be it.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08022650000081"></a>The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, mentioned cost, stating that a register would be expensive. The Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition believes that a register should be no more costly to run than a voluntary scheme. In fact, a register could be self-financing and need not be maintained by the Government. Moreover, in the longer term, having such a system in place would reduce administrative burdens. A central register would establish a consistent system and format for information about dormant bank and building society accounts and would facilitate searching, particularly by small charities which do not have the manpower to undertake widespread searches, as well as shorter processes for financial institutions to locate and return dormant accounts to their rightful owners.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08022650000082"></a>The Minister also raised confidentiality issues. The coalition has sought advice from Withers legal partnership, which has now been shared with the Treasury. Withers confirms that data protection and fraud issues would not be a barrier to a register. I can therefore assure the House that the amendments would not breach confidentiality of information agreements. Indeed, a register would be less open to problems of data protection than the scheme operated by industry at the moment.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08022650000083"></a>The industry&#146;s new online tracing scheme operates on a central website portal where people can enter their personal details. These details are then sent to a number of banks and building societies around the country, increasing the risk that information could be intercepted or diverted. In contrast, a central register would hold minimum data centrally, such as the name of the account holder, their date of birth and their previous or last known address. The register would enable someone to establish only whether there was a match between a legatee, for example, and a dormant account. It would then direct the charity conducting the search to a specific institution. The charity would still be required to go through stringent proof-of-identity processes with the institution holding the asset. That would be no less rigorous than any other proof-of-identity process required to access accounts. A number of other tried and tested schemes around the world use a register system, including in the US and Australia.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08022650000084"></a>I agree with the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that accountability to Parliament is vital and I am sorry that she is unable to be in her place today. My amendments would strengthen that accountability and enable Parliament to effect its wishes without recourse to further primary legislation. I worry that there is a presumption that assets in dormant accounts are somehow the state&#146;s money. They are not. These assets are not ours, the Government&#146;s or Parliament&#146;s, and they are certainly not the industry&#146;s. They are unclaimed assets in dormant accounts that in many cases have been bequeathed, as a proportion of a deceased estate, to a charity. The tightly drafted amendments would help to ensure that people&#146;s dying

The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, referred to the 54 charities that comprise the Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition. I know from my own contacts with the group how passionately those charities feel about this matter. These amendments afford your Lordships&#146; House an opportunity to improve the legislation before us and to enact a profound good.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08022650000086"></a>At this stage of our deliberations I do not intend to repeat the powerful arguments advanced by the noble Baroness. Instead, I shall draw your Lordships&#146; attention to the benefits of the amendments in a slightly broader strategic context. Here I declare an interest as a trustee of Christian Aid and chairman of the Melanesian Mission UK. Of the first of these charities most, if not all, of your Lordships must surely be aware, but of the second I suspect that few will have heard. Yet it is the latter, the Melanesian Mission UK, which, as the smaller charity, is particularly pertinent to our deliberations today. Why? For the simple reason that legacies are even more important to smaller charities, which simply do not have the means or the infrastructure to fundraise to anything like the same extent as the bigger charities. They lack the resources to engage in a complex search for assets that, in the form of legacies, it was intended that they should receive and they stand to lose disproportionately more from the lack of an ability to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08022650000087"></a>Like the noble Baroness, I have looked at the membership of the charity coalition that has expressed such concerns about the Bill in its present form. The breadth of the coalition is extensive and impressive. I also know from my own experience from chairing bodies such as the Devon Strategic Partnership&#151;its aim is to improve the quality of life for people living in Devon by bringing together a huge and disparate range of interested parties to tackle a diverse range of issues such as transport, energy, domestic violence and welfare benefits&#151;that bringing people together to sing from the same hymn sheet is not easy. Yet this coalition is singing from the same hymn sheet. It deserves to be listened to in this one respect more than it has been to date.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08022650000088"></a>I am told that at least 26 Members of your Lordships&#146; House are patrons of some of the charities within the coalition. Many others will have supported these and other charities in many different ways. With these amendments, we are being given the opportunity not just to do as the Minister rightly suggested on Report, which is to thank our marvellous charity sector for the invaluable work that it does, but to give a practical demonstration of our support for all charities, which are so vital in a healthy society, whether they be small or great, in memory of a loved one or an international charity such as Christian Aid that is literally changing the world for people in the direst poverty and offering them real hope of life before death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08022650000089"></a>The point at issue is not just about gratitude. It is also most profoundly about justice and respect&#151;not just for and to the charities but for and to those who do, and wish to, support them and who have made their wishes very clear as they have drawn up their last will and testament in preparation for their own death. It is about the justice of doing everything that we reasonably can to respect people&#146;s dying wishes to leave something to charity and of ensuring that charities are thus reunited with any unclaimed assets that have been bequeathed to them; in other words, what is rightfully theirs. That is what the noble Baroness&#146;s reasonable, tightly defined and beneficial amendments would help to achieve and it is why I urge your Lordships to give them the support that they deserve.</p>

I have even more now. This will be a great opportunity for fraudsters to examine the register in detail to determine whether they can extract money from it. I do not altogether understand who will carry the cost of drawing up the register and, indeed, of maintaining it. Some cost must be involved and I am not at all certain who is supposed to carry it.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08022650000091"></a>Another worry is that when charities look to people&#146;s wills they surely look to bequests that come off the top layer of a will. The only thing that will be left in a dormant account is the residual amount in that will. Therefore, the charity would have had to be left absolutely everything in somebody&#146;s will before it would be in a position to pick up what was left in a dormant account.</p>

<a name="80226-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08022650000092"></a>I have a further concern about our charities generally. So many of them now seem to have massive headquarters in London and spend their whole time playing politics. The rather depressing thought occurs to me that they would add to their numbers by having yet another person to go through the register to see whether they can leach a bit more money out of dormant accounts. So I have reservations about this measure and it is only right that I should mention them.</p>

Picking up the points just made by the noble Lord, obviously some costs will be entailed in maintaining a register, but I submit that they are surely worth bearing when a scheme short of a register, such as is offered by banks and building societies at the moment, is not fit for purpose and is ill adapted to enabling beneficiaries to be reunited with assets bequeathed to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08022650000094"></a>The noble Lord spoke about residuary bequests. If one knows anything about legacies left to charities, one knows that residuary bequests are of great importance. They are the preponderance of bequests; only a comparatively small number of specific legacies are

It is therefore very important for charities to be able to access residuary bequests if they are to benefit from legacies left to them.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08022650000095"></a>Finally, the noble Lord referred to charities with large headquarters in London that carry on campaigning work with government. It is not necessary to reply to that. Anyone who knows about the large amount of work, across a broad range of activities, that such charities carry out, and their valuable work in making representations to government on behalf of the groups they represent, will realise the necessity for maintaining premises and employing substantial numbers of staff. I will not dwell on that point. I declare my interest as chairman of one such large society, the Royal National Institute of Blind People.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08022650000096"></a>Turning to the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, I will not range over the whole course of the subject matter that she addressed. I underline the point I just made about the respects in which the current scheme offered by the banks and building societies is not fit for purpose in addressing the need for a register that charities and individuals benefiting from legacies can access. The banks and building societies have launched a new online tracing scheme. This obviously represents a step in the right direction. However, there are still key gaps in the scheme, which mean that it does not amount to a register. The charities coalition, as we have heard, therefore believes that it is vital to maximise the opportunity over the longer term for the industry to get the scheme right. The amendments tabled by my noble friend provide a framework within which that can be done.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08022650000097"></a>The new online tracing scheme is problematic in at least six ways. First, it is far less straightforward to look for lost bank accounts than it is to search across building society accounts and the National Savings and Investments database. Secondly, it requires some knowledge of which institution the account is held in. Thirdly, it covers only dormant bank and building society accounts. Fourthly, it does not enable people to search across a broad range of banking institutions. Fifthly, it is not clear whether the scheme incorporates different types of bank accounts; for example, internet bank accounts. Sixthly, it is not clear what records are included, or how far back records go.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08022650000098"></a>At the moment there is no requirement for individual institutions to take part and members of the public are currently unable to search across a range of banks if they are not sure which institution is holding a lost asset. That is why the charities coalition is calling for the creation of a register of all unclaimed assets, which would ensure that beneficiaries&#151;whether individuals or organisations such as charities&#151;were reunited with assets owed to them from deceased people&#146;s estates. To reunite assets and beneficiaries, members of the public and charities must be able to search a database with minimal information in the first instance&#151;full name, last known address and, perhaps, date of birth, all of which are already publicly available. In the case of deceased people&#146;s estates, information about the financial institution in which the asset is held is unlikely to be known, hence the  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_560"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>difficulty in fully utilising the new industry tracing scheme, which requires an approach to an individual bank.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08022650000099"></a>Furthermore, currently there is no requirement for financial institutions to make data available to any schemes. For the Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition, the key to establishing a successful system is to ensure full participation by all financial institutions. As currently drafted, the Bill will not compel financial institutions to make data more easily accessible to the general public. Banks and building societies will simply be asked to publicise the fact that they hold unclaimed assets. That will be of no help to people who do not know which institution is holding a lost asset, and it will be of no help to charities trying to trace lost assets belonging to deceased people&#146;s estates.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08022650000100"></a>Any register need not be maintained by the Government. It will, however, need to be created and maintained using stringent measures against fraud, as applied by, for example, the many unclaimed assets schemes operating in the United States. That means that no data beyond confirmation of a match between an institution holding an unclaimed asset and the details, which I mentioned earlier, as input by someone conducting a search would be released unless and until full proof of identity is produced to the institution holding the asset. This would be no less rigorous than any other proof of identity required to access an account.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08022650000101"></a>To sum up, although the banks and building societies are launching a new online tracing scheme, this is not the same as a register, which is what the charities coalition is calling for. There is no requirement for individual institutions to take part and members of the public will not be able to search across a range of banks if they are not sure which institution is holding a lost asset. That is why the charities coalition continues to ask for the creation of a register.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08022650000102"></a>As my noble friend has indicated, this is a moderate amendment. It does not call for the establishment of a register straight away. It gives the opportunity to see how the Bill will work as an Act until we get the first report of how it is working. It creates a reserve power for the Secretary of State to establish a register only if and when the report indicates that the scheme needs to be improved. I also ask noble Lords to support this valuable amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="08022650000103"></a><b><a name="80226-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022650000519"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, as we debated the Bill at earlier stages, there was growing consensus that one of the most important things that it might achieve would be to increase the extent to which people were reunited with their assets rather than spending assets on worthwhile things that had been disunited&#151;if that is the right word&#151;from their owners. I very much agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said about that.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08022650000104"></a>In Committee, we tabled an amendment for the creation of a register. We did not pursue it on Report because we wanted to ensure that we changed the Bill as far as we could, which required us to get the maximum level of support from across the House,  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_561"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 561</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which did not extend to the establishment of a register from the start. However, to have a reserve power to establish a register, which is what the amendment seeks, merely adds somewhat to the amendment that we successfully passed on Report. Therefore, we are very happy to give it our full support.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08022650000105"></a>I hope that when the Minister replies, he does not use as a principal argument the fact that the scheme is technically a voluntary scheme. Again, we discussed that at great length at earlier stages. This is a statutory scheme in terms of how the money is spent, and I suspect that the only reason that noble Lords did not absolutely press for it to be a statutory or compulsory scheme from the start in legislation is that we received assurances from the trade associations, banks and building societies that every bank and building society that might be covered and affected by it would be a member of it. I do not believe that it is a valid argument that the amendment is irrelevant, unnecessary or inappropriate because it is a voluntary scheme.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08022650000106"></a>However, I hope that it will never be necessary to bring the power into force. The British Bankers&#146; Association, the Building Societies Association and NS&amp;I have established the website www.mylostaccount. org.uk. Although I accept that at the moment it does not meet all the requirements that we would like, the pressure that the legislation has already caused has meant that the website is now up and running. In the three weeks since its launch, it has had some 72,000 claim forms submitted&#151;more than for the whole of last year. That progress has happened only because this Bill has been going through your Lordships&#146; House. Having this reserve power hanging over the banks and building societies as a sort of Sword of Damocles should be used by the charities coalition as a means of getting improvements to the website over the next year or two so that it achieves everything that it wishes.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08022650000107"></a>From my perspective, it does not matter desperately whether it is a formal register, against which every name on a dormant bank or building society account can be checked wherever it is held, or a simple search facility in which submitting a name and a few minimal details automatically searches across all of the banks and building societies that might be holding a dormant account. That seems to be a technical issue. However, I hope that, having established the website in its current form and having seen its success over the past three weeks, the banks and building societies will be encouraged to develop it further, particularly in the ways suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Low.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08022650000108"></a>If it comes to a vote, we will therefore support the amendment in the Lobbies. I hope very much that that will not be needed.</p>

I want to express my hope that the Government will give them a fair wind. I must declare an interest since in the course of my medical career I have become either president or vice-president, or patron or vice-patron, of about 11 medical charities of various kinds. While I accept some of the constraints that were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, and others, I must point  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_562"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 562</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out that the contribution to medical research and care made by charities in the United Kingdom has been absolutely outstanding.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08022650000110"></a>There is no doubt at all that, despite the significant increases of government funding that we have seen in recent years&#151;through organisations such as the Medical Research Council, the National Health Service, and so on&#151;those charities produce at least 50 per cent of the funds spent on medical research in the United Kingdom and they are largely dependent on bequests. I am, of course, not just talking about big players such as the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK, or the Wellcome Trust, which has been quite outstanding in its support, but, more particularly, the smaller charities that have often been established by people with an interest in specific diseases. I refer to charities such as the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, the Alzheimer&#146;s Society and the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, of which I have the honour to be an honorary life president. Such charities are, to a large extent, dependent on bequests and so on; in some instances, there is no doubt that funds which should and would have come to them under bequests have, somehow or other, been left in dormant accounts.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08022650000111"></a>This amendment is a step along the road in trying to put that position right. Despite what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, charitable foundations have made a tremendous contribution&#151;not just to fundamental research and the care of sufferers from many of these diseases with which I have been familiar throughout my professional career, but in funding translational research. That has meant that they are funding research that translates the findings of basic laboratory research into developments in patient care. For that reason alone, I am very happy to support the amendments.</p>

<a name="08022650000112"></a><b><a name="80226-0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022650000521"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> My Lords, as I understand it, we are debating Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 as well as Amendment No. 1. I will concentrate my remarks on Amendment No. 2. When we discussed these matters in Committee and on Report, it became clear that charities, which are clearly concerned about these issues, could gain in one of two ways that are, to some extent, competitive. On the one hand, it could be that the rightful owners of the assets were not found, and that the assets then ended up in the so-called reclaim fund with the proceeds&#151;or what remained in that fund&#151;being distributed, unfortunately in my view, by the National Lottery to various deserving causes. So the charities could benefit in that way. Alternatively, it could be that they found that they were entitled to a legacy&#151;as I understand it, that is very important in the case of small charities&#151; and they would make a direct claim on a particular asset that had laid dormant in the bank. Obviously, if this second group made a successful claim, the first group would lose out, although in fact they might all be part of the same charity.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08022650000113"></a>The other problem that arose was with regard to confidentiality. I have some experience in these matters, because I was asked some 10 years ago by Mr Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_563"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Reserve, to become an arbitrator with regard to the Claims Resolution Tribunal for Dormant Accounts in Switzerland. I had not fully appreciated from that experience that that was a very unusual circumstance because the Swiss Government had legislated so that the names of the account holders could be revealed. I understand that that is not true except for accounts that have been dormant since World War 2. Therefore the situation in Switzerland and here is that bank confidentiality is regarded as very important and my understanding is that the banks are not prepared to release the names of the people concerned so that, for example, charities could discover whether they had a legacy or not.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08022650000114"></a>Amendment No. 2 gets around that to a considerable extent but involves the establishment of a register, which would be a sensible development. The register could remain confidential, but under paragraph (b) of new subsection (3B) of Amendment No. 2, it would be possible for a charity which believed that it had a legacy in a dormant account to go to the registrar and ask him whether that was so. As the noble Baroness pointed out, that is an extremely difficult process at present because you do not know which bank might have the account, whereas if there was a register all the accounts would be coalesced.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08022650000115"></a>This is the right approach; it would maintain confidentiality but enable the charities to ascertain whether in a particular case they were entitled to obtain what was rightfully theirs. It has been pointed out that this is a modest amendment; we can see how the scheme operates for three years before there is a report, but at least at that stage it will be sensible to consider the establishment of a register, and we can review the whole thing in the light of the experience of the charities in the mean time. We certainly do not want to come back to primary legislation at that stage and, therefore, it is right that we support the amendments.</p>

It is run by and for disabled people to promote equality of opportunity, choice and independence for all disabled people by removing barriers and ensuring that support services meet the needs of disabled people in the borough. Services include a wide range of youth activities such as holiday schemes for profoundly disabled young people, help for disabled people with finding employment, welfare rights and benefits advocacy, support for people receiving direct payments for their personal assistance, and an information service.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_564"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trusts. It is matter of constant juggling and piecing together of pockets of funding and trying to add them together to form viable projects which do not raise people&#146;s expectations only to dash them within a few months. In other words HAFAD&#146;s continued viability can be somewhat precarious and its reliance on the generosity of others, whether in terms of time or money, is constant. As we face the spectre of an economic downturn and a period of financial uncertainty, think what a difference finding an unclaimed asset in a dormant account left as part of a legacy might make to a charity such as HAFAD. That is what these amendments would help charities such as HAFAD to do.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08022650000119"></a>The reason why these amendments are particularly important for small charities such as HAFAD is their simplicity. That point seems to have been ignored by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton of Epsom. The proposed register would mean the least amount of bureaucracy possible to enable a charity to access the funds which local people have intended it to receive. While trustees might be able to gather together various pots of money for funding a project, trying to find funding for the ongoing management of the organisation is well-nigh impossible. Small charities simply do not have the person power to trawl through bank and building society accounts trying to trace lost assets, a point which has been so eloquently put by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter. That is why this amendment is so important and why I am pleased to support the noble Baroness today. She understands the difference that small local charities, in particular, can make to people&#146;s lives, often with very little resource. I want charities to know that the law is on their side and that this House has done everything in its power today to reunite them with the assets which are rightfully theirs.</p>

If a register is created, then there must be access to it for it to be of any use. Access by outside bodies, however honest, noble and reliable they may be, means an erosion of privacy, even if it is a modest one. The very existence of a bank account may be a confidential matter. I am uncertain whether the gains from having a central register would make up for the loss of this important principle.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08022650000123"></a>In this day of easy, quick and cheap electronic communication, it is no more difficult to ask a number of financial institutions to search on your behalf than it is to search yourself&#151;indeed, that is probably easier, especially for the smaller charities, which do not have the resources to make the search. The important principle of banking confidentiality would be maintained.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08022650000124"></a>As was pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, Clause 12, which was introduced by my noble friend Lady Noakes, provides for a triennial review of the operation of the dormant account arrangements. With the knowledge that this spotlight will be pointed in their direction, there will be every incentive for financial institutions to make a success of the scheme and to give all assistance to those wanting help in finding assets that belong to them.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08022650000125"></a>We should remember that banks and building societies are massive givers to charity&#151;they give tens of millions of pounds&#151;and it is unlikely that they would not want to help. The issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, have been raised in turn with the BBA, which has been most encouraging in its recognition of the need to work with charities, especially in the early days, when the backlog of dormant accounts will have to be dealt with. As my noble friend Lord Hamilton said, to set up the suggested register would involve expense. As has been pointed out, while it may be self-financing, there will certainly be an initial cost that must be met from somewhere, and there will be running costs thereafter. </p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08022650000127"></a>It will be appreciated from the debate how much there is agreement on all sides about the Bill&#146;s central purposes, which are to ensure that dormant accounts are reunited with their rightful owners and, where they are not, that after a 15-year period, the resources will be devoted to public advantage. There is not a single noble Lord who has spoken in this debate who has not subscribed to those objectives; all noble Lords have added a great deal of colour and emotion and emphasised the fact that some of the good from the development of this work will involve advantage to charities. The Government recognise the powerful statements made by the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord Walton, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter on the advantages of charities&#151;the roles that they play in our society. I make it absolutely  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_566"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 566</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clear that nothing that I say about the amendment is in any way critical of the objective that charities, which do so much good for the public, should have opportunities for the enhancement of their resources. </p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08022650000128"></a>The first objective is how we ensure that account holders are reunited with their property so that only genuinely dormant accounts are transferred to the scheme. That is right and fair to customers; after all, it is their money which is the subject of this debate. Of course, a result of the reunification of accounts with customers will ultimately mean a reduction in the administrative costs of the reclaim fund, otherwise the reclaim fund, in certain cases, will be obliged to repay customer reclaims at a later date. That is bound to involve administrative costs, which will, therefore, reduce the amount of money available to benefit the public.</p>

<a name="80226-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08022650000129"></a>What is the effective and proportionate response? The noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, may be thought to be a lone voice on these issues today, but he was concerned in Committee about proportionate response; he is also concerned about confidentiality and the administration of the scheme. Those are also the proper concerns of Government. We have emphasised throughout the debate, today and in the earlier proceedings on the Bill, that the banking and building society sector and National Savings and Investments should take the lead in reuniting customers with their accounts prior to the launch of the scheme. The industry should put in place extensive and robust arrangements for continuing that work after the scheme is up and running.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08022650000130"></a>We are very encouraged by the work that has been done over this period. We welcome the bank and building society sector's ongoing commitment, as set out in the Statement of 8 November, to a major reuniting exercise ahead of the scheme&#146;s launch. The launch of www.mylostaccount.org.uk by National Savings and Investments, the British Bankers&#146; Association and the Building Societies Association is a central part of that work. It is a free, cross-industry, one-stop shop for customers attempting to locate their lost accounts. In less than a month since its launch on 30 January, it has received more than 140,000 hits and, importantly, has led to more than 72,000 submitted claims for lost accounts.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08022650000131"></a>That facility allows not just account holders but also executors and nominated representatives to initiate a search for a lost account. Executors and personal representatives will be able to search for lost accounts using the one-stop shop website which should help those entitled to legacy income to receive it because the executors will be working under the instructions of the person making the bequests. The advantage from this process is bound to accrue to charities where the intention was that bequests should be made to them.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08022650000132"></a>The Government also welcome the public announcement on 8 November confirming, additionally, the commitment to proactive searching by individual institutions. The public progress made by such significant institutions as Halifax and Nationwide is to be welcomed. The Government look forward to other substantial financial institutions meeting the commitment through

Of course, we welcome all constructive suggestions about how reuniting arrangements might be improved.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08022650000203"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08022650000133"></a>Is the central register, mandated through regulation, necessary or proportionate now or in the future? I note that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, welcomed it on the grounds that it was a sword of Damocles, but as I recall, that was an ever-present and continuing threat to people holding positions of power. That may be a salutary thing to look forward to, but on this particular sword of Damocles being backed by the noble Lord, it is expected to come into action. That is different from a threat. We are concerned to ensure that the industry makes the greatest efforts for the reunification of accounts. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, is entitled to carry the threat one stage further if it does not. I may have responded in a slightly jocular way, but it raises the central issue of the Bill that it is essentially a voluntary arrangement by the banks and building societies. They are expected to make an enormous contribution to this initiative through their activity. It is not an exercise in government regulation.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08022650000134"></a>Of course the Government have a role to play in this Bill, as we have previously discussed. That is different from saying that whenever it can be detected that matters in the Bill might be advanced with greater efficiency, that should be done through the strong arm of government. That is not the nature of the Bill. I do not agree that the central register mandated through regulation is either necessary or proportionate. It would involve extensive legislation to set it up. The register would need to be run, which would place an administrative burden on the resources that we are always talking about. They are resources related to the scheme that would otherwise go towards the benign purposes that have been identified by all sides of the House as the objectives of the scheme.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08022650000135"></a>There is a further difficulty. It would give the Government power to require data to be provided to a central source. That would not deal with how it would be enforced on the institutions, nor would the fact that banks and building societies&#151;again I turn to the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, who has expressed a view that is also held in other parts of the House&#151;are subject to confidentiality requirements on customer information. A bank account is a private contract and confidentiality issues are raised by the concept that banks can be compelled to breach them&#151;the sword of Damocles being translated into action, if the amendment were accepted. Transferring such information to a central source would mean that banks and building societies had to breach that confidentiality. It is difficult to see how that is compatible with the framework of law on confidential information and data protection that applies in the United Kingdom. It might also raise human rights issues. Although the Government considered every angle with regard to the proposed legislation, the issue of human rights was not raised, but the House will be all too well aware of the fact that Ministers are obliged to sign a document indicating that human rights are not contravened by legislation.  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_568"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 568</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We may have had trouble signing that if we had introduced a Bill carrying this concept. That is a difficulty for us.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08022650000136"></a>As a result of the amendment passed last time, the Bill now includes a clause requiring regular reports to Parliament on a range of issues, including banks&#146; and building societies&#146; arrangements to trace accounts and repay customers. The same clause asks the Government to consider improvements to the scheme at a later date. The Government intend to carry out a post-implementation review of the scheme, as I have made clear all along. We always appreciated that we would have to form an evaluation of the success of the scheme after it had been launched.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08022650000137"></a>However, I have real concerns about the review proposed in the amended Bill, requiring the Government to report on the scheme every three years in perpetuity. Every three years for 10, 20 or 50 years hence seems somewhat unnecessary. I cannot think of a precedent, nor has any noble Lord suggested one since this concept was introduced. I am also concerned about the detail and scope of the review as set out in the Bill and the implications for the scheme. So the Government will be seriously looking at these issues when the Bill moves from this place.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08022650000138"></a>However, I ask the House to appreciate that an underpinning principle of the Bill is voluntarism. It is not a government Bill in that respect, which would actually involve government direction in every element. A great deal of the Bill involves the willing participation&#151;in fact, the instigation of action, which they have already done&#151;of the banks and building societies. That this why we have taken care to move forward with respect for that element of voluntarism in the Bill. There are real problems with confidentiality and the extent to which power is handed to government in circumstances in which it may be looked upon as excessive in the context of the banks&#146; and building societies&#146; work in this area.</p>

<a name="80226-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08022650000139"></a>Not that I would want to reduce the just flow of resources to the benign institutions that have been the subject of so many representations from all sides of the House in any way, shape or form. Of course the Government want the scheme to work well. Without the slightest doubt, this will mean that where individuals have sought to make bequests to charity but their accounts have become dormant, this level of activity&#151;the work under the Bill and the voluntary work of the banks and building societies&#151;will benefit charities. But that is different from introducing a compulsory element, which raises issues of confidentiality and possibly human rights. In the Government&#146;s view, it is therefore a step too far. That is the basis of the Government&#146;s argument for asking the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I remind the House that I am calling for a reserve power only, not creating a statutory arrangement in the Bill.

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;Mr Speaker, I wish to make a Statement on casino policy. Today I am laying a draft order identifying 16 local authorities which will be authorised to license the eight large and eight small casinos permitted by the Gambling Act 2005. I do not intend to authorise a regional casino. My right honourable friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood established the independent Casino Advisory Panel to advise on the location of the 17 new casinos permitted by the Act. The panel considered applications from 68 local authorities and made its recommendations after detailed consideration.&#147;Before I make further progress, the House will want to know that since we last discussed these matters, the chair of the independent panel, Professor Stephen Crow, has passed away. I hope the whole House will join me in sending our condolences to his family and paying tribute to the integrity and dedication he brought to his role. &#147;Last March, an order incorporating the panel&#146;s recommendations was defeated in another place. Since then the Government have reflected on the range of views expressed in both Houses and beyond. There was a consensus that the eight large and eight small casino licences should be awarded to the 16 licensing authorities identified by the independent Casino Advisory Panel. It was a view expressed by the opposition Front Bench and by their Lordships in their message to this House calling for the 16 to be incorporated into a fresh order. Following last year&#146;s local elections, my right honourable friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde invited all 16 councils to indicate whether it remained their wish to license a new casino. All 16 have requested inclusion in this new order.&#147;But there was and is no consensus on the question of a regional casino. There are important differences between the regional casino on the one hand and the large and small casinos on the other. The regional casino would have been allowed up to 1,250 unlimited stake and prize gaming machines, something not seen before in the United Kingdom. The large and small casinos would be allowed to offer 150 and 80 category B1 gaming machines respectively, with a minimum &#163;2 stake and &#163;4,000 prize. B1 machines are already in use in Britain today.&#147;There are two principal and independent reasons for my decision not to proceed with a regional casino. First, concerns were expressed in both Houses  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_572"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 572</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about the potential negative impact of a regional casino operating on the proposed scale. I have not seen anything to suggest that the will of Parliament has changed. Secondly, I have considered the evidence, both old and new, on the impact of regional casinos. This evidence, including the scoping study by Lancaster University which I am laying in the House today, points towards the uncertainty of the risks involved and does not dispel these anxieties.&#147;The Gambling Commission&#146;s prevalence study, published in September, highlights that problem gambling, although small, remains persistent. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government concludes that regional casinos are likely to have no, or only marginal, net benefits compared with other means of economic and social regeneration. In the light of this and the evidence about the uncertain levels of risks, I do not intend to authorise a regional casino. &#147;I know that my decision will disappoint many in Manchester, particularly east Manchester, one of the most deprived areas of the country. Taking forward the conclusions of the report published today, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will lead an ad hoc ministerial group to work with Manchester Council and its partners to identify and bring forward a range of regeneration alternatives. The group will produce its first report by the end of March. &#147;Considerable support has been expressed in both Houses for the regeneration of Blackpool. My right honourable friend has today announced a package of investment for the town worth close to &#163;300 million. &#147;I seek the consent of the House to authorise eight small and eight large casinos because I am satisfied that they do not pose the same level of risk to the public as a regional casino. That said, my instinct is to proceed with caution, at all times considering measures to protect young and vulnerable people.Therefore, any new casinos authorised by this order will be required to abide by strict new rules, including providing non-gambling areas where customers can take a break from gambling; prohibiting the provision of free drinks to customers while they are gambling; prohibiting the use of credit cards to purchase chips or play gaming machines; ensuring any cash machines are located away from gaming areas; and requiring casinos to have policies to identify problem gamblers and provide information about support for addiction. Operators who break these rules risk losing their licence, fines and up to 51 weeks&#146; imprisonment. &#147;Taken together these measures make up the toughest regulatory controls for gambling in the world, but today I signal my intention to go further still. Regulators, legislators, operators and owners all have a duty to act in a socially responsible manner, accepting that, for some, gambling is an addiction, not a leisure pursuit. &#147;I was surprised to find that only 360 out of 3,800 licensed operators have so far this year made contributions to the Responsibility in Gambling

This is not acceptable. Promises were made and I expect them to be kept. The Archbishop of Canterbury has called for the introduction of a statutory levy. Unless the industry delivers a substantial increase in contributions by the end of this year, and makes contributions in a timely fashion, I will seek the approval of this House for a statutory levy, at a rate to be determined.&#147;Secondly, I believe that it is a good principle that all casinos are subject to a period of closure every day, when individuals are required to leave the premises. Currently,casinos are prevented from offering gambling over 24 hours unless they apply to local authorities for an extension, but I wish to rule out the possibility that some may remain open round the clock by requiring them to close their doors for at least six hours &#147;In conclusion, the order we are laying today is an enabling order giving 16 local authorities the ability to proceed with plans for small and large casinos. Whether to do so is entirely a matter for local decision, and I hope that local people will be consulted and involved at all stages. Small and large casinos will bring local economic benefits and provide enabling development with the potential to create new community facilities. But as the Lancaster study concludes, there are costs and benefits of casino development that need to be weighed in the balance. That is why I shall at all times proceed with caution and continue to keep gambling policy under review according to my responsibilities under the Act, to take advice from the Gambling Commission and to be guided by the evidence. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.

Those who want to have a bet can easily do so. Inevitably, if there are more casinos, with more promotion and more publicity, a number of people will start to gamble who might never have done so. Of that number a proportion will end up as addicted gamblers, with the consequent ruination of their and their families&#146; lives. I find it difficult to understand, if it is not right to permit a large casino because of the new evidence of risk, why it should be right to permit a collection of other casinos. Does the risk suddenly disappear because the premises are smaller? I find that difficult to believe. Steps are proposed to control problem gambling and they are welcome. Only time will tell whether they turn out to be adequate to prevent problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08022650000152"></a>I thank the Minister for the Statement, and I am sorry to learn of the death of Professor Crow. I send my condolences to his family. That respect and sadness, however, do not remove my original assessment that the findings of the panel he chaired were bizarre and based on criteria that ran contrary to those established by the Joint Committee set up by both these Houses. I do not blame Professor Crow or his colleagues, though; blame lies with Ministers, who have been buffeted hither and thither by press campaigns and well financed lobbies. Millions of pounds of public money have been wasted by commissioning inquiries about matters that should have been for ministerial judgment and the decision of Parliament. As it is, we have a gambling reform that gives us the worst outcomes of deregulation with few of its benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08022650000153"></a>Will the Minister confirm that, in addition to the 60 new casinos he has sanctioned, there are about 125 applications for casinos under the 1968 Act, and that the final number of casinos we are likely to have in this country when this exercise is finished will be nearer 300? Is he aware that we are about to have an explosion of small and medium-sized casinos, most of them in locations that are more likely to create the addiction and social problems that the Government are supposed to fear? The Prime Minister rushed to make a Statement about the super-casino to show his new moral compass&#151;but which way is that compass pointing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08022650000154"></a>What kind of world do Ministers live in? Have they ever been in a betting shop? I recently drove through Hoddeston, one of the poorest parts of London, on a Saturday night. Every betting shop was open, not for horseracing, but because under this legislation those shops can install four gaming machines each and stay open until 9.30 pm. So while the Prime Minister has been agonising over 1,250 machines in a single, strictly controlled and well policed super-casino, literally thousands are now available around the country. On another front, have Ministers seen the Economic and Social Research Council report, <I>Britain in 2008</I>? It says that there are now 2,300 gambling websites and that the internet is one of the fastest growing forms of betting. Three hundred casinos, tens of thousands of betting office terminals and 2,300 gambling websites&#151;but never fear, Blackpool has been saved by the Prime Minister from the moral degradation of a super-casino.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08022650000155"></a>Is the Minister aware that what has been saved for Blackpool is &#147;Coral Island&#148;&#151;a gambling shed on the Golden Mile owned by the Noble Organisation, a Gateshead company which funded much of the anti-super-casino campaign? Perhaps I may quote what one commentator said about the Noble Organisation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08022650000182"></a>&#147;Their position is only to secure Coral Island&#146;s foothold in Blackpool, meaning minimal investment and maximum return for the arcade&#148;.</p>

During a six-year period the Government&#146;s policy on super-casinos has swung from having an unlimited number, to eight, to two, to one, to none. Do the Government have any plans to compensate the 60-odd councils that spent large sums on bids that were wasted because of government incompetence? Given the rapid expansion of casino numbers envisaged, have the Government made an up-to-date assessment of policing needs in terms of the capabilities of the new Gambling Commission and of the local police forces that will have to deal with these new casinos?</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08022650000158"></a>The Minister mentioned local decision-making. What guidance do the Government intend to give to local authorities to deal with what, for many of them, will be an entirely new problem? I note that the Minister announced a &#163;300 million package of assistance for Blackpool, but is he aware that the Government have a long record of double accounting and of recycling old announcements and supplying candy floss promises in lieu of hard cash? So while Blackpool has never rested on its laurels and has been doing a tremendous amount of work through its task force, will he excuse any plaudits from me until it has had a chance to read the small print of this offer? However, I am sure that Blackpool has the energy and initiative to create a 21st century resort.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08022650000159"></a>Finally, is the Minister aware that the Gaming Act 1968 was a response to a clear and present danger of Mafia infiltration into our gambling industry? That legislation stood for 40 years as a byword and guarantor of probity and an example of sound legislation. In attempting to replace it, the Government have shown a degree of vacillation, ignorance, incompetence and cowardice that will make this an exercise which PhD students use in coming years for dissertations on how not to legislate.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Howard, was short, snappy and spoke with precision, whereas the noble Lord, Lord McNally, indulged in considerable rhetoric and asked a plethora of questions, to which I shall do my very best to respond, although my response may seem a little imbalanced.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08022650000161"></a>It will be appreciated across the House that the Statement represents the Government listening to informed opinion on the regional casino expressed in wider society and in both Houses of Parliament. That is why that issue is being dropped. The regional casino is vastly different from the small and large casinos referred to in the Statement. The regional casino was on a very significant scale, with more than 1,000 gaming machines permitted, whereas the restriction on the small and large casinos allows for less than a tenth of that. It will be appreciated, therefore, that we are talking about different scales of opportunities for casinos once the regional casino proposal has been withdrawn.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08022650000162"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard, said that there were no restrictions on people having a bet and asked

It would be somewhat surprising if betting and betting provision stood still when society is subject to significant change. People expect rather better facilities than those provided in the tiny betting shop with, at its most basic, virtually no facilities. People are lucky if they can find the door, let alone any facility within, except some fairly limited service across the counter. Of course people expect to be able to gamble in more civilised circumstances. That surely must be an advantage. We expect all our leisure pursuits, and indeed other pursuits, to be conducted in rather more favourable public circumstances than we did 30, 40 or 50 years ago, when the country did not have the resources that it has now.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08022650000163"></a>A function of increased disposable income will be that increased numbers of people will feel that they are prepared to wager. It is quite clear from the dimmest days of the 1930s that there was not much wagering going on when people did not have enough money to keep the bare necessities going. It is bound to be different in the year of grace 2008 and beyond, when there are greater resources.</p>

I ask noble Lords to consider that, in a society of greater resources, betting is a leisure pursuit that is likely to increase. What is important is that betting should be controlled so that the young and the vulnerable are not subject to the blandishments of the industry. Of course, we made it quite clear that we intend to follow that rubric. This Statement is a clear indication of how careful we intend to be on that matter.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08022650000166"></a>I have the greatest difficulty in recognising the size of the figures given by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, about the position under the 1968 Act. He will recognise that, while there may be applications, the realisation of casinos is somewhat different. There have been only a very small number of new casinos under the 1968 Act. There are a significant number of casinos&#151;more than 130&#151;but the number has increased only by a small amount and that was before the Government ever approached this legislation. It is not related to this legislation at all. The applications must be considered by local authorities and then translated into reality. The rate at which new casinos, under the 1968 Act, are growing at present is very low indeed. The noble Lord used the word &#147;applications&#148;; what is important is how many are actually created.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08022650000167"></a>The noble Lord also talked about the development of gaming machines in betting shops. He will recognise, first, that this is subject to restrictions on numbers and, secondly, that shops&#146; hours are restricted. Betting in betting shops is the subject of stringent legislation. As I maintain, betting shops have sought to diversify beyond the rather primitive services that they offered in the past. The important thing, which we should be secure about, is that they are regulated and that they do not promote addiction to gambling. That is also why, with regard to the casinos, my noble friend is contemplating the necessary breaks so that people do not stay within the casino for a full 24 hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08022650000168"></a>The noble Lord referred to Blackpool and Coral Island. The House will recall that the noble Lord was vocal in his advocacy that Blackpool should be four-square with Manchester in the provision of any large casino. Now he is lamenting the consequence that Blackpool does not have one, but he is also bound to realise that there is an issue about the failure of the Manchester position. That is why the Government are concerned to meet Manchester&#146;s regeneration costs and are prepared to put resources in.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08022650000169"></a>The noble Lord was somewhat ungenerous when he suggested that the fact that the Government are prepared to allocate &#163;300 million to Blackpool for regeneration should readily be criticised. Why so? Every seaside town in Britain has lamented the fact that, due to changing social patterns over the past 20 to 30 years, they have experienced a substantial decline as more British holidaymakers go abroad or elsewhere. Here is tangible, real money to support the regeneration of Blackpool. It is much needed support, which the local authority has campaigned for. I know that the noble Lord prides himself on his Blackpool commitments. Does he think that Members of Parliament in the other place for Blackpool and areas close to it will take the same view of these increased resources as he has done and suggest that they are of relatively little value? Far from it.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08022650000170"></a>Finally, the noble Lord suggested that people who put in bids ought to be compensated by the Government because of government incompetence. Let us be clear about the position. Even when the number of casinos was clearly identified as being limited, local authorities were concerned to put in those bids. Of course, I respect opinion in this House and I respect the view of this House, but we should also respect the fact that local authorities are elected and have the right to make decisions in their communities. That is what they did when they submitted their bids.</p>

In many cases, people who gamble can, of course, well afford it; as far as I am concerned, they have a right in law and a moral right to do exactly that.

He said that he wanted Britain to become the world leader in online gambling. The Government are at every step encouraging gambling. The Joint Parliamentary Committee that discussed this stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08022661000252"></a>&#147;Almost all the evidence we have received points to the fact that this legislation would increase the number of people in the United Kingdom with a gambling problem&#148;.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08022661000004"></a>We are saying that the more casinos we have, the greater the problem will become. Mrs Jowell, who was the Minister at that time, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08022661000253"></a>&#147;I do not accept that it will lead to an increase&#148;&#151;</p>

It is all right for the noble Lord to make the contention, but in fact there is no proof that problem gambling is increasing. I quoted the benchmark figure that shows no increase over the past eight years. We have given a pledge that if we do see that figure moving up, and problem gambling increases, we will act. That was the burden of the Secretary of State&#146;s remarks today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08022661000008"></a>The Government sought to take a strong position on online gambling and the noble Lord must consider the alternative. We have the strictest gambling legislation among developed countries. If online gambling goes to small political societies with very limited controls, that gambling becomes free of any restriction and law. We were arguing that we should set out as far as possible to make sure that online gambling was located in the United Kingdom where we could protect the vulnerable and the young and we could have some control of it. Of course, the House will recognise our limited success in that respect&#151;but that was the objective.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08022661000009"></a>On the question of the Government giving a moral lead, I am not sure that Governments are always equipped to give moral leads in any case, but the noble Lord will recognise that with regard to gambling the Government are creating legislation to make sure that the vulnerable and the young are protected. It is not the Government&#146;s business to tell a sophisticated society just how much it should gamble.</p>

Can he say how much money each year is gambled in those casinos and how much the Government estimate would be gambled per year in the 16 casinos he mentioned today?</p>

A lot of the casinos established under the 1968 Act have been operating for a long time. They are small operations with very limited facilities and so produce very limited amounts of resources. Local authorities regarded the eight large and eight small casinos as opportunities for regeneration because they would provide larger facilities than the majority of those set up under the previous legislation. The problem with those set up under the previous legislation is that they are not subject to the degree of control that the 16 new casinos will be subject to. That is why the development of these casinos is a result of our legislation to tighten up the necessary controls to restrict the development of problem gambling.</p>

It is not very often that I agree with the Minister but I do agree with him that the number of casinos mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is way beyond the scale of anything I understand. I want to commend the Minister on not allowing casinos to remain open 24 hours a day. I also wish to commend him in relation to free alcohol not being served at the tables, which is something I opposed for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08022661000013"></a>However, in Manchester more than 3,000 jobs have been lost as a result of this legislation. How much money does the Minister think might have been lost in levy and in taxation? Perhaps I may also say&#151;the Minister mentioned it and I agree with him&#151;that the incidence of problem gambling is lower in Britain than in any other developed country and lower than in any other gambling country anywhere in the world. Has the Minister considered the loss of employment?

We have faith that having, clearly revealed the figures, the industry will shape up. We are also quite clear that if it does not, we will take appropriate action. The noble Lord referred to making sure that people are not in the casino 24 hours a day with free drinks at the table. There is work to be done in that respect. The Minister was indicating today that these were areas in which he was contemplating action. We will require developments on that.</p>

<a name="80226-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08022661000015"></a>The Minister also announced today that Ministers were addressing themselves to Manchester. Anyone familiar with that great city will know that a substantial part of east Manchester, not too far from the city centre, is a completely blighted wasteland following the destruction of the vast largely engineering works which were the glory of Manchester for a century and a half. That area needs redevelopment. Although Manchester has a proud record of very significant redevelopment in parts of the city, the east Manchester project did involve the regional casino. That is a loss of investment for Manchester and a loss of development and jobs, as the noble Lord rightly identified. That is why Ministers are going to Manchester to address themselves to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08022661000017"></a>My second request is to ask whether there is really any reason why a compulsory levy is not applied as from now, given the tiny proportion of contributions that have been made to the Responsibility in Gambling Trust. Clearly, the money will be needed. It has been specifically explained that without doubt the number of problem gamblers will grow; from my knowledge, I support that view.</p>

<a name="80226-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08022661000018"></a>My third question is very brief. I agree that it is a good idea that the eight larger and eight small casinos should be shut for a number of hours during the day. The Minister said that a room will be set aside where there will be no gambling. Can we have guarantees that there will be no machines there that children might begin to become addicted to?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08022661000021"></a>Does the Minister recognise that the threat to GamCare, in particular, as the largest recipient of funds from the industry through the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, is much more urgent than is recognised in the Statement? The Statement says that if nothing happens by the end of the year, a compulsory levy will be imposed. However, at their meeting on Friday, the RIGT trustees will restrict the funds of GamCare to below that which we have asked for and below that which was agreed 18 months ago in a three-year programme. Unless something is done much more quickly than by the end of the year, those who are responsible for treatment and counselling will have to be laid off and the service will not be provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08022661000028"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is proposed by the Standing Committee on Justice, a coalition of all the principal charities that work with children. It seeks to introduce a requirement for local authorities and the courts to consider appropriate local authority provision to meet the needs of an offender under the age of 18, when custody is being considered. Local authorities are, as the Committee will be aware, under a statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need. Is there a need for the court to determine whether further service provision by a local authority could avoid having to send into custody a child under the age of 18, or is it just lip service to say that custody should be the last resort for children, as required by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08022661000029"></a>It is interesting and instructive to illustrate the problem by consideration of looked-after children. A project was carried out by the National Children&#146;s Bureau which produced a report entitled <I>Tell Them Not To Forget About Us</I>. In that report the bureau found that looked-after children who enter prison often miss out and have missed out on the support and care planning services to which they are entitled. As a result of not having those services, their long-term outcomes are very poor. The National Children&#146;s Bureau was commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills to look at the care planning system for looked-after children in prison. Di Hart, the principal

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="08022661000269"></a>&#147;The picture that emerged was one of fragmented planning and poor outcomes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000234"></a>Young people often feel abandoned by the social workers on whom they have come to rely and practitioners are confused about their respective responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80226-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08022661000030"></a>In the report of the National Children&#146;s Bureau, there is a foreword, written by Maria Eagle, who is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for children and families, and Rob Morgan, who is the chair of the Youth Justice Board. The foreword says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="08022661000270"></a>&#147;The Government is committed to supporting effective multi-agency working to help support all children and young people, and to improve the outcomes they achieve in life. It is crucial that children do not fall between agencies, and that each agency works as effectively as it can with the others involved in that child&#146;s life. That means getting the right systems in place to facilitate this, and not to hinder it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000235"></a>The foreword continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08022661000271"></a>&#147;For the small number of looked after young people and care-leavers who are sentenced to custody, it is particularly important that the local authority children&#146;s services fit seamlessly with the way the youth justice system operates&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000236"></a>In that foreword there is recognition of the problem that this amendment seeks to address. It is important to consider the looked-after children because 46 per cent of children in prison are or have been in care. Although they are entitled to ongoing social work support when in prison, there are few systems to ensure that they receive the help that they need to plan effectively for release.</p>

<a name="80226-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08022661000031"></a>With that introduction, I take Members of the Committee to Amendment No. 79 and to the proposals that we have included for a new Section 156A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>

<p><a name="08022661000237"></a>The new section states:</p>

If I say that it is more straightforward than that tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, I am in no way disparaging his contribution, which is extremely important. Our amendment underlines the importance of a pre-sentence report being in writing. It would ensure that the court considers the individual circumstances of the offender, such as his home situation, health, education and the history&#151;if there is one&#151;of his offending behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08022661000035"></a>The JCHR emphasised the need to ensure that those requirements are clearly set out and that conclusions drawn from them are closely tailored to the individual circumstances of the offender. A report in writing would mean that a clear and detailed record could be kept on the child&#146;s file further to inform any later appearance before the court. I confess that I had assumed that these pre-sentence reports would always be in writing, but I understand that oral reports can be compiled quickly in the courthouse and given in court on the same day by the YOT officer. That is an exceedingly unattractive and ill advised approach, which is why we tabled the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08022661000037"></a>It is an extremely grave step to consider a custodial sentence for a child, and never lightly to be undertaken. At the same time, however, one must remember the immense pressures under which sentencers sometimes operate. As the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury has again reminded us today in some sensible and sane observations, we must be wary lest we are moving into a culture of studied hostility towards the young which is actually provoking anxiety among them, resulting in anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08022661000038"></a>In this context, with much of the media baying for &#147;tough&#148; lines, one cannot underestimate the psychological situation in which sentencers sometimes find themselves. The tough line is sometimes to resist popular pressure and do what is necessary. It may not be popular, but it may be what is right and make sense in terms of the individual, their rehabilitation, the interests of society and the avoidance of further cost through further offending.</p>

<a name="80226-0006.htm_para15"></a>

As I argued on an earlier amendment, whenever this is necessary it should always be in tailor-made, specific accommodation established for the young. The evidence is repeatedly there, month after month, of how things go wrong for the young in prisons. They are in situations where the culture is totally wrong and does not concentrate on the child as a child&#151;however terrible what the child may have done&#151;or on the need to try to enable them to rebuild a sane, balanced life. Suicide, self-mutilation and everything else that goes on is all appalling evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08022661000040"></a>In this context, therefore, to call for detailed consideration and ask for those who know most about the child and their record to be present, and to seriously record in writing what their views, experiences and analysis amount to, is altogether appropriate and relevant. Both of these amendments are self-evidently sensible. They would strengthen the purposes of the Bill and, from that standpoint, I am glad to support them.</p>

Does that figure not say something quite enormous: that our care system is seriously wrong and not functioning properly? Or am I jumping from the particular to the general, or whichever way around it is, without any great degree of logical thought? However, on first sight, those numbers strike me as extremely disturbing. The care system itself must therefore now be carefully looked into to see what improvements can be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08022661000042"></a>It is also extremely odd that this is not already in practice. It is blindingly obvious to any person of humanity or common sense that sending children to prison or a lock-up should automatically be the last resort. It is incomprehensible in today&#146;s world that there is no proper written report on every child before that child is sent to prison. Of course I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that some children are thoroughly nasty, very dangerous and particularly repellent, and should be locked up. However, that equally induces a responsibility on society that the care standard, not only from the child&#146;s point of view but from society&#146;s, should be the best that we can possibly organise. The more efficient we are and the better we are at organising care for young criminal offenders, the more they will not go on, as so many of the bad ones do, to a complete life of crime. That is what we should be aiming for. Of course it is impossible to succeed, but at least I hope that we can make some dent in it. The amendments go a tiny way to making a pinprick in this thing, so I support them wholeheartedly.</p>

If it is necessary to send a child to secure accommodation or a young person under 18 to prison, that, as the Government have already said, is a measure of last resort.

Indeed, the background may have some effect on what the prison sentence may be. Consequently, the idea that it is possible to send a young person to prison on a report that is provided on the day of his being found guilty but is not considered is a blot on our administration of justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08022661000045"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, mentioned care, which links again&#151;I have paid attention to this in the past&#151;to the Children and Young Persons Bill, which has been going through in a parallel time. I am particularly keen on the provisions that would be made by the amendment to require local authorities to produce an overview from the people responsible for the care of a child to aid those people who have to take the sentencing step. I was, like the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, disturbed to see the comments about this proposal when it was made in the other place. The Minister there said that it would duplicate existing safeguards and provisions in respect of information about the young offender and would impose additional bureaucracy and cost, particularly on local authorities, for little extra gain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08022661000046"></a>From the very beginning of our discussions on the youth justice part of the Bill, people on all sides of the House have emphasised that the focus must be on the child. It seems to me that the Minister did not focus on the child so much as on the bureaucrats and the authority. You cannot have too many safeguards to make certain that the best interests of the child are preserved. I am, frankly, astonished that the Minister should think that that was a line to take.</p>

Of course, we should put the requirements to deal with the child at the very top of our priorities, not at the bottom of the list. Therefore, I hope very much that these amendments, which are designed to do just that and to make certain that the best interests of the child are not only maintained but recorded so that they can be followed through by others and not just be a one-stop shop when someone appears in court, are taken very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08022661000051"></a>As I pointed out at Second Reading, while the Government pay lip service to all manner of good intentions where sentencing is concerned&#151;for example, using custody only as a very last resort and for as short a time as possible; the welfare of the child being paramount; and supporting the preference for community-based penalties wherever possible&#151;the reality is quite at odds with those sentiments. While overall crime is dropping, the number of children being sent into custody continues to rise. Child prisons are by definition punishment rather than welfare based. Here, the STCs as well as the YOIs take children as young as 12 years-old. The budgets for the providers of the vital alternatives for young people in the community are being cut, thus limiting available resources.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08022661000052"></a>Under the amendment, local authorities are required to consider all available alternatives. That is the way to meet the obligations, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has just told us, of putting the welfare of the child first, of finding alternatives to custody except as a last resort and of the Government making available resources for appropriate provision.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08022661000053"></a>It is by now well known that children for whom custody is being considered are the most needy, most vulnerable and most damaged. Eighty per cent of the youngest children reoffend, the costs of custody are huge, and if their needs are appropriately met&#151;for example, 60 per cent of boys have serious mental health problems&#151;we will have a safer society, and less socially and mentally disabled children. We will also, incidentally, have complied with our obligations under Articles 37(b) and 40.4 of the UNCRC and Rule 19.1 of the Bejing rules, which would be no bad thing. It always defeats me how we somehow manage to sidestep, avoid or ignore these rules to which we should adhere and with which we should comply.</p>

The issue is not only bureaucracy, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, pointed out, it is also often cash. Local authorities lack a financial incentive; for example, individual support orders are not nearly as popular as ASBOs. Even, very sadly, the YOTs have become quite distanced from the work of children&#146;s services, something which was commented on in a chief inspector&#146;s report on safeguarding in 2002. Pre-sentence reports are vital. I urge the Government to look carefully at these important amendments carefully.</p>

I certainly bow to the view of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, that the vast majority of courts have over the years approached these issues in this way and sentences have spelt out the very things in Amendment No. 79. It may be that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is placing a rather narrow gloss on the words of the Minister in the Standing Committee, but I have not read his speech and I may be wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08022661000056"></a>If that Minister was suggesting for a moment that financial economies were more important than the future of a child, I would wholeheartedly agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said. I suspect, however, that that is not what was meant. In other words, the Minister was applying his mind here to the question of the local authority&#146;s involvement. Was it necessary for the local authority to be represented in court when the probation officer, presumably, would have already consulted the local authority and would be able to speak for it in an authoritative way? If it was the latter, the Minister should be absolved from what clearly otherwise would be a very narrow and improper analysis of the situation.</p>

On Amendment No. 79, quite apart from the specific reference, and possibly unnecessary reference, to the local authority as such, it seems to me that that can be dealt with to a large extent by administrative precept. I suspect that it probably is dealt with already by administrative precept in that regard. All that one needs is in Amendment No. 80. Very few courts would ever proceed to sentencing a person under the age of 18 to custody without a written report. Sometimes, reports need not be written, but, almost invariably, the judge would ask the resident probation officer whether he or she would be so kind as to interview a person in circumstances where the learned judge very probably had already made up his or her mind not to exercise the assumption of custody in that case. I very much welcome Amendment No. 80 for the reasons that I have articulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08022661000059"></a>On the amendment tabled by my noble friend, this seems to be an open and shut case. If you are dealing with the question of whether to put a child under the age of 18 into custody, you are dealing with the question of whether to impose on him a step that will probably have a watershed effect in his subsequent life. Although I agree absolutely with what has just been said by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that there may be occasions when it will be possible properly to have a pre-sentence report given orally, it is a necessary safeguard to require that such reports are given in writing. Much will depend on the way in which the report is expressed. If it has to be in writing, one can be that much more sure that it will be carefully considered with an eye to the possible consequences of this or that nuance than if it is delivered orally. I therefore hope that the Government will support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

I was astounded to learn that children can be sent to prison without a written report and I wonder whether in his reply the Minister could confirm that that does happen. Most noble Lords would find it difficult to believe. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, opens up some of the contradictions that lie at the heart of the Government&#146;s policy. No doubt noble Lords will be aware that in most western European countries, and in England and Wales until the recent past, children in trouble are dealt with by the same authorities as other children with problems. Those are the local authorities, which have responsibility for all services for children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08022661000061"></a>The Government recently reformed the systems for dealing with children at the local level and have introduced what appear to be considerable improvements based on the ideas behind <I>Every Child Matters</I> and <I>S</I><I>afeguarding </I><I>C</I><I>hildren</I>. This is where the problems start. Once the actions of a child become of interest to the police, children are moved from mainstream services for children to the specialist world of youth offending teams, the courts and the Youth Justice Board. This structure leads to major dysfunction because it enables local services in the area where the child and the family live, and where the impact of the child&#146;s behaviour is felt, to opt out. The child&#146;s needs and the plan for the child become someone else&#146;s responsibility, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, pointed out, for a hard-pressed local authority that can be quite welcome. It can also be greatly to the authority&#146;s financial advantage to shift the spending responsibility to the Youth Justice Board&#146;s custody budget. This is, however, a highly undesirable and ineffective outcome because all the research shows us that the more a child can be kept in a local situation and within mainstream services, the more the aim of the youth justice system to reduce reoffending is likely to be met.</p>

The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, would be particularly effective after Clause 9 because it amplifies the importance of dealing with offenders under the age of 18. It is that which matters particularly to those of us who are also working on the Children and Young Persons Bill. We have heard about the proportion of those aged under 18 in custody who go on to reoffend, and it is absolutely appalling. But we also know that the Children and Young Persons Bill has been brought forward by the Government in response to a high degree of input and information from people like my noble friend Lord Listowel, who has been lobbying for a long time to draw attention to just how badly we have failed with this group of children. It is thoroughly to the Government&#146;s credit that they are doing their best to pass a Bill that pays far greater attention to the needs of these children.</p>

The proposal recalls for me a time when I sat as a chairman of a juvenile court where we certainly did take account not just of probation reports, but social services reports and reports from the education authority as well. Together, they formed the basis on which we would come to a conclusion. When dealing with children and young people, it is sensible for us as a country and as a community to do our best to rehabilitate them in the way suggested particularly in the Children and Young Persons Bill. I hope that the Minister will give real consideration to these two amendments.</p>

You become, in effect, a corporate parent for all of the children in local authority care. If one of those children was to die in your care, of course you would consider that you had failed substantially as a corporate parent, but I am not sure that the same feelings arise when a child in the care of a councillor as a corporate parent is sent to prison. However, in fact it is the same sort of substantial failure. In particular, the statutory requirement for a local authority to list the services it has provided to meet the needs of the child or young person would be a tool for corporate parents. I must say that as a councillor you are one step removed from these children. Obviously you cannot have the same level of involvement as a real parent would have, and you need to know that all the policies have been implemented and the paper trail is in place in order to ensure that failure is a remote possibility. Of course, excellent authorities do have this sort of thing in place, but not all authorities are excellent. Quite apart from all the reasons so powerfully put by other noble Lords, this provision would be an additional tool for local authorities to use.</p>

I am well aware of the very poor outcomes for looked-after children.

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that in arguing against the amendment, my colleague in another place was not referring to the needs of bureaucracies or to finance issues; he was concerned&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, suggested&#151;to ensure that there are clear lines of accountability and responsibility in what local authorities do, and concerned that if the amendment were accepted, the court&#146;s role may well have an impact on that.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08022661000068"></a>I was interested in the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who referred to excellent authorities and to not all local authorities being excellent. She suggested that the intervention of the courts as the amendment proposes may help to improve standards. The Government believe that the duties imposed by the existing legislation are satisfactory and that we need to focus our attention on how we can generally improve the performance of both youth offending teams and local authorities. There is no doubt, or argument between us, about that.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08022661000069"></a>Section 156 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 already requires the court to consider a pre-sentence report before giving a custodial sentence. It is undoubtedly important that the courts possess the fullest information in order to make their decisions and, as I said, to ensure that local authorities are discharging their responsibilities in accordance with their statutory duties. The pre-sentence report already covers most of the issues that the new clause seeks to introduce. I am concerned whether the Bill or the courts are the right way of holding local authorities to account for their actions in relation to vulnerable young people.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08022661000070"></a>It is critical that the courts should have thorough assessments of young people on which they can make proper and reasonable sentencing decisions. That is the underlying purpose of Section 156 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which provides that the court must consider a pre-sentence report if it is to impose a community order or custodial sentence. The content of the pre-sentence report is therefore vital. The information to be contained in such reports is set out in the National Standards for Youth Justice Services, which require youth offending teams to produce a thorough assessment of the young person. The pre-sentence report is supported by a common assessment profile of the young person, a comprehensive document  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_593"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 593</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which covers all the information that is set out in the new clause and more, including the offender&#146;s welfare background. By implication, it would need to include information on the level of engagement with local social services, what services have been used and any assessment of future need for local authority services.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08022661000071"></a>The right approach is to provide practitioners with the guidance set out by the Youth Justice Board. The guidance can remain flexible, be amended to reflect changes and be kept up to date. The national standards are currently being revised, and I can assure the Committee that we will highlight the need to ensure that welfare issues are included in the pre-sentence report process, that appropriate information is put before the court and that those requirements are established in national standards.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08022661000072"></a>The current national standards are relevant to our debate. Pre-sentence reports must be prepared in writing and copied to the young person, to their parents or guardian and to the prosecutor. They must include an analysis of the offence; an assessment of the young person; an assessment of risk to the community, including risk of re-offending and harm; and a recommendation on sentencing. A young person is assessed by means of a standard assessment tool, the information in which includes interviews with the young person, parents or guardian; existing reports, including any previous assessment; a statement of education needs; and any information relevant to offending including contact with police or health and children&#146;s services. It must take into account any child protection plan, pastoral support plan, individual education plan, care plan, children in need assessment, pathway plan or any other plans. It is then the responsibility of the youth offending team to obtain all the relevant information and to engage with other local authority services in establishing the young person&#146;s needs and ascertaining the best and most appropriate intervention.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08022661000073"></a>It might be interesting to mention the joint inspection of the YOTs. The annual report concluded that there were considerable strengths in current practice. In almost all pre-sentence reports the young people were interviewed at least once, in most cases with their parents or carers, and almost all reports included a clear proposal commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. However, the report also identified certain areas for improvement. For instance: some reports were not based on the assessment tool; safeguarding issues were identified in only 75 per cent of reports; and only 61 per cent of the reports paid attention to vulnerability. I make no apology for highlighting some of the weaknesses identified in the annual report. I am seeking to illustrate that there is a process of inspection, review and monitoring and that we expect youth offending teams to take note and make improvements to their services.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08022661000074"></a>The same applies to local authorities. Over the years there have been many instances where social services have not provided the right quality of service&#151;I remember making a Statement to this House in relation to Victoria Climbi&#233;. However, changes have been made. We have a new approach and strong accountability mechanism that includes an ability to intervene. Some years ago Birmingham, my own local authority, performed  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_594"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 594</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very poorly in social services and had to go into special measures. The result of the intervention was that Birmingham improved its overall performance and came out of those measures.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08022661000075"></a>I am not going to say that everything is perfect and I understand that the quality of the local authorities&#146; work can sometimes frustrate the courts and have a negative impact on the young people we are discussing. The best way of approaching the issue is to say that alongside the requirement in the reports prepared by the youth offending teams there should be a performance-management regime, a clear expectation of standards and a clear intervention when the authorities or youth offending teams fail to produce the goods. That is the best way forward.</p>

I have said that the Youth Justice Board national standards already require pre-sentence reports to be in writing. Section 159 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 also requires that copies of the pre-sentence reports are made available to the offender, to the offender&#146;s parent or guardian if they are under 18 years old, and to the prosecutor. There is an exception, which is if the pre-sentence report is made orally to the court. For young people, that will be where the court decides it can deal with a case immediately rather than adjourn to obtain the report in writing.</p>

<a name="80226-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08022661000079"></a>I know noble Lords have expressed concern about that, but the provision of an oral report enables the court to allow a young person&#146;s case to be dealt with properly without the need to adjourn for a full report. I have been advised that the offences concerned will be minor. The example I have been given is of a shoplifting offence of a low-value item with no aggravating circumstances, such as drug abuse or minor criminal damage, and the youth offending team is content that a full report is not required and an oral report is appropriate.</p>

It is important that the court should bear that in mind when it is considering whether a young person should be sent to prison. We are concerned not about what a probation officer can offer but about what services provided by the local authority have been, or could be, used to avoid that final determination by the court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08022661000085"></a>If your Lordships look more closely at our amendment, you will see that we are not suggesting that the local authority should itself be under a duty to provide a report to the court but merely that the pre-sentence report includes information from the relevant local authority. In other words, the youth offending team that is putting the pre-sentence report together should have a paragraph or more in that report that outlines the local authority&#146;s attitude to the individual child or young person. That is really what we are concerned with; not the provision of more reports, but that the youth offending team should have that very much in mind. Although we have heard of the guidelines and the assessment tools, which seem admirable in themselves and which have been laid down for youth offending teams to utilise, the Minister has demonstrated that, according to the annual report, there are failures in the provision of the necessary information.</p>

I am not here to criticise local authorities or to ask the court to discipline them for the non-provision of services, nor to argue that youth offending teams should be disciplined for failing to follow the mechanisms, the assessment tool, with which they are provided. I argue that the court may not pass a custodial sentence, it will not send the child or young person to prison, unless it is satisfied, on information that has been obtained from the local authority&#151;through the youth offending team, no doubt&#151;that everything that that local authority could have done for the child or young person has been done.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08022661000088"></a>I also support the amendment that has been put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that everything should be in writing. The old way of working&#151;the probation officer going downstairs, having a chat with the individual young person in the cells and then coming back and giving some sort of a report that he has achieved mainly from the young person or possibly from his parents&#151;is simply not good enough. The court requires a wider provision; not just the probation officer&#146;s view but the local authority&#146;s input into what is the most appropriate way of dealing with that offender. While I am glad that there are the mechanisms to which the Minister has referred, the duty on the court must be to ensure that those points have been covered and not to take either an oral report or a written report simply at face value without asking, &#147;What have you done under this section to obtain the local authority&#146;s attitude?&#148;.</p>

The remainder of Part 2 contains specific sentencing proposals, some of which were considered in Committee in another place and some of which were introduced quite late in the day inspired by the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles. If I were a more cynical person I might suggest that some of these amendments owe a great deal more to the desire to reduce the scale of the prison population than they do to their inherent merits. However, I have no doubt that the Minister will have something to say about that.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_597"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 597</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80226-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08022661000095"></a>The first of these matters concerns the Government&#146;s desire to remove the power of magistrates to impose suspended sentences in summary cases. Clause 10 proposes that suspended sentences could not be ordered for summary offences although the power would remain for indictable and either-way offences. However, if two or more custodial sentences were being considered on the same occasion, one summary and one indictable, and it is intended to impose a suspended sentence for the indictable offence, a suspended sentence could then be imposed for one or more of the summary offences. As I understand it, this is the first time there has ever been a proposal which differentiates so radically in sentencing disposals between summary and either-way matters. Indeed, in many cases the distinction will almost be a distinction without a difference. For example, in matters of criminal damage, whether something is a summary matter or an either-way matter can turn on the financial scale of the cost of the damage.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08022661000096"></a>But the key issue that needs addressing under Clause 10 is this: when one is dealing with a suspended prison sentence, one is dealing with an offence that has passed the custody threshold. This flows from the guidelines of the Sentencing Guidelines Council. At page 24 of the guidance, the Sentencing Guidelines Council sets out the questions that the court should ask itself. First, has the custody threshold been passed? Secondly, if so, is it unavoidable that a custodial sentence be imposed? Thirdly, if so, can that sentence be suspended? So if the court concludes that a custodial sentence should be imposed and if the option of a suspended sentence is removed, as the Government so intend, it is inevitable that the person in the dock will be sent to prison. In my submission, removing the power of magistrates to use suspended sentences for summary offences will actually have the opposite effect to that the Government intend. It will increase the prison population, not reduce it. The suspended sentence provides flexibility that enables the magistrate to provide a sentencing option which will, always assuming that the individual concerned will stick to the terms of the licence, keep him out of prison.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08022661000097"></a>As I understand the Government&#146;s argument from reading the relevant passages in another place, their view is that what the court would normally do, if the option to issue a suspended sentence were removed, would be to impose a community sentence. If that is the Government&#146;s view, it flies in the face of the guidance given by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. So the Opposition believe that Clause 10 is misconceived and will have an effect contrary to the one the Government intend. We believe that the Government should think again.</p>

That echoed the words of that most splendid gentleman, the late Lord Allen of

I suspect that we still operate under that reality and that very probably all governments, whatever their problems, face much the same situation.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08022661000099"></a>As I am in anecdotal mood, I recount what happened in 1968 in the Home Office when it was discovered, after the Criminal Justice Act 1967 which introduced suspended sentences had run for 12 months&#151;I am not exactly sure of the figures but they must be very near exact&#151;that the number of fines had fallen by some 18,000 in that 12 months. The number of suspended sentences was either 19,000 or 17,000&#151;it was 1,000 one way or the other&#151;and with the greatest possibility of coincidence in the world, there must have been some causal connection between those two factors.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08022661000100"></a>The point that I seek to make is this. You can never be sure how courts will react to these situations, especially when you bear in mind that the courts which will be dealing with these matters day in and day out will mostly be magistrates&#146; courts. Noble Lords will know far better than I how two magistrates&#146; courts with adjoining petty sessional divisions and very similar social backgrounds will adopt totally different sentencing policies. Therefore, there is a danger that you will not get what you expect to get and what you wish to get with this clause. Magistrates may well say, &#147;We would like to fine this person but he has no money&#148;. For a number of reasons they may react against the alternative prospect of a community sentence and say, &#147;Very well, my lad, it&#146;s got to be prison in your case&#148;. So although you defend yourself against the danger that the subjects of suspended sentences may breach those sentences and end up in prison, other people will go to prison immediately.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08022661000101"></a>I believe that a suspended sentence for a comparatively minor offence can be very useful. When you look at the escalation over a person&#146;s criminal career, you say to yourself, &#147;What if he had been stopped early on? What might have happened if he had been pulled up with a short suspended sentence for a summary offence?&#148;. The consequences of losing that tool should be taken very much into consideration.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08022661000102"></a>My other point is the one made most elegantly by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. That is, it involves some logical gyroscopics to be able to bring about the situation. Before a sentencer determines that a matter is one for custodial sentence, he must determine whether the custodial threshold has been passed and custody is appropriate. Then he has to constitute himself into a parole board and say to himself that the man he decided, one second ago, to send to prison need not serve that sentence after all. Such mental athleticism and gymnastics are not what ordinary people would appreciate as being very sensible.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08022661000103"></a>It is done and I appreciate that, perhaps, in this case, the alternative to doing nothing to what is contained in Clause 10 might well be to issue very sound advice to magistrates&#146; courts. However, the logical track is still there. You are still inviting them to

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08022661000105"></a>What is the merit of the suspended sentence? It is surely that it enables the gravity of the offence to be marked, but at the same time offers the accused person the opportunity to avoid prison by reforming his behaviour. This is a very good thing for him and for the taxpayer. I cannot see the logic in keeping it as a sentencing tool for indictable offences, yet taking it away from the far more numerous summary-only offences. The point has already been made, but is worth alluding to again, that before a suspended sentence can become a possibility, the sentencing threshold, as defined by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, has to be passed. The consequence, then, will not be a community order sentence; it will be, in the vast majority of cases, an immediate custodial sentence. That renders this a stupid reform, and not one of those splendid ones, albeit that it will be introduced for the wrong reasons.</p>

The Committee should remember that a suspended sentence, for some people, is a very great punishment indeed. You have been sentenced to prison, but the sentence has been suspended. It is a great disincentive for some people to reoffend. To have a community sentence instead, if the Government think that is what will happen as a result of this clause, is not the same punishment. The public will see that; people know the difference between these things. In my experience, the suspended sentence is enormously effective for some people. Of course, many reoffend and despite a suspended sentence, they will go to prison. I see that, but for many that is not the case and we should not forget that.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="08022661000273"></a>&#147;It is part of the government&#146;s drive to examine how we can achieve greater use of community sentences&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee, 20/11/07; col. 332.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000242"></a>He was then asked, in effect, how he could be so sure about that. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="08022661000274"></a>&#147;My judgment, and that of the Lord Chancellor and his predecessor my noble Friend Lord Falconer, is that this will result not in up-tariffing to custody but in down-tariffing to more community sentences&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08022661000110"></a>He invents some new English phrases, but does not really give any reason. He then said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="08022661000275"></a>&#147;I believe it will result in stronger use of community sentences rather than going to automatic custody&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee, 20/11/07; col. 333.]</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08022661000112"></a>How does that follow? The court, before it even considers the suspension of sentence, has gone through what levels of sentence can be considered. It has concluded that it does not want an absolute discharge, a fine, or a community sentence, and that a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed. This clause abolishes the ability of the magistrates or judge to suspend that sentence. The only conclusion one can have is that immediate sentence of imprisonment should and will be imposed.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08022661000115"></a>These orders were introduced in April 2005. As we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, they enabled a court passing a sentence of imprisonment of less than 12 months to suspend that custodial sentence for a period of between six months and two years. These have been used extensively. In recent months, more than 3,500 per month have been given out by the courts, of which 40 per cent are for summary-only offences. However, at the same time as the rapid increase in the use of suspended sentences, there has been no drop of equivalent magnitude in custodial sentences. The view of the Government is that many of those sentenced to a suspended sentence order would previously have been sentenced to a non-custodial disposal.</p>

<a name="80226-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08022661000116"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, would say that that is a result of the Elystan-Morgan law of not getting what we expect. But, clearly, to merit a suspended sentence an offence should have reached the custody threshold. We think that as a result of the introduction of the suspended sentence order we have added about 400 places to the prison population, and that number will build up over about a two-year period from now. The reason for that is that those who breach suspended sentences are almost certain to go to prison, whereas breach of community orders has a wide range of consequences which do not necessarily end in custody. Therefore, we are concerned about the way in which the new suspended sentence has been used where we think a community disposal would previously have been deemed appropriate.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000243"></a>That is particularly true in the case of magistrates&#146; courts, which suggests that there is a grey area. It is in that grey area that the greater use of suspended sentences has fallen.</p>

Yes, I accept that, clearly, the issue of suspended sentences needs to be kept under discussion with the council. I understand that the council plans to review its guidelines on general seriousness and on the new sentences arising from the Criminal Justice Act 2003, so there will be an opportunity to look at suspended sentence issues again in relation to the custodial threshold.</p>

If that sentence is suspended, it is perhaps a great relief, but its meaning remains &#147;sentenced to prison&#148;. For Parliament to be asked to do away with probably one of the most valuable tools at present available to magistrates seems really foolish to me. The Government are making an enormous mistake, which will affect the public locally. When they see it happening, it will enormously trivialise the difference between the two sentences.

The Government&#146;s perfectly laudable motive is to diminish the number of persons who are sent to prison on the breach of a suspended sentence.

<a name="80226-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08022661000131"></a>Many people commit offences while they are the subject of suspended sentences, because there is little or no support for their position. As I understand it, the law, as it stands, is that below a certain level&#151;is it still 12 months or is it six months?&#151;no suspended sentence supervision order can be made. That meant that as far as magistrates were concerned there would be no such orders. To change that rule, and to bring the bar down to three months would, I appreciate, involve substantial human resources, which would have to be paid for in money and in human terms. Yet

However, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that there are issues of resources, priorities and appropriate use of the skills of probation officers. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s point: that an early intervention might be a better preventive approach and that the result of that would be fewer breaches of these orders and, therefore, fewer people going into prison.

It is necessary to go back to the guidance of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which says on page 24:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08022661000279"></a>&#147;The crucial difference is that the suspended sentence is a prison sentence and is appropriate only for an offence that passes the custody threshold and for which imprisonment is the only option&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000246"></a>The relevant questions from the guidance are:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08022661000280"></a>&#147;(a) has the custody threshold been passed? (b) if so, is it unavoidable that a custodial sentence be imposed?&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000247"></a>and</p>
<ul><a name="08022661000292"></a>&#147;(c) if so, can that sentence be suspended? (sentencers should be clear that they would have imposed a custodial sentence if the power to suspend had not been available)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000248"></a>Now, if the Government want to remove,</p>
<ul><a name="08022661000293"></a>&#147;if the power to suspend had not been available&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000249"></a>the answer is that the sentencer must impose a custodial sentence.</p>

Clearly, there will be circumstances in which some of the offenders will end up in custody even without the suspended sentence order. There is no argument about that. Equally, we contend that removing this option will lead to an overall reduction in the numbers. The community sentencing structure allows for flexibility. I come back to the noble Lord&#146;s point; perhaps I may quote the speech by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice back to him, as it clearly said that, within the context of the custody threshold, there is a wide borderline area where it is open to the court to choose between sending the offender to prison or dealing with him in some other way. It is not a simple black or white issue, which is why we need to take this action.</p>

Once the hoops have been gone through, the court has effectively foreclosed the discretion that it would otherwise have on non-imprisonment. There is an illogicality in the situation, although I say in fairness to the Minister that it is not Clause 10 that causes the illogicality. The illogicality has been there for some years; it has been there since there was a provision in one statute that stated that you had to determine whether imprisonment was inevitable in all the circumstances and a power from 1967 to suspend a sentence. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, is absolutely right. The situation has already been foreclosed. There is no discretion once that finding is made. Going back on that decision is utterly illogical. Our concern is to see fewer people sent to prison for breach of suspended sentences and I do not mind how logical the ultimate situation will be if it is successful in achieving that end.</p>

The Minister has to suppose that more magistrates are giving people suspended sentences than are following the procedures in the correct way&#151;the procedure of the Sentencing Guidelines Council and the procedure in their court bench book.</p>

The reason why the Government have got themselves into difficulties on this is that they have an ulterior motive for the clause, which is to reduce the scale of the prison population. The correct way to approach this clause is to look at it on its merits. The fact is, as many of your Lordships said, that when magistrates approach sentencing matters, their first port of call will be the Sentencing Guidelines Council. On the question of suspended sentences, as many of your Lordships again said, the guidance is about as crystal clear as it could possibly be: once the custodial threshold is passed, unless there is an option for a suspended sentence, the magistrates must imprison.</p>

<a name="80226-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08022661000145"></a>It is much more likely that the magistrates will be paying attention to the Sentencing Guidelines Council than to a speech by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. In saying that, I in no way wish to disparage his wisdom. Indeed, there are circumstances in which judges in the Crown Court and magistrates, having decided that an offence reaches or passes a custodial threshold, will nevertheless, in very specific circumstances that they will set out in great detail when they sentence, give a community disposition. In my submission, however, those circumstances are rare, particularly as nowadays the Crown Prosecution Service is quick to inform the Attorney-General if it thinks that a judge is undersentencing. The notion that a whole raft of community sentences will replace the removed suspended sentence is a chimera.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08022661000157"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 12 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="08022661000158"></a><b><a name="80226-0009.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08022661000374"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> My concerns are with Clause 12(5), which inserts new subsection (1A)(b) into Section 151 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The clause states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08022661000281"></a>&#147;Where the current offence is not punishable with imprisonment, subsection (2) applies where ... on three or more previous occasions the offender has, on conviction by a court in the United Kingdom of any offence committed by him after attaining the age of 16, had passed on him a sentence consisting only of a fine&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022661000250"></a>In other words, if three less serious matters are dealt with by means of a fine, the court can impose a community sentence but, if there have been more serious offences in the past, it cannot. So if we are dealing with an offence that is non-imprisonable, magistrates can impose a community order only if matters are aggravated by three previous fines, rather than more serious sentences.</p>

<a name="80226-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08022661000159"></a>For example, if an offender has been fined for three previous drunk and disorderly offences, the magistrates  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_608"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can impose a community penalty. However, if an offender has been the subject of a community order for a Section 5 Public Order Act offence, magistrates cannot impose another community order for a repeat similar serious offence. This means, inevitably, that a more serious offence may receive only a less serious disposal. It would also mean that offences that are similar in seriousness might receive different levels of disposal, depending on the sentences previously given. That is not sensible. How does it fit with the fact that previous convictions of all types aggravate seriousness?</p>

<a name="80226-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08022661000160"></a>This is another example of the Government trying to remove the discretion of a judge. There are a whole range of factors that the court would wish to take into account before determining whether or not to make a community order. In our submission, it must be a matter for the court at its judicial discretion to say how serious a particular offence is and to mark that with a community order if appropriate.</p>

He knows that the aim of the clause is to ensure that limited probation resources are directed where they can have most effect. This will help the Probation Service to concentrate on offenders who really need intensive supervision, either because they are dangerous or because they are at a very high risk of reoffending. Those who commit offences where the maximum penalty is a fine are unlikely to fall into this category; for them, a fine is usually the most appropriate punishment. That is why the Government believe that community orders should be available only for imprisonable offences. It seems so far in this debate that that view is shared in the Committee, as there has been no amendment to suggest that we are wrong in that thought.</p>

<a name="80226-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08022661000162"></a>For offences where a fine is the maximum penalty, courts will still be able to impose a fine or discharge, as at present, plus other ancillary disposals, such as compensation, driving disqualification or football banning orders, as appropriate. Committal to prison will still be available for wilful refusal or culpable neglect to pay the fine. The new provision will apply to offenders aged 18 and over only. Examples of offences for which a fine is the maximum statutory penalty are having no vehicle insurance, minor public order offences, careless driving, TV licence evasion, simple drunkenness and firework offences. These are all offences where discharge or a fine is generally the appropriate sentence and where it is not normally necessary to involve the Probation Service by imposing community interventions.</p>

<a name="80226-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08022661000163"></a>The history of all this is interesting. Before April 2005, some community sentences were available for imprisonable sentences only&#151;for example, the community punishment order, which imposed unpaid work, and the community punishment rehabilitation order, which imposed unpaid work and supervision. Since that date, under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the community order with its 12 possible requirements has been available for all offences. For the reasons that I have given, we are now restricting its use to imprisonable offences  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_609"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only. I very much hope that we have the support of the Committee on that. This means that for unpaid work, for example, which is the most frequently used requirement for a community order where there is only one requirement, we are doing no more than returning to the position under the earliest legislation.</p>

<a name="80226-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08022661000164"></a>The clause also updates the provision on the statute book; it is to this provision that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, refers in his argument. It allows a court to impose a community order where the offence is not serious enough to warrant such a sentence but where the offender has previously received three or more fines. This represents an exception to the restriction of the community order to imprisonable offences. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will know, this provision has not been commenced, but is amended so that it is consistent with restricting the community order to imprisonable offences. Even without this provision in force, the law allows a court to regard persistence as an aggravating factor when deciding seriousness, so that repeat offenders will receive higher fines than would otherwise have been imposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08022661000165"></a>The noble Lord asked what happens if the three previous offences are more severe and demanded more than a simple fine. I will reply to that as best I can. This is not new. Section 151 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, although not in force, has been law for some time. The Government do not believe that it lacks logic. Where previous offences were severely dealt with by a community order because they deserved one&#151;they reached that tariff&#151;it would seem overburdensome, even unfair, for them to count again towards another community order. We think that, if persistent offenders keep committing offences for which a fine is the appropriate penalty, the time comes when the court needs to have the power to say, &#147;A fine is obviously not stopping you doing this, so you now move up a bracket and you go up to being deserving of a community order&#148;. It is that eventuality, which has been on the statute book now for some years but has not yet been implemented, that we are replicating in Clause 12 of this Bill.</p>

Like the Prison Service, the Probation Service is under tremendous pressure. If I have understood him correctly, the main motive for this provision is to take some of the pressure off the Probation Service by requiring these three hurdles&#151;the three fines&#151;to be leapt before a community order can be imposed. Essentially, a resources factor is driving the Government&#146;s approach to this clause. I am really asking the Government whether that is the right way to fetter the discretion of the magistrates. They have to deal with individual cases and there will be circumstances in which new subsection (1A)(b) under Clause 12(5) will fetter their discretion in a way that they will, inevitably, consider wholly inappropriate.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08022661000167"></a>We take the view that discretion should be retained to decide on whether a community disposition should be made, irrespective of the number of times that fines had been levied previously. Given that view, would the Government be attracted by an alternative approach, whereby guidance is issued rather than there being a legal requirement under the Bill?</p>

However, just because that person becomes liable for a community sentence does not mean that they necessarily receive one. The Sentencing Guidelines Council guidelines published in December 2004, <I>New Sentences: Criminal Justice Act 2003</I>, which cover the imposition of community orders, say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08022661000282"></a>&#147;Sentencers must consider all of the disposals available (within or below the threshold passed) at the time of sentence, and reject them before reaching a provisional decision to make a community sentence, so that even where the threshold for a community sentence has been passed a financial penalty or discharge may still be an appropriate penalty&#148;.</p>

New Schedule 15A sets out a relatively small list of particularly grave offences that can render an offender liable to a public protection sentence even where his or her immediate offence does not meet the two-year minimum tariff threshold. So, if an offender has a previous conviction for one of these offences&#151;a Schedule 15A offence&#151;and on a future occasion commits a further sexual or violent offence, the courts will have the power to impose a public protection sentence upon him or her even where that tariff for the instant offence is below the two-year threshold.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_611"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 611</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80226-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08022661000176"></a>We are clarifying the schedule in several respects. We wish to put beyond doubt the fact that previous convictions for the inchoate versions of the listed offences will qualify for a public protection sentence even where the trigger offence does not meet the two-year threshold. The amendments in this respect reflect law reform developments by referring to the provisions of Part 2 of the Serious Crime Act 2007, which now govern the position on encouraging or assisting offences. Similarly, new Schedule 15A is amended to include reference to an offender who aided or abetted the commission of an offence that is listed in the schedule.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08022661000177"></a>We think that these are sensible clarifications of the scope of new Schedule 15A and will enhance public protection. I hope that the Committee will agree that an offender may play a substantial role through inchoate offences; that he may be no less dangerous, because, for example, he was interrupted or prevented in the course of the offence; or that he may have been an accessory to the committed previous offence.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08022661000178"></a>It will remain the case that there is judicial discretion in whether a public protection sentence is given. The court will not be obliged to impose a public protection sentence simply because an offender has a previous conviction for an offence listed in new Schedule 15A; but it may do so if in the circumstances it thinks that that is appropriate.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08022661000179"></a>We are also including the offence of murder in new Schedule 15A. If an offender who has been released on licence from prison for murder commits a further violent or sexual offence, he will qualify for a further public protection sentence even if the further offence would be below the two-year threshold. While in practice this may make little difference, given that all murderers will be on life licence, we accept that its inclusion is logical and makes the law more complete.</p>

This provision is not without precedent. A similar form is used in Schedules 3 and 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to set out the offences that make an offender liable to the imposition of a sexual offences prevention order. It also reflects the drafting approach used in Schedule 34 to this Bill for the purposes of construing the meaning of &#147;child sex offences&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

In moving it, I am aware that I will be opposed not only by the Government but also by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. It is so rare that I find myself in discordance with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, that I thought that I should mark the occasion by an introductory observation.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08022661000189"></a>The conditions for imposing an IPP are: first, that the crime must be one of 153 specified sexual or violent offences; secondly, that the offence must be capable of attracting a sentence of 10 or more years of imprisonment; and, thirdly, the offender must pose a significant risk of causing death or serious injury by the commission of further offences. In such cases, the judge must impose an IPP. The offender must serve a minimum tariff before he can be considered for release but can be held in custody as long as he is considered to pose a threat to public safety.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08022661000190"></a>The latest figures indicate that at least half of all sentences given for threats to kill, child sex offences, arson and sexual assault, resulted in a tariff of less than two years. That means that if the Government press ahead with their plans, those individuals will not be eligible for IPPs, given that their sentence length would be below the &#147;to be introduced&#148; threshold. Does the Minister accept that there is a reason that judges sentence people to IPPs and that it is because they are dangerous? Why are the Government so keen to remove this power from the courts? Is it not the case that these proposed changes are dangerous and have more to do with reducing the prison population than protecting the public?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08022661000191"></a>By definition, the offenders who would now no longer be eligible to receive IPPs would be those who had committed serious sexual or violent offences and who posed a significant risk of causing death or serious injury by reoffending, but where the offence for which they were being sentenced would otherwise have carried a fixed-term sentence of less than four years.

The Government have accepted that the effect of Sections 225 to 229 of the 2003 Act has been other than the expected. Mr David Hanson, the Minister in charge of the Bill, described the relevant provisions as well-meaning, but he then went on to say that they no longer serve a proper purpose. I agree, but I think that it is a serious understatement.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08022661000194"></a>In truth, the effect of the relevant provisions has been catastrophic. They are one of the major causes of overcrowding in our prisons today. Anne Owers, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, dealt with indeterminate sentences at some length in her very recent report. She described what had happened as a debacle. Does the noble Lord agree with that description? I suspect he does because there are now over 3,400 men in prisons serving indeterminate sentences, nearly half of them for relatively minor offences for which the tariff would be less than two years. The number is increasing at the rate of 150 a month.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08022661000195"></a>Many of those at the lower end of the scale have already completed their tariff, but they cannot get before the Parole Board, which would be their next step, for two main reasons. First, the Parole Board is grossly overburdened. The board estimates that if things go on as they are, they will need to make room for a staggering 4,000 hearings in 2009-10. The word &#147;staggering&#148; is not mine but is that of Anne Owers. Secondly, those who wish to go before the Parole Board cannot do so because, as the prisons are so overcrowded, they cannot get on to the training courses that they need to complete before they can apply to the Parole Board. As the Lord Chief Justice said in a recent speech, we cannot go on like this.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08022661000196"></a>Happily, the Government have now at last recognised the mistakes that they made in 2003, hence Clauses 13 to 17 of the Bill, which go a certain way in the right direction, but not, in my view, anything like far enough. That is the purpose of my later amendments.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08022661000197"></a>I must turn to the Conservative Opposition. What is their attitude to all this? Do they support the Government in their belated attempt to do something about the crisis in our prisons or do they not? I regret very much to say that the answer must be that they do not. Of course, they are entitled to say, as they do, that overcrowding is all the Government&#146;s fault and that they should have built more prisons. Of course, they can make, and are right to make, a strong political point about prison building, but the crisis in prisons is now too serious and too urgent for political point-scoring of that kind by either side. In a recent speech, the Lord Chief Justice called for a national debate on the whole question of prisons and sentencing. He added this warning:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08022661000286"></a>&#147;Such a debate will be of no avail, indeed it will probably not be a possibility, unless those taking part are prepared to put to one side the opportunities that this subject always provides for scoring political points and to consider, objectively, what is in the best interests of our society&#148;.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08022661000198"></a>Surely it is now up to the main political parties to put aside their fears of being thought soft on crime and to think instead of the injustice being done to those serving indeterminate sentences for minor crimes without any certainty of being able to put their case before the Parole Board and who are now, therefore, without any hope of early release. Above all, we must not make the situation worse by adding to their number, which is what would be the effect of Amendment No. 81. The purpose of that amendment, we are told, is to leave Section 225 as it is, to remove the proposed threshold of two years. If so, the indeterminate sentence will remain available for those who have committed quite minor crimes. If that is the purpose, it will only make overcrowding worse. The Conservative Opposition are moving in the wrong direction and I oppose the amendment.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08022661000199"></a>I add one last point. The effect of the amendment may be something quite other than what the noble Lord assumes. If you leave out new subsection (3B), as the amendment proposes, the indeterminate sentence could be imposed only where the offender has previously committed a very serious offence such as murder or rape, as set out in Schedule 6, which covers only 22 very serious offences compared with the existing 153 offences under the old Schedule 5. So the effect of the amendment would be to reduce the number of those for whom an indeterminate sentence is available. If that is the effect of the amendment, as I believe it to be, though I may well be wrong, I would support it. But I would still prefer to reduce the number by increasing the notional minimum term from two to four years. In the mean time, I wait to hear whether my reading of the effect of the amendment is as I say.</p>

In the context of this amendment, I had hoped to pay some attention to the conduct of the sentence itself. When this was first announced in the 2003 Act, a number of us were very concerned about what it would mean for the Prison Service&#146;s ability to do what it should be doing with and for prisoners on behalf of the public. All our worst fears have come to pass: not only are the prisons choked with people; the Prison Service simply does not have the resources, people, programmes or anything else that is needed to do what needs to be done with and for these people.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08022661000201"></a>I had hoped to link the problem of dealing with indeterminate-sentenced prisoners with the number of those who are sentenced for natural life. There is no doubt but that some people&#146;s dangerousness continues in such a way that the indeterminateness of their sentence means they will never be released. I say that because one group that always concerned me as chief inspector were those who had been sentenced to natural life and for whom there was no hope of release, so they had nothing positive to aim for. Not only was there nothing positive for them; the situation also had an enormous effect on prison staff. One aspect of this sentence which has not been given due credence or attention is the impact on prison staff of having to deal with this group of prisoners who become more suicidal, difficult and frustrated. They

It cannot be solved by tinkering with timing. It must be looked at so that it affects only those whose dangerousness is such that the indeterminateness is linked to public protection. Rather than being viewed almost as an academic exercise, it should be seen as an exercise in sensible sentencing.</p>

The Government very much welcome the opportunity for a serious debate on these matters. My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor has signalled that he is very much prepared for a serious debate. I also think that the recommendations in the report of my noble friend Lord Carter, particularly on a sentencing framework for the future, on which work led by a senior member of the judiciary has now been done, may offer a constructive way of dealing with these matters in a sober and mature way. They will ensure that we are in kilter with the legislation, the action of sentencers and the question of the prison population. I am sure that that is a constructive way in which to go forward.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08022661000203"></a>We have had a good introduction from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and others on the reason why public protection sentences were introduced. They were to protect the public and it is clear that the courts have taken up the use of those sentences in substantial numbers. There have proved to be issues with the focus and operation of sentences. Perhaps we are following the law of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, but it had not been foreseen that many IP prisoners would have such short tariffs, although the legislation as it stands does not prevent that. The figures I have suggest that around 30 per cent now receive a tariff of two years or less. The average for all IPPs is 38 months and the record so far is 28 days. Aside from the question this raises as to whether the sentences are at an appropriate level of risk management for offenders whose trigger offence justifies only a low tariff, clearly, on a practical level short-tariff prisoners are difficult for correctional services to manage and a disproportionate amount of resources are used in trying to do so. As noble Lords have said, they make great demands on the Prison Service, which must prepare them to appear before the Parole Board, and on the Parole Board in terms of its workload, about which we heard something recently.</p>

<a name="80226-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08022661000204"></a>At the end of January there were 3,850 offenders in prison serving an IPP. I understand that 17 IP prisoners have so far been released and it is predicted that the potential IPP population could grow to around 12,500 by 2011. We have already taken measures to assist the situation of those currently in prison on indeterminate sentences, but we believe that that is not sufficient to deal with the particular issue that we face. The statute is being reformed to ensure better use of the sentence and to enable us to manage risk more effectively across the piece.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08022661000205"></a>My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor announced his intention to make changes to this legislation and in particular to impose a seriousness threshold that should be met before an indeterminate sentence can be imposed. My noble friend Lord Carter of Coles recommended this approach in his review. We have already heard the comments of Anne Owers, Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons, in support of that intention.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80226-0011.htm"/>


<a name="80226-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08022661000206"></a>On the substantive point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, we think the threshold that we are suggesting is reasonable. It will target the most dangerous offenders without violating risk management. There is an association between the seriousness of an offence and the risk of future conviction and causing future harm, although that is obviously not the only factor in risk assessment. There is also the principle issue about the degree to which one can lock a person up on the basis of future risk. That, of course, goes to the core of the legislation. The question is whether the balance is right, and in the light of experience we think that we have not got it right. It had not been envisaged that the sentences would be used so widely for less serious offenders.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08022661000207"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, as a safeguard, we have included in the threshold legislation exceptions for those offenders who have shown themselves to be very dangerous by committing a particularly serious offence. When an offender has committed one of the offences set out in new Schedule 15A to the 2003 Act, the threshold need not apply to him if he commits future sexual and violent offences. The court will not be obliged to give him a public protection sentence, but will be able to if it sees fit in all the circumstances.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08022661000208"></a>I come to an associated question of how we are improving interventions for those people covered by the current IPP regime. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that I well understand the pressures on prison staff. That point is very well taken. We have allocated &#163;3 million to provide for additional assessments and interventions this financial year. We need to provide the right courses, programmes and training, and ultimate responsibility in that context still rests with the Parole Board and satisfying it that the level of risk is reduced. That still rests with the offender, but clearly there is more that we need to do to ensure that the appropriate programmes are in place.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08022661000209"></a>I also take the point raised by the noble Lord in relation to those prisoners who are likely to remain in prison for a very long time. We have debated on a number of occasions the many challenges facing the Prison Service at the moment, particularly in view of the population pressures. But I would say to the noble Lord that in the past few years we have also seen appreciable improvements in many of our prisons in the development of appropriate programmes and in dealing with some of the other issues that impact on these prisoners. The noble Lord mentioned mental health problems, in particular, which I endorse. The working group review established under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Bradley is considering some of those matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08022661000210"></a>Clearly a question of judgment is involved. We think the principle of these sentences is right, but we did not get the balance right. We have seen the impact in terms of the number of very short sentences that have become embraced within the system. We will discuss later whether the two-year threshold is appropriate, but overall we think that we have the balance right. This will be a better foundation for this sentence structure in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08022661000215"></a>The real problem with IPPs and prison place availability is that if you are in prison for an IPP and have served your minimum term, you cannot get out without being rehabilitated. Rehabilitation requires considerable educational input by experts on the prison premises, and equally requires the prisoner, as a result of going through this process, to have manifestly changed his outlook on life. It is currently quite impossible to initiate, let alone complete, these processes because of the overcrowding. IPPs are not merely not working at the level which the Government now seek to exclude, they are not working full stop. This is why there is so much discontent in our prisons among those who have been sentenced to an IPP: they are simply not being given an opportunity to get out of jail. Until that issue is resolved&#151;and it cannot be resolved in the present state of overcrowding&#151;we will not see much constructive progress in this area, whatever the outcome of this clause in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08022661000216"></a>My difficulty with the clause is that the length of the sentence and the assessment of dangerousness are wholly unconnected. The fact that somebody has been given a sentence with a minimum tariff of two years&#151;which means that the IPP will no longer be applied to him if the Bill gets through&#151;is completely irrelevant to the judge&#146;s view of his likelihood of committing a dangerous offence in the future. That is why the Government are being illogical. The question of the risk and the question of the level of sentence

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08022661000217"></a>Of course, I agree with all Members of the Committee who say that IPPs are not only contributing seriously to prison overcrowding but also affecting the psychological state of many prisoners. That is true. However, with great respect to the Minister, the way that he is going about solving this problem is wholly illogical. We owe a duty to the public to protect them from dangerous people. If judges make an assessment that these people are dangerous, even though they have given a sentence which has a minimum tariff of two years, we must still accept the judgment of the court.

To get out of the indeterminate sentence there is a doorway painted on a wall: &#147;Come this way. You will do your course, which will make you a better citizen and help you understand how to lead your life in the future and apply to get out of the indeterminate sentence&#148;. In fact, that is a hollow farce because you cannot enter through that door. You are in the system. You should not be an indeterminate sentence man or woman anyway, and you have no hope of getting out. The right to liberty is guaranteed by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. No doubt there is an exception in the case of imprisonment, but this is the most bizarre type of imprisonment and, as one listens to the debate as a newcomer, it has some absolutely extraordinary dimensions. It is very unjust.</p>

There seem actually to be two human rights issues here. First, the point about locking somebody up on the basis of future risk itself raises a human rights question. Secondly, the basis on which an IPP order is made by a court is that the individual has a right to be rehabilitated, or a least has the right to an opportunity to be rehabilitated. If that right is in practice a fiction, is that a denial of someone&#146;s human rights under the convention? It must be an arguable case, must it not?</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08022672000003"></a>The noble and right reverend Lord said: My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to raise an issue that is of such life and death significance to the suffering people of West Papua.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08022672000004"></a>When I go round to our local shops, I almost invariably carry over my shoulder a handmade bag. On this bag is a star against a red background with some blue and white stripes. If I shopped in West Papua with that bag, I would immediately be labelled a separatist and treated with brutality, as a woman was recently who was found making such a bag. Similarly, on 1 December last year, seven West Papuans were arrested for raising this morning star flag in the Catholic Church compound at Kwamki Baru village. Again, when the editor of a West Papuan newspaper was asked what would happen to him if he called for independence, he said quite simply, &#147;Go to jail. Go to jail&#148;. Perhaps this total lack of freedom&#151;the freedom of the press and the freedom to form political parties&#151;does indeed fall into the category of what the Minister said on 13 November last year were abuses,</p>
<ul><a name="08022672000033"></a>&#147;of a relatively small kind&#148;,&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/11/07; col. 346.]</ul>
<p><a name="08022672000022"></a>even though we regard such freedoms as fundamental to the life of this country.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08022672000005"></a>I wonder about torture. Two hundred and forty two cases of torture have been recorded in the past nine years in West Papua. All are well documented and set out in the recent report of Franciscans International. As that report put it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="08022672000029"></a>&#147;Torture is regarded by Indonesian security services as one of the most effective methods to obtain forced confessions and instil a climate of fear and is conducted repeatedly and systematically. Torture in Papua is also used strategically as a means to control the whole community&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022672000023"></a>If this is still regarded as abuse &#147;of a relatively small kind&#148;, will the Minister say how many more cases of torture have to be recorded before it is admitted that there are abuses of a very grave kind indeed&#151;abuses that the Government need to address with great seriousness and urgency?</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08022672000006"></a>This systematic brutality is of course all in support of the 1969 &#147;act of no choice&#148;. On 14 January this year, the Minister in the other place wrote to a Member describing the act in these words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="08022672000030"></a>&#147;A group of 1,000 Papuan representatives, who were given the responsibility to make the choice on behalf of the Papuan people, voted to remain part of Indonesia&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022672000024"></a>The bland disingenuousness of that statement is almost unbelievable. Let us remind ourselves of the facts. Suharto sent this clear order to his military forces in West Papua: &#147;See that the&#148; act &#147;on West Irian&#146;s&#148;&#151;that is Papua&#146;s&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08022672000034"></a>&#147;future status will yield a clear pronouncement in favour of Indonesia&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022672000025"></a>The forces were duly obedient. As Brigadier-General Ali Murtopo put it to those selected to take part in the so-called &#147;act of free choice&#148; on August 1969:</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_621"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 621</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="08022672000031"></a>&#147;This is what will happen to anyone who votes against Indonesia. Their accursed tongues will be torn out. Their full mouths will be wrenched open. Upon them will fall the vengeance of the Indonesia people. I myself will shoot them on the spot&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80226-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08022672000007"></a>So it was that the then Minister in this House, the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, referring to this on 13 December 2004, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08022672000035"></a>&#147;1,000 handpicked representatives ... were largely coerced into declaring for inclusion in Indonesia&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/12/04; col. 1084.]</ul>
<p><a name="08022672000026"></a>Later, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, described the 1969 process as &#147;extremely flawed&#148;. Will the Minister therefore say, in the light of the recent letter from the Minister in the other place, whether the Government are now back-tracking from the truth which they previously admitted? The acknowledgement of the truth of the 1969 travesty by the British Government has been one of the few crumbs of comfort offered to the suffering West Papuan people in recent years. Is even that crumb of truth now to be snatched away?</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08022672000008"></a>If all this is not serious enough, I have yet to come to the most devastating fact of all. In 1971, there were 887,000 Papuan people and 36,000 Asian Indonesians in West Papua, so even after eight years of Indonesian control, Papuans comprised 96 per cent of the population. On the basis of the latest figures, it is estimated that in 2005 Papuans comprised 59 per cent of the population and others 41 per cent. On present trends, by 2030 Papuans will comprise only 15.6 per cent and non-Papuans 84.8 per cent. These figures speak for themselves. Papuans are becoming a minority in their own country. Juan Mendes, UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, described West Papua as being among those countries whose populations were &#147;at risk of extinction&#148;.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08022672000009"></a>The most decisive statement to date on the subject of genocide in West Papua has come from the Allard K Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School, which published a paper in 2005 entitled <I>Indonesian Human Rights Abuses in West Papua: Application of the Law of Genocide to the History of Indonesian Control</I>. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="08022672000032"></a>&#147;Although no single act or set of acts can be said to have constituted genocide, per se, and although the required intent cannot be as readily inferred as it was in the cases of the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, there can be little doubt that the Indonesian government has engaged in a systematic pattern of acts that has resulted in harm to&#151;and indeed the destruction of&#151;a substantial part of the indigenous population of West Papua. The inevitability of this result was readily obvious, and the government has taken no active measures to contravene it. According to current understanding of the Genocide Convention, including its interpretation in the jurisprudence of the ad hoc international criminal tribunals, such a pattern of actions and inactions&#151;of acts and omissions&#151;supports the conclusion that the Indonesian government has acted with the necessary intent to find that it has perpetrated genocide against the people of West Papua&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80226-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08022672000010"></a>West Papua is a small country a long way away. Indonesia is a big player with which we have major trade deals. West Papua is rich in natural resources, and major international companies such as BP, Rio Tinto and BAE Systems, among others, are active in utilising them.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08022672000011"></a>There are those who think that if only they stall long enough the problem will go away, solved by  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_622"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 622</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>demography if nothing else. But I should like to assure the Government and reassure the West Papuan people that this issue will not be dropped and already momentum is gathering round the world. Recently two US congressmen, Donald Payne and Eni Faleomavaega, have taken up the issue with the UN Secretary-General. They were particularly concerned with the way that human rights defenders were harassed after the visit of Mrs Jilani, the UN special envoy, last year.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08022672000012"></a>Mrs Jilani concluded that a climate of fear prevails in West Papua, which has been borne out by the way in which those who sought to contact her have been singled out for special intimidation. The human rights abuses in West Papua are very grave and I ask the Government to pursue that issue with very great seriousness, conviction and urgency. In particular, human rights defenders need special protection, so I would ask the Minister to work for an international presence in West Papua to ensure that those who are raising human rights issues can do so without the present fear of intimidation, torture and death.</p>

This is not the first occasion on which we have discussed the appalling events in West Papua. Sadly, our debates have failed to lead to any improvement for the people of West Papua, or, apparently, to impress on our Government the magnitude of the suffering. The last occasion on which we spared a thought for this situation was on 13 November 2007, when the noble and right reverend Lord asked a Starred Question. My noble friend Lord Malloch-Brown replied with an undisguised candour that the Government do not propose to raise the matter in the Security Council and do not support Papuan independence.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08022672000014"></a>We have not been privy to the Government&#146;s reasoning which led to that conclusion, but if there are two propositions which defy reputation they are, first, that if they were permitted to express a view, the overwhelming majority of the population would choose independence. As the noble and right reverend Lord has said, the so-called act of free choice was a blatantly transparent charade. We know that the American ambassador reported at that time that 85 to 90 per cent of the population were in sympathy with the Free Papua Movement. Secondly, West Papua passes all the tests in international law for a right to the free choice of its own destiny. I shall not weary your Lordships by repeating what I said on that issue on 8 January 2007.</p>

<a name="80226-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08022672000015"></a>However, the subject of today&#146;s debate is not about the right of self-determination, but about the consequences of leaving West Papuans to the mercy of a brutal, alien regime. During our exchanges on 13 November, my noble friend stated as the Government&#146;s view that, while they are concerned by continuing human rights abuses in Papua, they believe that they are,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08022672000016"></a>It is hardly the impression that emerges from the 2007 annual report of Amnesty International, which records that the torture and ill treatment of detainees is widespread, and we recall of course that many detainees are imprisoned for peaceful protests. The report continues that prison conditions fall short of international standards. It speaks of extra-judicial executions and records that in 2007, there were at least six occasions when security forces opened fire on civilians. It tells us that the perpetrators appear to enjoy immunity.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08022672000017"></a>Nor did my noble friend&#146;s characterisation of the human rights infringements accord with the recent Human Rights Watch country summary on Indonesia, which said that, in West Papua, peaceful political activists continue to be classified as &#147;separatists&#148;, which is a criminal offence. The report speaks of village &#147;sweeping operations&#148; carried out with great brutality by the army, the police and paramilitary units. It mentioned too that the regional military commander appointed in 2007, Colonel Siagian, was indicted by the United Nations for crimes against humanity in East Timor.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08022672000018"></a>The Government&#146;s view was not supported by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in Geneva last August, which commented that at last Indonesia had complied with its reporting obligations under the convention. The report&#151;six years overdue&#151;refrained from commenting that this road-to-Damascus conversion may be connected with Indonesia&#146;s ambition to be re-elected to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. The report adds that Indonesia has still not implemented the convention in its domestic legislation.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08022672000019"></a>Nor is the Government&#146;s assessment in accordance with the report by Franciscans International, which notes that,</p>
<ul><a name="08022672000037"></a>&#147;in the Province of West Papua, the steadfast pattern of human rights violations, including torture, repression of the freedom of expression, unfair trials, arbitrary detention and the denial of social, economic and cultural rights, have created a culture of fear and have resulted in a stagnated development, which has made Papua the least developed province of Indonesia&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022672000028"></a>I leave it to other noble Lord to comments on the rape of Papua&#146;s mineral wealth, which is now being shared between the Indonesian Government and foreign investors, but not by the Papuan people.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08022672000020"></a>In at least one respect, I sympathise with the Government&#146;s problem. It is not easy in the present state of international law, and in the absence of charter reform, to suggest a simple remedy. Of course, no one would recommend an invasion as anything but a final resort when diplomatic approaches, appeals from human rights organisations and sanctions have failed to provide a solution. But a reference to the Security Council by a Government who carry the international respect of the United Kingdom could be a beginning and could reassure the West Papuan people that someone cares.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08022672000021"></a>I suspect that history will not understand how human suffering on such a scale continued year after year while the world looked on complacently and

<a name="08022674000002"></a><b><a name="80226-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022674000273"></a>Baroness Cox:</b> My Lords, I congratulate my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries on giving us this opportunity to speak on the important subject of human rights in West Papua. Since Indonesia took over the administration of the territory nearly 45 years ago, the plight of the indigenous Melanesian population has deteriorated and been largely ignored by the international community. I have been involved in some of the other tragic situations in Indonesia in recent years, especially the bitter conflict initiated in 1999 by Lasker Jihad in Maluku and Sulawesi. I was present during some of the most severe violence there and witnessed the suffering of both the Christian and the traditional Muslim communities. I was in Ambon when 4,000 to 5,000 Lasker Jihad warriors were stationed there and I visited Poso in Sulawesi shortly after Lasker Jihad carried out brutal attacks on the Christian and Hindu communities.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08022674000003"></a>I was also privileged to respond to a request by the Christian and traditional Muslim leaders to help to promote reconciliation between the communities and reconstruction of the devastated infrastructure by helping to establish the International Islamic Christian Organisation for Reconciliation and Reconstruction, a title that mercifully abbreviates to IICORR. Noble Lords will see the relevance of this in a moment. The organisation was launched in Jakarta with former President Abdurrahman Wahid as its president, and we were delighted when Her Majesty&#146;s Government used IICORR to bring an interfaith delegation to the United Kingdom to develop principles and policies for reconciliation and reconstruction away from the conflict zone. We were also very pleased when, on its return to Ambon, a resurgence of conflict was quickly contained as a result of the good faith that had been established between the leaders of the two communities while here in Britain.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08022674000004"></a>I refer to these events for two reasons. First, they might provide a precedent for helping to resolve the tensions and conflicts in West Papua and, secondly, they are one example of Indonesia&#146;s progress in trying to improve its record on human rights and the development of democracy and civil society. The situation is therefore all the more a tragic blot on Indonesia&#146;s record of endeavours to achieve improvements. I hope that this debate, which will highlight the problems, may prompt the Indonesian authorities to address them as a matter of great urgency.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08022674000005"></a>Religious faith is at the very centre of West Papuan life and identity. Christianity arrived in West Papua in 1855. I understand that now approximately 95 per cent of the indigenous population is Christian. The remaining 5 per cent includes a small Papuan Muslim population, whose conversion to Islam predates the current period of Indonesian rule. As my noble and right reverend friend has said, the demographic change is extremely serious. In 1970, indigenous Papuans made up 96 per cent of the population but,  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_625"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 625</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as the result of state-sponsored and spontaneous Indonesian immigration into West Papua since 1963, by 2005 indigenous Papuans made up only 59 per cent of the population, with 41 per cent non-Papuan, mostly Javanese Muslims. According to recent research by Dr Jim Elmslie of the West Papua Project at the University of Sydney&#146;s Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, if present demographic trends continue, West Papua will be a majority Indonesian, predominantly Javanese Muslim population by 2011, while by 2030 the indigenous Melanesian, predominantly Christian Papuans will be a dwindling 15 per cent minority.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08022674000006"></a>With 1,500,000 West Papuan Christians in an Indonesian state of 230 million mostly Muslim Indonesians, it would be an easy mistake to portray this conflict in terms of Christian versus Muslim, but that would be a misleading and dangerous oversimplification. The conflict is primarily political&#151;a struggle for West Papuan independence&#151;with the West Papuans seeking their internationally recognised right to self-determination in a UN-administered, one-person-one-vote referendum. The so-called &#147;Act of Free Choice&#148;, to which reference has already been made, is now generally recognised as state-managed by Suharto&#146;s Indonesia. It was an affront to democratic values. Moreover, the events of 1969 must not be seen by the international community as an acceptable, just and final situation.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08022674000007"></a>There is, however, a significant religious dimension to the conflict. Christianity is officially recognised under the Indonesian constitution, and the provisions in the Pancasila have been generally honoured throughout most of Indonesian society. Christians have by and large been allowed to settle and flourish, until the intrusion of militant forces in recent years and the emergence of significant elements within Indonesian society that have sought to use Islam as a vehicle for Indonesian nationalism and the forcible extension of authoritarian control to outlying regions such as West Papua. This facet of the West Papua conflict was highlighted by an Australian Special Broadcasting Service television report in 2005, which featured an interview with a Papuan who claimed to have infiltrated a Lasker Jihad training camp in the town of Sorong. These are his words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="08022674000133"></a>&#147;The sort of activities Lasker Jihad were involved in, in Sorong, were firstly, intimidating and killing Papuans who were involved in the Papua Independence Movement, and secondly, spreading rumours in various places, to create fear&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022674000129"></a>As recently as 23 February&#151;only a few days ago&#151;the West Papuan Baptist leader, Reverend Socratez Sofyan Yoman, stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="08022674000134"></a>&#147;Jihadists are now operating in every aspect of [West Papuan] society, including in the military and police, business, and throughout the government&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80226-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08022674000008"></a>West Papuans are primarily persecuted by Indonesian security forces simply for being Papuan, but within that persecution are significant anti-Christian elements. Papuans report regularly being abused by Indonesian soldiers and police with terms such as &#147;kaffir&#148; and &#147;pig eater&#148;. West Papuan Christian leaders who bravely speak out about human rights abuses regularly report being subjected to intimidation and threats from Indonesian intelligence agents, police and soldiers. For example, Reverend Benny Giay, leader of the  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_626"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 626</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Tabernacle Church, Kingmi, has received threats and is regularly accused of being a separatist. Also, a Roman Catholic priest, Father John Jonga, from Waris, has been forced into hiding because of death threats from a local commander, who accused him of,</p>
<ul><a name="08022674000196"></a>&#147;spreading false allegations about conditions in Waris to local and international NGOs and of being a provocateur and betraying the Indonesian state&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80226-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08022674000009"></a>Seven religious leaders made a statement on 7 February this year calling for international dialogue for West Papua. They included leaders of the Roman Catholic, Baptist and Pentecostal churches, as well as leaders of the Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist communities. Entitled <I>West Papuan Churches &amp; Other Religions Appeal for an International Dialogue</I>, their statement included an appeal to the international community to have,</p>
<ul><a name="08022674000197"></a>&#147;an honest and peaceful dialogue similar to the Aceh peace process&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022674000130"></a>They recommended that,</p>
<ul><a name="08022674000198"></a>&#147;a solution to the difference of ideology in West Papua must be dealt with immediately by a dialogue between the central [Indonesian] government and the native West Papuans ... facilitated by a neutral third party approved by both parties&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80226-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08022674000010"></a>While they recognise that there are many sensitive issues, they believe that these could be solved through dialogue and reconciliation.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08022674000011"></a>The church and other religious leaders also catalogued numerous concerns, including the excessive number of military personnel in West Papua; the military personnel&#146;s failure to understand or try to learn the local culture; their suspicion of the people, treating them as enemies, creating widespread tensions; the authorities&#146; unwillingness to implement the special autonomy law resulting in an inequitable distribution of educational, health and economic services throughout all Papuan regions; widespread unemployment, leading to tensions and divisions between Papuan tribes; massive exploitation of the region&#146;s natural resources; and numerous examples of killings and destruction of religious buildings. The conclusion of their report, signed in Jayapura, West Papua, on 11 February 2008, is that the special autonomy law No. 21/2001 is a total failure, which has brought disasters to humanity and destroyed the future of native West Papuans. The fact that this appeal was signed by leaders of the different faith communities is evidence of the deep concerns of people of different faiths that their future as West Papuans is under threat.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08022674000012"></a>In an earlier debate in the House on West Papua, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08022674000135"></a>&#147;Papua is in many ways the last blot on Indonesia&#146;s global reputation&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/1/07; col. 104.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022674000131"></a>I therefore ask the Minister whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government will take a more active and urgent interest in the problems associated with the violations of human rights in West Papua and urge the Indonesian Government to undertake urgently needed measures to lead ultimately to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in accordance with the democratic will of the West Papuan people. In particular, would the Government consider facilitating Indonesian-West Papuan dialogue without preconditions under UN or EU auspices? Alternatively, I am sure  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_627"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that IICORR would be very willing to assist in ways similar to those used in the successful initiative in Maluku.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08022674000013"></a>Unless an effective intervention is undertaken urgently, the people of West Papua may be condemned to such continuing oppression and violations of fundamental human rights that their cultural identity and physical survival will be threatened. That is why I passionately hope that they will hear some reassuring message from Her Majesty&#146;s Government tonight.</p>

<a name="08022674000014"></a><b><a name="80226-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022674000274"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, the last time we debated West Papua on an Unstarred Question, that, too, was initiated by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries. He was looking at the issue then primarily from the standpoint of self-determination, which has been referred to by both the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, and the noble Baroness. Now the noble and right reverend Lord is asking us to focus on human rights more generally, although he set that in the context of the right to self-determination.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08022674000015"></a>I begin by reminding your Lordships of the observation by the special rapporteur on self-determination, Hector Gros Espiell, at the Human Rights Commission in 1975, repeated in the report that he made to the General Assembly of 1980. He said that the right of self-determination is of fundamental importance as the prerequisite for the enjoyment of all other human rights. It may be too late to rectify the unlawful transfer of sovereignty from the Netherlands to Indonesia in 1969, but the international community could make some amends for being accomplices in that fraudulent act if we made far greater efforts to persuade Jakarta to follow the pattern wisely adopted in the case of Aceh, to which the attention of your Lordships has been drawn by the noble Baroness, of negotiating a genuine local autonomy.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08022674000016"></a>As the noble Baroness said, West Papua and Aceh were both covered by local autonomy laws, but while Aceh proceeded to free elections&#151;in which members of the Free Aceh movement achieved high office in the case of Governor Irwandi Yusuf and Deputy Governor Muhammad Nazar&#151;in West Papua the people continue to be in the iron grip of the military and Brimob, the paramilitary police. Surely there is a lesson to be drawn from the comparative experiences of Aceh and West Papua. Several years of painstaking negotiation over Aceh, in which I was involved for some time as an adviser to the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue in Geneva, which was the facilitator at that time, led to a successful outcome, and the same could be true of West Papua.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08022674000017"></a>As has been said, there have been several authoritative reports on West Papua over the past year, notably that of the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders following her visit in June. She was deeply concerned by the evidence that she received of the harassment and intimidation of defenders and the restriction of their access to victims and sites of human rights violations throughout Indonesia, but she found that the trend was more pronounced in West Papua, where she received credible evidence of arbitrary detention,  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_628"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 628</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>torture, harassment through surveillance and interference with freedom of movement and with monitors&#146; attempts to investigate human rights abuses. As has been said, these were not the minor infringements of human rights that they had been portrayed as by the Government on a previous occasion.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08022674000018"></a>There were cases where the defenders themselves were threatened with prosecution. Despite assurances given by the authorities that there was no institutional policy of targeting defenders, the concerns of the special rapporteur persisted and she made recommendations for improvements to the mechanisms of oversight and accountability of the police, the military and the intelligence agencies. Can we in the European Union ask the Government of Indonesia what steps they are taking to implement the special rapporteur&#146;s proposals, and can we ensure that this matter is on the agenda for the Human Rights Council at its forthcoming meeting in Geneva? I hope that the Minister will be able to answer that.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08022674000019"></a>The US State Department records a number of cases where the Brimob military has killed civilians at demonstrations. In one case a man was actually beaten to death. The State Department says that, although there are always promises of investigations of these abuses, no member of the security forces has ever been charged. There has been a climate of impunity more generally in Indonesia going back very many years, as we were reminded last month by the death of former President Suharto, who was largely responsible for the institutionalised violence against popular opposition. That included the demand for cultural autonomy in West Papua in the mid-1980s. Today the security forces in West Papua behave as if Suharto were alive and well; they get away with it because large areas of the province are closed to outside scrutiny. I agree with the proposal that has been made that there should be an international presence there to monitor what goes on.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08022674000020"></a>One of the factors that have led to gross human rights abuses in the past has been the operations of the international resource companies, particularly Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold mining company at Timika, which brought in military units that have clashed periodically with local people, leading to a number of deaths and serious injuries. Now, as we have heard, BP is investing $5.5 billion in its LNG plant at Tangguh. That has already led to an influx of 10,000 non-Papuans and to the displacement of local inhabitants. BP says that it is not going to repeat the mistakes made by Freeport, but Carmel Budiardjo of TAPOL, in an article in the February issue of <I>Liberation</I>, says that there were no consultations whatever with local people who lost their occupations and territory, and no compensation was offered to them for their displacement.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08022674000021"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, mentioned that there are a good many political prisoners in the territory. They have been convicted on charges of subversion for participating in peaceful demonstrations or raising flags asserting Papuan identity. In a directive that was issued by the chief of police in December 2005, it was ordered that anyone engaged in commemorative activities on certain dates,  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_629"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 629</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but particularly 1 December, was to be charged with subversion. This was revealed by TAPOL, the Indonesian human rights campaign, of which I have had the honour of being president for many years. I declare my interest.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08022674000022"></a>Human Rights Watch documents a number of these cases, although because of the lack of transparency in the courts and the widespread fear among witnesses and relatives of being charged themselves there may be many others that are not in the public domain. For example, Linus Hiluka was given a 20-year sentence and, in the most notorious case of all, Filep Karma and Yusak Pakage got 15 and 10 years respectively for their activities in peaceful demonstrations.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08022674000023"></a>Human Rights Watch makes a number of recommendations for dealing with this situation. It asks that international donors and Governments raise concerns about regressive policies and curtailing free expression in meetings with President Yudhoyono and government officials; that we regularly monitor trials and meet defendants; that we support comprehensive training in international human rights standards and applicable international law for all members of the judiciary; and that we support comprehensive training in international human rights standards and, again, applicable international law for all members of the police force. I hope that our close friendship with Indonesia will enable us to raise all these matters. Knowing President Yudhoyono, as I do, I am sure that he will listen to us.</p>

While these abuses have been ongoing, a year has passed since West Papua was last debated in this House. It is important that we do not lose sight of the atrocities committed there, despite its geographical distance from Westminster.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08022674000025"></a>Human rights violations in West Papua are frequent. The Government of Indonesia repress the freedom of expression, enforce arbitrary detention and deny the social, economic and cultural rights of the Papuan people. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, set out very eloquently some of the other abuses, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.</p>

<a name="80226-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08022674000026"></a>Torture is a central pillar of West Papuan rule. It is deemed by the Indonesian security services to be one of the most effective methods of keeping order. According to the few charities that do have access to the country, the police paramilitary unit, the Brigade Mobile, is responsible for raping, killing and beating unarmed civilians in Papua. Despite this, with one exception, no one from the unit has been convicted of any crime. This is a chilling place, where there is no jury, no judge and no verdict that is not Indonesian Government-controlled. Merely to fly a West Papuan flag or sell a West Papuan souvenir can merit a life sentence. The murder of 2,000 people in East Timor is the dark precedent that looms behind this picture. Let us not forget that the Indonesian Government stand

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08022674000027"></a>We on these Benches seek to avoid unnecessary bloodshed at all costs. I therefore believe that Her Majesty&#146;s Government should work with the Indonesian Government to establish an inclusive and frank discussion forum to try to achieve a basic standard of human rights. What discussions have Her Majesty&#146;s Government had with Jakarta about Papua? Has the Foreign Secretary met his Indonesian counterpart since his appointment?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08022674000028"></a>In March 2006, the BBC website reported widespread protests against the Indonesian Administration. The UN special representative of the Secretary General on human rights defenders, Ms Jilani&#151;mentioned by the noble and right reverend Lord&#151;observed after her visit that nearly every West Papuan she talked to expressed high levels of dissatisfaction with the Indonesian Government. The Papuan People&#146;s Council does represent an attitude of the West Papuan people. Does the Minister agree that any solution must include this political voice alongside the central Government of Indonesia? Not only will this give the West Papuans some sense of involvement in their Government, it will also give the independence groups a peaceful means of making themselves heard and, one hopes, go some way to ending the current culture of violence. Does the Minister agree that the Papuan People&#146;s Council must be involved in any negotiation with the Indonesian Government if an adequate solution is to be reached?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80226-0013.htm"/>


<a name="80226-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08022674000029"></a>Have Ministers had any discussions with the international community on how it might apply pressure on the Government of Indonesia to harmonise their laws in line with the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment? Are there any plans to enter into talks with other members of the international community so that a unified and properly considered diplomatic plan can be negotiated with regard to West Papua?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08022674000030"></a>I very much look forward to reading the published findings of the UN special rapporteur on torture, Dr Manfred Nowak, on the state of West Papua. I hope that this House will have an opportunity to debate the report and recommendations that he gives to the UN Human Rights Council. I am pleased to see that the first informal signals show that while Nowak was concerned about abuses in a number of areas, there were some improvements. He noted an improved openness to prisons in West Papua, including for those charged with political offences, who are normally the worst treated. While the Indonesian President and his Government&#146;s attitude towards human rights may still be very far from our own, requests for improved conditions for the West Papuan people seem not to have fallen on entirely deaf ears.</p>

As one half of an island that guards its border from the glare of international journalists, with many of its inhabitants tribes people living in the thick of the rainforest, it is difficult to establish quite what goes on. Therefore, I should be interested to know whether any foreign diplomats are

Yet if I can recognise and feel a common shame and concern at what has happened in West Papua, I do not recognise what the noble and right reverend Lord or other speakers have described tonight as Indonesia. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who knows President Yudhoyono, will also know that there has somehow been an enormously unfair characterisation of that country in this debate. </p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08022674000034"></a>Indonesia is a country that has changed enormously over the past decade, including making significant improvements in the field of human rights. It is a country that now has an active parliament, an effective and outspoken civil society and a lively free press. Although your Lordships would not know it from tonight&#146;s discussion, it has one of the most effective human rights commissions in the region, and played a key role in pushing for a human rights element in the Association of South-East Asian Nations charter.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08022674000035"></a>The military, which dominated the country under Suharto, has evolved away from its traditional role. The formal participation of the military and the police in parliament ended in 2004. The peace agreement signed in Aceh in 2005 has been acknowledged in our debate, which, critically, continues to hold and is a major achievement. Certainly, we judge that the Indonesian Government are committed to further improvements in human rights. Like other speakers, I welcome the visits to Papua by Hina Jilani, the UN special representative on human rights defenders, in June of last year and Professor Manfred Nowak, the UN special rapporteur on torture, last November. Both, I might say, went at the invitation of the Indonesian Government. That openness to international scrutiny reflects the progress that Government have made in addressing human rights concerns.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08022674000036"></a>However, I certainly acknowledge the points made by the noble and right reverend Lord and by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and others, since both reports obviously acknowledge real concerns&#151;notably the one on detainees and their conditions. Similarly, in her visit and report, Hina Jilani highlighted the continued challenges for human rights defenders. She  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_632"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 632</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>detailed her concerns at their situation and noted their lack of access to justice and the restrictions on human rights monitors entering Papua. Yet she balanced that against the positive steps taken by the Government, since 1998 to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. As her report also covered Aceh, it noted the improved situation of human rights defenders there.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08022674000037"></a>I could go on with the institutional improvements that Government have made: accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as that on economic, social and cultural rights in 2006. Equally, however, I agree with those who have spoken in this important debate that many challenges remain. We share their concerns about the human rights situation in Papua, including allegations of human rights violations by the Indonesian armed forces, restricted access to Papua for journalists and NGOs and, indeed, a number of cases of prisoners being convicted of treason for displaying the Papuan flag.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08022674000038"></a>Again, however, let us put that concern in context. The new special autonomy legislation for Papua makes provision for that flag to be flown. It has not been translated into local legislation, however, so at this point that change is half-pregnant or in abeyance, or whatever the appropriate metaphor would be. I would urge your Lordships to bear in mind that flags are provocative things even in democracies that put an absolute premium on freedom of speech. The confederate flag in the United States continues to cause eruptions in every presidential campaign that I can recall. So please let us show some understanding for a country, Indonesia, which is in a transition of its own as it moves towards being a full democracy.</p>

But this is a process where there has to be continued political pressure as there was in Aceh to make sure that the spirit and letter of the special autonomy allowed in that legislation is met. Flags are, if you like, a good indicator of whether or not there is progress. So like the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, I will be watching for and will applaud the day that this flag can be flown.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08022674000041"></a>I have followed Papua from outside and followed, as an international development official, the dramas around the exploitation of its gold resources that make it the richest part of Indonesia, and watched before that the massive migrations into Papua from other parts of Indonesia. This region has faced a turbulent development and has been left behind in terms of its political development and, indeed, the well-being of its citizens. These are issues that the central government in far-off Jakarta, which I suspect to some in Papua seems nearly as far away as Westminster, need to address and overcome. What I want to challenge is not the claim that there are major human rights abuses, and if my remarks in November were taken in any way as seeking to diminish or  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_633"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 633</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>demean the suffering of the people of Papua, I apologise. My disagreement with other speakers is not about the realities of the human rights situation, it is just on whether we can put confidence in Indonesia and work with it to see it improve the conditions in Papua and to respect its special autonomy legislation.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08022674000042"></a>In terms of our tracking of this, the noble Lord, Lord Astor, asked about the international presence there. I do not know whether there are permanent embassy staff there. I shall certainly seek to give him an answer. Our own embassy in Jakarta follows the situation closely. An official from our embassy visited Papua last week and held discussions with local officials, NGOs and representatives of religious organisations on many issues, including, very centrally, human rights. We have sought to work through the United Nations envoys and local NGOs, and through our strong and good relationship with the Government of Indonesia, to press them on the agenda that all of us in the House tonight share.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08022674000043"></a>When Hina Jilani was there last June, she raised with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and chief of police threats against human rights defenders. Our embassy in Jakarta has raised the same issues with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has confirmed that it has taken this up directly with the security forces and local authorities. Supporting the work of human rights defenders is a priority for the Foreign Office. That is reflected in our annual human rights report, which in 2006 was dedicated to human rights defenders. There is evidence that the Indonesian Government are focusing on not just words, new institutions and signing international covenants, but really on bringing justice home to Papua itself.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08022674000044"></a>On 25 January this year, the Indonesian Supreme Court reinstated the conviction against the former Garuda pilot Pollycarpus for conspiracy to murder the human rights activist Munir Said Thalib in 2004. Pollycarpus was sentenced to 20 years&#146; imprisonment. On 11 February&#151;just a couple of weeks ago&#151;the former President of Garuda, Indra Setiawan, was sentenced to 12 months&#146; imprisonment for his part in the murder of Munir. So we are seeing real progress.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08022674000045"></a>I was asked whether our Foreign Secretary has met his counterpart, Hasan Wirajuda. He has spoken to him twice on the telephone, although I am told it was not about Papua. I have also met with Hasan Wirajuda for the same reason that the Foreign Secretary has spoken to him. The modern Indonesia is one of our great allies in our efforts in Burma. It is a fellow member of the Security Council at the moment, not a small issue in terms of some of the tactical suggestions tonight. It is also, as it happens, a member of the Human Rights Council. Nevertheless, I imagine that Manfred Novak, in his report to the council the week after next, will be raising his visit to Indonesia. I will myself be at the council next week and hope to see Manfred Novak on the sidelines of that.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08022674000046"></a>I was asked what we are doing in terms of development support. We look at the governor of Papua who visited recently and saw the Minister in the Foreign Office who covers this region, Meg Munn. He is very involved in development activities  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_634"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 634</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and we have been supporting him as much as we can. We have funded human rights training for the police in Papua and supported security training for human rights defenders through the NGO Peace Brigades. In addition, DfID is providing funding for four development advisers to the governor of Papua. Their work will focus on poverty alleviation, public finance and infrastructure. DfID is also funding HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment activities in Papua as well as focusing on improving forest governance livelihoods to address poverty reduction and deforestation.</p>

<a name="80226-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08022674000047"></a>I think that we are as engaged as all the noble Lords who have spoken tonight would wish us to be. It is true that we are putting our confidence in this new democratic Government of Indonesia to live up to their responsibilities to their people. It is true that we continue, as have every British government, to accept the outcome of what happened in 1969. We recognise their shortcomings, but we believe that the way forward is an internal dialogue between the people of Papua and the Government in Jakarta. This is a process which delivered results in Aceh. We hope it can similarly deliver results for Papua. I will certainly express to my other colleagues in the Foreign Office the need that we continue in our dealings with the Government of Indonesia and President Yudhoyono to press the case for the people of Papua for human rights and justice and their right to a peaceful, prosperous development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08022674000073"></a>The noble Lord said: I can be extremely brief in introducing this amendment. Clause 17 amends Section 229 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with the assessment of dangerousness in connection with public protection sentences. As currently drafted, the amendment to Section 229 would allow the court to take into account information available to it about any previous United Kingdom convictions. My question is: what about convictions in other parts of the world? I beg to move.</p>

The background is that my right honourable friend the Minister of State with responsibility for justice, Mr Hanson MP, gave a commitment in the other place to consider an amendment in similar terms to this one. Government Amendment No. 89A, which is along similar lines to Amendment No. 89 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, is the result. We do not believe that the current clause prevents courts looking at foreign convictions&#151;where evidenced, of course&#151;when assessing risk, and obviously they would be sensible to do so. However, we accept that clarity would be helpful. In our view, government Amendment No. 89A puts beyond doubt that courts may consider not only UK but also overseas convictions in assessing risk. I hope that the noble Lord will support Amendment No. 89A.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08022674000132"></a>Section 282 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which provided for an increase in the maximum term that may be imposed on summary conviction of an offence triable either way, should come into force on the passing of this Act. In effect we are implementing a clause that originally appeared in the Government&#146;s 2003 Act but which has not been implemented. I think that, originally, the idea behind the clause was to supplement the custody-plus scheme, which was subsequently scrapped. However, we think that, quite independently of that scheme, it is right that magistrates be given the power to sentence for a term of up to 12 months.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08022674000083"></a>Just in case the Government might have some fears about the impact that that would have on prison places, I see no reason why the clause should lead to an increase. Magistrates sentence in accordance with the current sentencing framework, which is set out in statute. They use a structured decision-making process and consider the appropriate principles. All terms of custody must be justified by the seriousness of the offence. I am in no doubt that magistrates will use this new power responsibly. I beg to move.</p>

This is one of the few provisions of the 2003 Act not yet implemented, and we have no current plans to do so.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08022674000085"></a>Implementing the increase in sentencing powers separately from custody plus would be a major change to our sentencing framework and we are not persuaded that there is a strong case for making such a radical change. If the increased custody limit were implemented together with custody plus, the maximum actual custodial period that could be imposed by the magistrates&#146; court would be 13 weeks for one offence, which is the equivalent of the three months&#146; actual custody time that can currently be imposed. It was never envisaged that the magistrates&#146; courts would make use of the increased custodial sentencing power without custody plus.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08022674000086"></a>The new clause would mean a substantial increase in the magistrates&#146; ability to impose actual prison time; indeed it would be doubled. As I said, it would be a major change to increase the sentencing powers of the magistrates&#146; courts in this way. They are, after all, lay courts and are not intended to deal with the most serious and dangerous offenders who may require long custodial sentences. That is not in any way to disparage the magistracy, who remain a vital part of our criminal justice system and whose committed hard work, as all noble Lords know, is voluntary and deals with huge numbers of criminal cases.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08022674000087"></a>The current system ensures that defendants receive appropriate sentences. Magistrates&#146; courts can of course direct cases to the Crown Court when they assess that the defendant would be likely if convicted to require a heavier sentence than they are empowered to give. They can also commit a defendant who has been convicted to the Crown Court for sentence. Clause 103 ensures that the latter power will be available undiminished under Schedule 3 to the 2003 Act when it is implemented. In those circumstances, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

There are advantages in magistrates rather than the Crown Court dealing with these matters. Given that offences are triable either way, it is only right that the magistrates should have larger powers of sentencing than they would otherwise have. The logic behind my amendment is extremely powerful. I am disappointed by the Minister&#146;s reaction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08022674000089"></a>The fact that this was originally in the 2003 Act gives rise to the question of how much of that Act is still unimplemented.

I am sure that the Government are extremely disappointed after having put so much effort into what was the flagship of their criminal justice strategy in the early 1990s.

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08022674000094"></a>The noble Lord said: This is not as dramatic a proposal as my previous one. It is a more nuanced approach to a provision in the Bill concerning consecutive terms of imprisonment. We suggest that the Government kindly leave out Clause 20 and insert this new clause. It is simply another attempt to encourage the Government to give the courts greater discretion than they appear inclined to do. We are perfectly content to abide by the Government&#146;s maximum of 65 weeks but, within that, the Government should give the court clear discretion to set the appropriate length of sentence. That would include the power to suspend all or part of the total period. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08022674000095"></a><b><a name="80226-0014.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08022674000290"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I hope to respond in as nuanced a way as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, moved his amendment. Our Clause 20 is intended to provide a solution to the problem that, under the current custody-plus legislation&#151;which, I repeat, is not in force yet, before anyone else says it&#151;a court cannot impose more than 13 weeks&#146; custody for consecutive offences without exceeding limitations on what must be the licence portion of custody plus. It would enable the courts to put into practice an option which theoretically is available to them when sentencing for more than one offence: the option to impose 26 rather than 13 weeks&#146; custody and 26 weeks on licence in order to preserve the rehabilitative benefits of custody plus.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08022674000096"></a>The amendment would remove Clause 20 altogether and replace it with a new formulation. It would remove entirely the current restriction on the amount of the aggregated sentence that can be dedicated to custody. I understand that the intended effect is that the courts would not be limited at all in putting together consecutive custodial sentences and would be able to add them together until the threshold of 65 weeks had been reached, meaning that an offender could be sentenced to 65 weeks&#146; prison time if enough offences were sentenced together.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08022674000097"></a>Our difficulty with the amendment is that the new clause would pretty directly undermine the custody-plus concept. It would mean that the court could disregard entirely the need for a licence period, or could significantly reduce it. The long-term, post-custody licence is the key feature of custody plus, allowing these offenders to be supported and supervised in the community on release. That does not, as I understand it, happen for short prison sentences in any event, and is one problem with which this Committee&#151;and beyond the Committee, if I may say so&#151;has attempted to battle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08022674000098"></a>The proposed new clause would also introduce a substantial change to our sentencing framework by increasing the magistrates&#146; ability to impose actual prison time, which is currently six months for consecutive offences. Under custody plus, 26 weeks will be the maximum figure, which is the same. When magistrates&#146; courts assess that the defendant would be likely, if convicted, to require a heavier sentence than they are empowered to give, they can direct cases to the Crown Court. As I said in response to the previous amendment, they also have the power to commit a defendant for sentence to the Crown Court.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08022674000099"></a>The proposed new clause would also allow these sentences to be suspended. That is unnecessary. As the law stands, consecutive sentences may be suspended anyway, but in case anyone had forgotten, we have just debated the wider issue of the offences for which sentence may be suspended.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08022674000100"></a>I pause briefly to pay tribute to the work of the magistrates. All Members of the Committee, on whatever side they sit, know that magistrates play a vital role. They deal with 95 per cent of all criminal cases, either in the adult court or in the youth court. My noble friend Lord Hunt mentioned the 30,000 magistrates who serve voluntarily, giving their time freely in the name of public service and with commitment and dedication. I am sure that, in paying tribute to them, I do so on behalf of the whole Committee.</p>

That is surely not the case. I do not need to say all the things that the noble Lord has said about the magistrates for it to be absolutely clear that we on this side of the Committee are sterling supporters of the magistracy, and have been since time immemorial.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08022674000102"></a>I confess that I had not understood that the clause had custody plus in mind. The whole basis of the Minister&#146;s response to me is that custody plus is a policy that is still up and running, and that the Government intend to implement as soon as possible. That, as I understand it, is the tenor of his response.</p>

Another reason is that we do not believe that the magistrates&#146; powers should be given to pass a sentence of up to 65 weeks&#146; custody. I hope that that was clear from our objection to the noble Lord&#146;s last amendment to raise the maximum sentence for a single offence from six months. Everyone knows that the maximum sentence that the magistrates can impose for however many offences they deal with is a total of 12 months; in other words, 52 weeks.</p>

We are concerned at the proposal to credit time spent on an electronic tag against a subsequent custodial sentence. Bail conditions are not imposed as punishment and cannot be considered as part of an eventual sentence. </p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08022674000118"></a>A qualifying curfew condition requires a curfew of not less than nine hours, so one of, say, eight and a half hours from 9.30 in the evening to 6 o&#146;clock in the morning would accrue no credit. This could lead defence solicitors to ask for longer curfew periods where a custodial sentence is likely, or for a reduction in, say, the unpaid work requirement. Often a court is invited to consider a condition to reside at a bail hostel and abide by the conditions at the hostel. This can be a far more onerous condition than a curfew with electronic tagging as the offender is removed from their home. However, such a condition would not be credited&#151;nor, indeed, should it be.</p>

<a name="80226-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08022674000119"></a>I am puzzled by these clauses. The Government must be aware that the public will not warm to this proposal. As someone who is tagged with curfew conditions will be able to live at home, they may well be living in great comfort. Why should that period be set against any ultimate custodial sentence?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08022674000122"></a>Clauses 21 to 23, as the noble Lord said, give effect to a measure that was recommended by my noble friend Lord Carter in his review of prisons to help manage demand for prison spaces. They introduce a new provision in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to provide that time spent on bail, while subject to an  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_643"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column 643</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>electronically monitored curfew, may be credited towards a subsequent custodial sentence imposed for that offence. It will apply to defendants, bailed under the Bail Act as amended by the Bill, who are subject to an electronically monitored curfew bail condition and who have been sentenced for an offence that was committed on or after 4 April 2005. To qualify for the curfew credit, defendants must have been subject, as the noble Lord said, to an electronically monitored curfew for at least nine hours a day. The court will be required to take into account the defendant&#146;s compliance with the curfew when deciding the period to be credited.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80226-0015.htm"/>


<a name="80226-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08022674000123"></a>As I said, this will have an impact regarding the demand on prison places. The justification for the change in the Bill is really to reflect the position that being subject to a curfew does not equal a deprivation of liberty whereas remand to custody clearly does. That is why each curfew day will provide a potential credit against sentence of no more than half a day. This credit is not being made on the basis that defendants are being deprived of their liberty, but it is a credit for the fact that they have complied with their bail conditions while having their liberty restricted on a preventive, rather than a punitive, basis. The credit is made on the basis that, even though being under a curfew is less arduous than being in custody, both are intended as a preventive measure to secure the judicial process rather than as a measure designed to punish the offender.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08022674000124"></a>The noble Lord suggested that the nine hours might provide a perverse incentive. I certainly hope not. The question, &#147;Why nine hours, with no credit for shorter periods?&#148; was implicit in what he said. It would be too complicated to relate credit to the number of hours that an offender was subject to curfew with electronic monitoring. There has to be a cut-off point and we think nine hours is appropriate, bearing in mind the degree to which the curfew impinges on the defendant&#146;s daily life.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08022674000125"></a>The noble Lord asked why credit could not be given for other bail conditions, such as residence requirements. We consider that the level of restriction imposed by an electronically monitored curfew is greater than those other requirements. Where there are difficulties about evidencing compliance, such restrictions are often coupled with an electronically monitored curfew where credit would be given.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08022674000126"></a>Ultimately, we see this as a useful measure. It will help with some of the issues we have with the prison population. It can also be seen as a sensible preventative measure with regard to encouraging people who have been remanded on bail. On that basis, I commend it to your Lordships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08022681000007"></a>The noble Lord said: We come now to Clause 27 and the removal of foreign nationals. I hope we can have a constructive debate, because I think we share the Government&#146;s approach to this matter. There are over 10,000 foreign nationals in prison in the United Kingdom at the moment, which is a substantial percentage of the total number of those in prison, although deportation went up last year. The figure quoted in another place was that last year 2,784 prisoners were transferred out. The right honourable gentleman Mr Hanson said in November that we were on target to meet the Prime Minister&#146;s aim of removing 4,000 prisoners from England and Wales that year. I do not know if the Minister can tell us whether that target was met. It may be a bit early to reach any conclusions, but plainly the Government are keen to increase the number of prisoners who are sent back to their country of origin or to some other place beyond our borders.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08022681000008"></a>Interestingly, some nationalities are represented quite powerfully in our prisons. I understand that there are more than 1,300 Jamaican prisoners, over 1,000 Nigerian prisoners, nearly 500 prisoners from Vietnam, nearly 400 from Somalia and around 375 from China. Some countries have a particularly large number of their nationals in prison here in the United Kingdom. We have, as I understand it, agreements with 97 countries to repatriate prisoners to serve sentences in their home countries. These countries range from Albania and Australia to Venezuela and Ukraine. However, I believe that it is a condition of those agreements that the prisoner has to agree to leave the United Kingdom to serve his or her term of imprisonment in his own country. Those agreements are of some importance but they operate only with the co-operation of the prisoner. We cannot, under one of those agreements, force somebody to go back to their own country and serve their term of imprisonment there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08022681000009"></a>The thing that is exercising me is to what extent the problems we face in this area are legal problems and to what extent they are administrative problems. As I

They are dedicated exclusively to housing foreign nationals who have not yet completed their sentence and foreign nationals who have completed their sentence but who have been detained pending deportation.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08022681000010"></a>It is clear that we face a much more difficult problem with those prisoners who are members of EU countries than in other cases because, as your Lordships will know, various rights under EU treaties give citizens from other member states rights to enter and remain in this country for an indefinite period. There is a certain futility about deporting this class of prisoner because they can come back the next day under EU treaties. But of course that does not apply to those who are not citizens of the EU, and it is on those that we need to focus in this debate.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08022681000011"></a>It is plain that there has been discordance between the immigration authorities and those who are responsible for the management of prisons about the movement of these people, particularly regarding when they are likely to be released from prison. The authorities have been extremely slow to act to ensure that anybody who is liable to deportation is properly monitored before the appropriate measures are taken. I want to be clear how confident your Lordships' House can be about the measures that the Government wish to put in place. With those introductory remarks, I beg to move.</p>

On a number of occasions in this House we have debated the problems posed in prisons by foreign national prisoners, particularly in regard to deportation, because deportation is part of their sentence. It is not something that has to be waited for or applied for; it is in the sentence. It has always seemed extraordinary to me that the deportation process does not take place during the period of the sentence so that, when the sentence comes to an end, the prisoner makes one move from the prison to the airport and out.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08022681000013"></a>At the moment, because the deportation is not being processed during the prisoner&#146;s time in prison, he is moved at the end of his sentence to a deportation centre or to an immigration centre&#151;not the same place at all; prison rules do not apply there. The people who run these immigration centres tell me that up to 50 per cent of the people they have there are ex-prisoners awaiting deportation. If you go into the reasons for the various disturbances in places such as Yarlswood and Harmondsworth, you find that many of them were provoked by these frustrated ex-prisoners not knowing quite what is happening.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08022681000014"></a>I had hoped, in the context of a Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, that the Government would take the opportunity to clarify that and make it certain that procedures were in place; namely, that administrative procedures of deportation should be completed before the end of the sentence, so that there is no delay in the deportation process. As currently drafted, I cannot see that this clause will do anything to help either the prison or the immigration

I will start with the figures I have, showing the foreign national prisoner population rising from just over 4,500 in 1997 to just about 11,300 in December 2007, which is about 14 per cent of the total prison population. Although the number of foreign national prisoners has clearly risen considerably, I understand that the proportion held here is lower than in other major European Union countries, but that does not take away the problems that we face at the moment. I will echo the figures that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to concerning the numbers from particular countries. From Jamaica, it is 1,278; from Nigeria, 1,146; from Vietnam, 460; from Pakistan, 406; from Somalia, 394 and from China, 386.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08022681000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked about prisoner transfer agreements. It is true that it remains a voluntary process, which accounts for the small number of foreign national prisoners who were repatriated last year under such agreements; that stood at 111. The UK currently has prisoner transfer agreements with 98 countries and territories. We have negotiations for further bilateral agreements with Vietnam, Ghana, Libya, Nigeria, Botswana and Kenya. I understand that we hope to begin negotiations with China later this year; agreements with Jamaica and Pakistan were signed in 2007, and are subject to ratification. We expect the agreement with Pakistan to enter into force early this year, while the Jamaican agreement cannot enter into force until amendments have been made to Jamaican law.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08022681000017"></a>On consent, in 2006 Parliament amended the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984 to remove the need for prisoners to consent to transfer. Prisoner consent is still required under all our existing agreements, but the Government intend to seek to put in place future agreements that do not require that. The success of it will depend largely on the willingness of other countries to enter into such agreements.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08022681000018"></a>One needs to acknowledge the fact that, notwithstanding all of the problems that have been faced, a great deal of progress has been made in the past year. For instance, sustained improvements to the deportation system over the past 18 months have seen the Border and Immigration Agency deliver a record performance. More foreign national prisoners are leaving the country than ever before. I have the figures for 2007, showing that we are removing or deporting foreign national prisoners at a record rate. Some 4,200 were removed then, an increase of almost 80 per cent on the previous year.</p>

<a name="80226-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08022681000019"></a>I accept that time-served foreign national prisoners cause particular problems to prisons, because such prisoners are required to be treated as equivalent to remand prisoners and often cannot be moved quickly to the detention estate. That means that they suffer uncertainty about their removal dates, which can lead to distress or disorder.</p>

Could he say something more on uncertainty about removal dates? To take up the extremely helpful contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, surely it should be possible for a certain amount of planning to take place when the prison sentence of someone who has also been sentenced to deportation is approaching its end. I am not sure whether the planning should be done by either the Border and Immigration Agency or the Prison Service, or perhaps by both in tandem; but surely the planning could be done two or three months before the sentence ends so that there is a quick passage from the ending of the sentence to the deportation. Why is it necessary for these people to go through long periods of uncertainty before they finally leave the country? This seems to be a crucial part of the story.</p>

There is a protocol of agreement between the Prison Service and the Border and Immigration Agency. Sometimes there can be distinct problems because there is, for example, a lack of space in the immigration detention estate. I understand that transfers of time-served foreign national prisoners to immigration removal centres take place daily. However, due to the nature of the offences and behaviour of some individuals, it is sometimes necessary for them to remain in prison accommodation for security and control reasons. So there can be practical issues as well.</p>

I am most grateful to him for offering to send this protocol. I am sure that I shall find it most interesting reading. I understand that certain prisoners need to be kept in secure accommodation until the last minute. Nevertheless, it ought to be possible within, say, a week of the ending of a prison sentence for a person to be deported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08022681000026"></a>In those circumstances, there would not be an excessive demand on space, either in prison accommodation or other secure accommodation which is specifically tasked for potential deportees.

If I was nodding, it was to agree with him that we need to do everything we can to make the system as efficient as possible. I agree with that. I do think that we are making progress, but I do not think one can simply say that there are administrative issues. There are some real practical issues as well. I would commend those services in their approach. The clause helps in a modest way, but I am certainly happy, along with the protocol, to write to the noble Lord with further details about how we think we can deal with those specific problems if he would like that.</p>

<h4 align="center"><a name="08022643000004"></a>The Committee met at half-past three.</h4>


<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>

<p><a name="08022643000007"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08022643000065"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000008"></a>The noble Lord said: I am happy to confirm to the Committee that these provisions are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000009"></a>The purpose of the regulations, which are being made under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) Act 1979, is to increase by 3.9 per cent the amount of compensation paid under the Act. The increased amount will apply to those who first satisfy the conditions of entitlement on or after 1 April 2008.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000010"></a>Increasing the amounts paid under this scheme fulfils the undertaking given by this Government to increase these payments annually. There is no legislative requirement for the amounts paid under this scheme to be increased annually but we believe that it is right that they are so increased. This was a decision we were pleased to make when responsibility for the scheme was transferred to the Department for Work and Pensions in 2003.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000011"></a>It may be helpful if I briefly set out the purpose of the Act. An employee can sue his employer when he suffers from a disease that he contracted from his work with that employer. However, the diseases covered by this Act are known as long latency diseases, as they take a long time to develop. This can mean that they may not be diagnosed for a very long time after exposure to the dust. In most cases, this is more than 20 years, although it can take much longer. It is not surprising that by the time of diagnosis the employer, or employers, responsible may no longer exist. Sufferers and their dependants can therefore have great difficulty in obtaining compensation.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000012"></a>The Act provides for lump-sum payments to be made to sufferers based on the age of the sufferer and the level of disability. Higher amounts are paid to  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people with higher levels of disability and where the disability arises at an early age. Currently, the average payment to sufferers is around &#163;18,000. A claim can also be made by the sufferer&#146;s dependants after his death, but in this case a lesser amount is paid. The average payment to dependants is currently around &#163;6,000.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000013"></a>Three conditions must be satisfied before any payment can be made. First, the sufferer must be entitled to industrial injuries disablement benefit. Secondly, there must be no relevant employer who can be sued. Finally, no court action can have been brought, nor any compensation received, in respect of any of the diseases for which a person is claiming under the Act.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000014"></a>The Act covers five respiratory diseases, most of which are directly related to asbestos exposure. These are: mesothelioma; pneumoconiosis, which includes asbestosis; diffuse pleural thickening; primary carcinoma of the lung; and byssinosis. It is worth emphasising that these lump-sum payments are in addition to a weekly payment of industrial injuries disablement benefit.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000015"></a>Almost 80 per cent of claims paid under this scheme are to those suffering from mesothelioma. This is an extremely severe form of cancer and is invariably terminal within a short time.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000016"></a>Last year, this Government reaffirmed their commitment to look into all aspects of the current industrial injuries disablement benefit schemes. As a result, a consultation document was published on  29 January 2007 giving people the opportunity to help to shape future provision for those who are injured or made ill by their work. The consultation ended on  22 April 2007 and a report summarising the responses to it was published on the DWP website in June. The consultation process did not commit the DWP to any particular line of action. We are carefully considering several options put to us by officials.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000017"></a>Members will probably also be aware that a separate consultation exercise took place concerning the level of support for people suffering from mesothelioma. Current provision under the 1979 Act is limited to those who were exposed at work. Many people have been exposed to asbestos outside the workplace or through a relative who worked with asbestos. To address that, we are introducing a new lump-sum payment scheme in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill. This removes the condition that a person must be entitled to industrial injuries disablement benefit in order to be entitled to a lump sum.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000018"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022643000066"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I support what my noble friend proposes; surely these are welcome developments. However, is he able to say how many sufferers from asbestosis are drawing moneys? Will he be able to tell me at a later time?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000020"></a>I was referring to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, and explaining that it provides support for the first time to people who have not contracted mesothelioma as a result of their work. I expect that new scheme to be operative later this year. Our intention is that payments under the scheme will be made within six weeks of the date of claim. That ensures, as far as we can, that the sufferers get some payment during their life. Where that is not possible it will at least provide monetary compensation for their dependants.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000021"></a>Finally&#151;I know we all agree here&#151;no amount of money will ever compensate these sufferers or their families. However, these regulations help us to ensure that the compensation provided in the original Act maintains its value. I commend the uprating of the payment scales to Members of the Committee, and will deal with the specific point raised by my noble friend and other comments made when I wind up. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Jones, mentioned one of the diseases that might be classified under the label here of &#147;etc&#148;&#151;asbestosis. I seem to remember that, 32 years ago, I had occasion to speak on compensation for three associated diseases&#151;pneumoconiosis, asbestosis and another dreadful disease called byssinosis. Did the Minister mention byssinosis? It seemed to be one of the three associated diseases that would be covered by the regulations. Am I right?</p>

As a good accountant, I shall no doubt listen to the details of whether there is the same compensation for all the diseases or whether it is different for some of them; I suspect that the population of unfortunate sufferers from these three or five diseases will have varying numbers according to the severity of the disease. I would be pleased if he let me have that information in a note in due course, and I shall make way for much more important speakers than myself.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>congratulated on what they have done in the recent past. It has taken a long time to get here, and there has been a lot of suffering, but we are beginning to get on top of it now. That is extremely welcome.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000029"></a>I shall make three points. The first is about indexation, which is the most readily available means of making sure that these payments do not fall behind earnings and retail price increases. That is a sensible way of making progress on benefits that are merely about money, but payments of this kind depend so much on the medical conditions, the background and the context in which the awards are given and in which the amounts are paid. I know that under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 there is a duty on the Government to look at indexation in respect of certain benefits. I wonder whether just looking at the numbers is enough. I would like an assurance that there is a medical dimension to the investigation that goes on before a final decision about the level of the annual uprating is made by Ministers. Medical science may make progress, or we may discover more and more that these terrible illnesses are more severe than we originally thought. Can we have an assurance that the uprating calculation is more than merely financial and that thought is given to some of the medical dimensions to the problem?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000030"></a>Secondly, I know the department inherited the scheme in 2003, and I have no evidence to think that it has any problems with it. However, like other Members of the Committee, I am all too well aware that the constraints of the Comprehensive Spending Review on the departmental spending envelope for 2008-11 mean that the administrative pressure under which the department will be administering some of these schemes will increase. Can we have an assurance that there will be no delays in assessments, payments or the processing of the applications? There are Members of the Committee who spent a lot longer than me campaigning honourably and gallantly for this system to be set up. I would not like to think that delays might happen just because we are not watching urgently and clearly enough to see that the falling Civil Service headcount, administrative back-up and resources available to the department mean that there is slippage in the consideration of claims. That would be unfortunate, particularly with regard to the severity of the conditions of some of the claimants and the long road they have had to get to the scheme as it currently is.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000031"></a>Finally, I do not know the answer to this question, so it is a dangerous kind of question to ask. Is there co-ordination with the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales? There are some differences in the way that NICE in England and its equivalent north of the border deal with some of the treatments and with the more medical dimensions of the background to this problem. I guess that in Wales and in some of the former shipyard areas of Scotland there is potentially a much higher incidence of some of these diseases, and I would like to think that this scheme is being run in close co-ordination so that best practice and maximum assistance can be given through a co-ordinated drive to try to make this scheme as successful as it should be.   


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is an important scheme. The Government deserve credit for setting it up and for the state it is in. I am sure we are all on the same side in striving to make it even better in future.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000032"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08022643000074"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I, too, am grateful for the details given by the Minister, and I am glad to follow the informed remarks of the noble Lord who speaks for the Liberal Democrats. In the south Wales coalfield there is huge interest in these matters even today. The interest is clearly based on the experience of tens of thousands of miners who need these regulations.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000033"></a>I pay tribute to the magnificent work done in another place by many Members of Parliament over many years to obtain the payments that are now coming forward. The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, mentioned asbestosis. It might help your Lordships if I remind the Grand Committee that, in the early 1980s, the late right honourable Lord Harold Walker had charge on the opposition Front Bench of matters relating to asbestosis. I had the privilege of working with him, and we both worked under the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Varley. I simply make these remarks to help put these excellent regulations into context. Departments, which work for many years and months on the production of regulations such as these, may be able to have a slight historic context to work by in the future.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000034"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08022643000075"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> It is obvious from the remarks that have been made by all noble Lords that the whole Committee is extremely grateful to the Minister for explaining these regulations to us. One of the problems of speaking last, even in a short debate such as this, is that much of one&#146;s thunder has already been stolen. On these occasions I have a regular question for the Minister who is to respond, which I will come to in a minute.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000035"></a>The horrendous diseases to which these regulations refer are all ailments of the lung occasioned either by mining or by the inhalation of asbestos fibres, which may or may not be accompanied in the case of pneumoconiosis by tuberculosis.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000036"></a>I was rapidly looking through last year&#146;s <I>Hansard </I>of this debate when the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, was speaking because I seem to remember being told some years ago that the claims were only fractionally greater than the successful payments in these cases of the diseases we are discussing today. Perhaps the Minister could confirm that. I seem to remember that in the year in question there was something in the order of 2 per cent in it.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000037"></a>As we have heard, the regulations uprate the statutory compensation scheme by 3.9 per cent to maintain alignment with other social security benefits, which we will deal with later. Although the Government do not have to increase the rates of payments, they said shortly after coming into office that they would do so. So, here we are again and I and thousands of sufferers appreciate very much their so doing.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000038"></a>However, it occurs to me that with the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill currently going through Parliament, with Part 4 covering mesothelioma

It would not be beyond the wit of the draftsman to change both the parent Act of these regulations and the Social Security Administration Act to achieve this objective. I might even be tempted to do it myself, given the unlikely nod and wink from the Minister. Whatever the response to that suggestion, my track record of favourable responses from Ministers in the DWP is far from first class.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000039"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Jones, and my noble friend Lord Lyell&#151;although I would not be quite as specific as they were in referring to particular diseases covered by the regulations&#151;I would be grateful to know how many claims there were last year. Although I appreciate that, for many of the diseases we are considering, people may suffer for many years&#151;pneumoconiosis, for example, may last for 40 years&#151;the trouble is that it is identified only at the very last moment; at that point, there can be death within months. I would therefore expect the number of claimants to decrease over time. Has that decrease yet manifested itself?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000040"></a>I note that last year, the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin, who spoke for the DWP on a similar order, referred to the,</p>
<ul><a name="08022643000061"></a>&#147;dangerous effects of asbestos, and that awareness and knowledge came into play only after large numbers of people had been exposed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/2/08; col. GC 140.]</ul>
<p><a name="08022643000060"></a>There is a latent period, as I have said.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000041"></a>In the debate in another place last week there was a question about why pleural thickening was compensable when pleural plaques were not. Although I am advised that the former can kill whereas the latter are symptomatic, I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s answer&#151;not least because the subject of pleural plaques exercises the minds of some Members of another place and one or two noble Lords with regard to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000042"></a>Finally, I am pleased to repeat that I support the regulations.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000044"></a>First, on the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, on the number of claims, the position is that total claims received up to March 2007 are 27,101, while the total claims paid to that date are 19,214. The issue is that those are lump-sum payments; there is no continuing payment beyond that lump sum.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000045"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones asked about the overall statistics. I do not have the overall data on the number of people claiming industrial injuries disablement benefit, but I shall write to him on that.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000046"></a>On the scale of annual incidence, focusing on claims for mesothelioma, which represents 70 per cent of the total number of claims made under this scheme, in 2005 there were 2,037 deaths. The

That will give the noble Lord some idea of the scale, but I shall write with more specific information.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000047"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08022643000077"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend for handling my query. He may know that the nation first took an interest with urgency in the problem of asbestosis when it became clear in the late 1960s that a workforce in a factory in Hebden Bridge literally played snowballs, as it were, with blue asbestos. It was from thereon that the tragedy that is now unfolding had its origins, in part at least. That is why I wished to pay tribute to the late Lord Harold Walker, because I saw the passion and insight with which he made his case. I also saw Ministers for the Administration of the day responding as well as they could.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000048"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="08022643000078"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank my noble friend for that information. I take this opportunity to acknowledge, and thank him for, the campaigning work that he has done in this area. He talked particularly about the impact of this legislation on miners. Previously, miners have been able to access the 1974 scheme, which is different from the one before us today, but following the dissolution of the British Coal Corporation on 27 March 2004 it became possible for miners to access compensation under the 1979 Act scheme as well, although there are some issues about how that works.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000049"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08022643000079"></a>Lord Jones:</b> Again, I am grateful. My noble friend reminds me that when I served under Prime Minister Harold Wilson in his fourth Administration in 1975, I received a deputation from the South Wales Miners led by Emlyn Williams. He made the case for what eventually became these very payments. Again, I use the word &#147;passion&#148;. His delegation knew what the problems were in the valleys of south Wales, from the anthracite fields in the west through to the eastern valleys. Of course, these problems did not simply relate to south Wales; they could also be found in the north in parts, but they largely related to the south Wales valleys.</p>

It is a key bit of Labour history which some of us read about in books in the 1970s, and to hear directly from someone who was engaged in that and worked with a great Prime Minister as well is indeed fascinating.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022643000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, asked which diseases were covered. I confirm that byssinosis is covered. He asked specifically whether the same rates were applicable to each of the diseases. As I explained, the rate of compensation is determined in part by the age of the sufferer and the degree of disability that the disease demonstrates, although mesothelioma is always compensable at the highest rate of 100 per cent. However, generally the same tables apply to all the five conditions that I listed. I hope that that deals with the noble Lord&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about indexation. I reiterate that there is no statutory requirement for this, although there is a government commitment to it. I think that that commitment is clearly on the record and we do not necessarily need to embody it in legislation. The change is driven by the RPI adjustment; there is no reassessment along the way in terms of medical issues and evidence. The noble Lord asked for an assurance that pressures on the department would not impact on the claims process. I reassure him that, whatever pressures the department is under, they will not impact on administrative effectiveness in delivering the benefit.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000053"></a>I think that I dealt with the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about the total number of claims. He also asked about pleural plaques. A House of Lords judgment was recently handed down which concluded that pleural plaques, per se, were not compensable. The Government obviously had to consider long and hard whether to seek to legislate to overturn the impact of that judgment, and they have determined not to do so. That is not to say that someone suffering from pleural plaques who then developed a disease could not be compensated for that, but with regard to the existence of pleural plaques, the Government have accepted the House of Lords judgment in that case.</p>

Very often, Governments disapprove of rulings from your Lordships&#146; Judicial Committee and succeed in changing the law back to what everyone thought it was before legal colleagues&#151;I was going to say &#147;got at it&#148;, but &#147;interpreted it&#148; would be a better way of putting it.

I have actually read it; we had some representations on the matter, and it was very clear that the House of Lords determined that pleural plaques were not compensable on two grounds&#151;that the condition itself did not create compensable damage; and that the potential stress and anxiety that might flow from the existence of pleural plaques that might be indicative of exposure to asbestos was not compensable under basic provisions in the law. The Government reflected on and accepted that clear judgment. We obviously continue to engage with stakeholders on this and are listening carefully to representations about the matter. In particular, we are exploring how people who have been exposed to asbestos, of which the existence of pleural plaques is indicative, might be supported. We do not intend to override the judgment.</p>

<p><a name="08022643000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about devolved Administrations. Obviously this is a GB scheme so, so far as there is engagement in Scotland and Wales, we need to make sure that we have a robust system for the whole of Great Britain. I dealt with the point about administrative pressures and indexation. I think that I have dealt with all questions

<h5><a name="08022655000031"></a>4.03 pm</h5>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000003"></a>The noble Lord said: I believe that we are dealing with two orders, the second being the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2008. Both were laid before the House on 23 January. I am satisfied that the orders are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000004"></a>The uprating order will increase most national insurance benefits by the September 2007 retail prices index, which was 3.9 per cent. Most income-related benefits will be increased by the Rossi index, which as Members of the Committee will be aware is the retail prices index excluding rent, mortgage interest, council tax and depreciation, and was 2.3 per cent on the same date. The uprating order provides for increases to take effect, in most cases, in the week of 7 April.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000005"></a>The Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order 2008 sets out the amount by which contracted-out defined benefit schemes must increase members&#146; guaranteed minimum pensions that accrued between 1988 and 1997. This order will provide for an increase of 3 per cent. Primary legislation provides for increases to be capped at this level, when the retail prices index exceeds 3 per cent. This year&#146;s uprating adds nearly &#163;4 billion to government spending. I hope that noble Lords will agree that this will reinforce our commitment to build an active welfare state and to tackle poverty by helping those most in need.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000006"></a>The uprating order provides an extra &#163;2.8 billion to pensioners, of which &#163;240 million is above inflation.  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC124"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Today&#146;s pensioners are no more likely to be living in poverty than any other sector of society. Since 1997, pensioner poverty has been reduced by more than one-third through targeted support such as pension credit and around &#163;11 billion extra funding. We have lifted more than 1 million pensioners out of relative poverty. In 1997, the poorest pensioners lived on &#163;69 a week. From April, pension credit means that no single pensioner will need to live on less than &#163;124 a week and that couples need not live on less than &#163;189.35 a week. Around 2.7 million pensioner households, which is 3.3 million individuals, receive pension credit, with an average weekly award of &#163;50. Because of our reforms, pensioner households will be an average of &#163;1,500 better off in 2007-08 than they would have been had the 1997 system stayed in place.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000007"></a>My honourable friend in the other place has announced a package of measures that will simplify the state pension system and encourage take-up. The changes will make the system less confusing and intrusive. A simplified and integrated process has already been introduced to make pension credit and state pension easier to claim, but this will be extended further to include housing benefit and council tax benefit&#151;four benefits in one call&#151;without the need for the customer to sign and return a claim form. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that this improvement to simplify claiming council tax benefit in particular should help to increase take-up of that benefit. We recognise there are those who, for a variety of reasons do not claim. We are therefore working jointly with Help the Aged, Age Concern, Citizens Advice and other partners to encourage pensioners to apply for benefits, targeting those areas where take-up is low and helping thousands more pensioners out of poverty.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000008"></a>We will also uprate benefits and allowances for the working population. The order provides for an extra &#163;630 million for disabled people and carers, and an extra &#163;420 million for those of working age. Child-related allowances paid in the income-related benefits will be increased in parallel with the child tax credits to ensure that families getting these benefits see the full value of increases in child tax credits. In particular, the allowance paid for a child dependant in the income-related benefits will from next April increase by &#163;5.14 a week to &#163;52.59&#151;almost 11 per cent. This shows our commitment to provide increased financial support for low- and moderate-income families. Tax credits currently benefit nearly  6 million families and 10 million children.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000009"></a>This year&#146;s uprating has provided an opportunity to provide extra help to some vulnerable teenagers as well as simplifying the benefit structure. From next April, the single-person rate for the small number of 16 and 17 year-olds getting income support and jobseeker&#146;s allowance will be the same as the rate for 18 to 24 year-olds. This will mean an increase of &#163;12.30, uplifting their weekly benefit from &#163;35.65 to &#163;47.95. The number of people in work is at record level at 29.4 million, and 1 million fewer people get out-of-work benefits than in 1997. The New Deal has helped more than 1.7 million people into work; this includes over 764,000 young people and more than 300,000 long-term unemployed adults. The New Deal

I am not sure about the detail, but it appears to me&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08022655000013"></a>[<I>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the</I><I> House from 4.12 to 4.18</I><I> pm.</I>]</p>

<p><a name="08022655000014"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08022655000035"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> Before the Division, I was raising one or two questions about the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order. Do the Government have any plans to look at ways of getting rid of the guaranteed minimum pension? It is now a rump. I know that entitlements accrued between 1987 and the early 1990s, which I do not diminish, but it is an awkward hangover from an earlier time. They cost a lot of money to administer. I am told by people who have to do the actuarial work for them that they are fiendishly complicated and boring for them. Those few employers who still run the defined benefit schemes have to pay an enormous additional cost, because of the failure fully to uprate guaranteed minimum pensions by indexation and the cap. That is a further burden on employers. With pensions legislation coming thick and fast through your Lordships&#146; House, and if it is possible to apply a little creativity, we should undertake a thorough review of the way in which the GMP system works. Review and reform are long overdue.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000015"></a>A number of colleagues who are involved in the pensions field complain that information from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the National Insurance Contributions Office has often been unacceptably misleading and incorrect in the past, which causes great problems for employers who run the schemes. It is an urgent problem which I hope that the Minister will say he will address.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000016"></a>I turn in the main to the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2008. I could speak without hesitation, deviation and even repetition for a long time about all this, because I have spoken to one such order per year since 1983. They do not get easier as you get older.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000017"></a>I shall say a word about the context. It is acknowledged that the Government have made a lot of progress. It is very easy to be blinded by big numbers, and we are dealing with big numbers in the  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>social security system. We are using the September 2007 retail prices index figure, and I could persuade Members of the Committee that things have changed quite a bit since September. I am sure that noble Lords have seen the figures about energy costs that I have recently seen. They suggest that fuel inflation over the recent past was nearly 20 per cent&#151;19.3 per cent. Fuel, particularly domestic heating fuel, cannot be avoided in a poorer family or household, and that is a worrying level of increase. Reading the commodity pages of the quality national press, it is obvious that in the next few months we will sustain quite substantial increases in basic food costs&#151;not just in raw material costs, but in processed foods costs as well.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000018"></a>Therefore, although I welcome this order and think that the Government have done much, I worry whether we are making proper provision for the next 12 months. I do not want to be gloom-laden or a doomster in any sense, but we could well be heading for a much more difficult period of economic growth. If that is the case, worklessness will increase, which will make it more difficult for the Government to attack their 80 per cent employment target. In addition, the costs of living will go up. Another factor that is now worse in the context of this uprating order than in many years in the past is the residual level of indebtedness in the economy. Many poorer households have unconscionable levels of credit card debts that are very difficult to sustain. The context in which these orders are being promoted by the Government is difficult. The economic situation is likely to get worse before it gets better.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000019"></a>Secondly, I know the Minister will play a straight bat and say that the Government can deliver it all with the level of departmental spending but, as I said earlier, I am really concerned that the 5 per cent saving and the Gershon cuts will make it nearly impossible to deliver the changes that are coming. We have a raft of Jobcentre Plus schemes, bit and pieces and pilots. Taken on their own, they are all welcome and I am not arguing against them, but I have serious reservations about whether the headcount and the resources available to the department between 2008 and 2011 will be able to administer the processes that deliver these benefits. It is all very well increasing the benefits, but if people do not get access to them or if there are barriers to access to them, there will be great difficulty for the people we are seeking to serve.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000020"></a>I could make a longer point about this, but I will not, because it plays into the consequential argument about complexity on which the Select Committee in the other place produced an excellent report. There is a simplification unit in the department, but I am still not convinced that its members are earning their pay, but if they meet me in the pub late at night they may tell me different. There is a real issue about complexity. The Social Security Advisory Committee captured it rather well when it said that there was still a,</p>
<ul><a name="08022655000030"></a>&#147;substantial barrier to full customer engagement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022655000029"></a>I think that that is right and that it will get worse because we are asking Mrs Strathie and the others who are running Jobcentre Plus and the pension credit system&#151;the whole pension system, indeed&#151;to

I acknowledge that there has been investment from the Treasury in the past, but I have some severe worries that the processes will fall over and that clients will not be served despite the increases in these orders.</p>

<p><a name="08022655000021"></a>In particular I want to mention two kinds of households and client groups. One is people in workless families without children. It is absolutely true that the Government can say that income support for pensioner households and for households with families with two and more children is higher relative to earnings than in the past. I was looking at some figures produced by the <I>Monitoring </I><I>Poverty and S</I><I>ocial </I><I>E</I><I>xclusion 2006</I> report. It confirms that that is the case. It also makes an important point which I want the Minister to go away and think about. It demonstrates to me without any peradventure or doubt that the level of support for working-age adults without children is much lower and getting worse. A graph on page 36 of that report demonstrates that very clearly.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000022"></a>The other thing the report says&#151;and I confess that I did not know this&#151;is that almost half of all adults relying on state benefits or of working age do not have dependent children; 46 per cent are of working age without children. That client group is very important to us, and to the Government because the whole act of labour market policy that is driving the Government&#146;s reforms&#151;and I am in favour of that&#151;is trying to get people into work. What if we are trying to get people into work and they find that they are actually worse off? The budget changes have made this worse because the 10 per cent tax rate&#151;if you do not have access to child tax credit, as you will not if you are a workless household&#151;means that the better-off calculation in terms of welfare to work is very much harder to make positive. I genuinely think that is a problem and that not enough is being done about that client group. I could go on at much greater length about that. I will not; I just make the point that it is a particular client group of families under these uprating orders who are being left behind.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000023"></a>The second group I want to mention in passing, and this is more familiar territory, is pensioner households and the whole question of take-up. I know that the Government have take-up schemes and that take-up schemes have come and gone in the past. There is now a structural problem about uprating and the stigma of take-up, both of pension credit and with housing benefit credit and council tax credit.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000024"></a>I was quite taken aback last week when I discovered in a press release from the Administration in Wales that it has now been calculated that up to &#163;100 million in council tax benefit goes unclaimed in Wales. Good for the Welsh devolved Administration for finding that out. They are spending &#163;3 million on a targeted take-up campaign. That is very welcome too. I know that the Government have got some plans to roll out some development of take-up schemes with associated organisations in the voluntary sector&#151;not-for-profit organisations&#151;but this is now urgent. A lot of the residual long-term poverty in our

That is a serious worry.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000025"></a>I have perhaps a penultimate point, and I have said this before. Uprating year to year is fine, but uprating over a 20-year period is dire for low-income households and social mobility. People have slipped behind earnings increases inexorably, year in and year out, over a 20-year period. We are intelligently positing some of the policy proposals over longer periods. The Government are right to look at their child poverty programme up to 2010-20, because it is only over those timescales that you can get hold of some of those issues properly.</p>
<h5><a name="08022655000032"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000026"></a>I did not have time to do the calculation but, to demonstrate the point about the erosion in the value of benefits, I should say that before I was elected to the House of Commons in 1991 I last calculated that the state pension was worth 23.7 per cent of average earnings. When the new Labour Government came to power in 1997, it was 17 per cent and at today&#146;s prices it is 15.4 per cent. I know the arguments better than anyone&#151;that it is not about a basic state pension but about pension credit, and that we will have guaranteed minimum payments and a savings element to the pension credit. I know all that, but every one of those benefits&#151;not only the basic state pension; it is not the best example and if I had had more time I could have chosen a better one&#151;is being eroded over time. That will continue over time, as long as we merely use RPI.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000027"></a>Incidentally, there is immense confusion about the plethora of different indices that are used. I get confused myself. We have RPI, RPI minus X, CPI, the Rossi index and other indices. Somebody should get hold of that, rationalise it and make it a lot more easily understood. Again on the point from the Social Security Advisory Committee, it is a substantial barrier to full customer engagement.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022655000028"></a>For all these reasons, these uprating orders are welcome so far as they go. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and I are always being held to account for expenditure claims that we make on behalf of our respective organisations. I pose an important question: are the Government going to use benefit uprating as a tool between now, 2010 and 2020 to bear down on child poverty? There are lots of welcome schemes that seek to do bits and pieces of that work, but personally I do not believe that it is possible to do this job properly without looking substantially afresh at how we uprate basic benefits. Means-testing and targeting were worth trying but have come through with all sorts of problems. This involves the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and I thinking hard too, because these are big numbers if you start to go above indexation of benefits, and you have to justify them. But if the Government are really serious about bearing down on child poverty and abolishing it by 2020, they will not do that unless they improve on the uprating orders that we have before us this afternoon, welcome as they are.</p>

However, can he say a little more on statutory paternity and adoption pay in Article 11? When did paternity pay become part of the system and when was that social history made? How many are drawing paternity pay? Are the numbers increasing?</p>

He may have noted, as I have these last several weeks, that the distinguished commentator Bagehot has been missing. When I turned to read the magazine this week, what did I see in small print? That Bagehot is on paternity.</p>

Time flies. I cannot remember whether it was four years ago or longer, but no doubt the Minister will be able to tell us in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Jones.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000006"></a>I do not intend to follow the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, except to say that I think that we are all determined that as many people as are fit enough should be in the world of work, but&#151;it is a big but; I go along with the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, on this&#151;they will not even try unless the recompense in wages or salary is more than the benefit that they got in the first place. For families with children that is comparatively easy, because of the families&#146; tax credit. For others, it becomes a lot more difficult, and is a lot more of a challenge for those of us making policy who have that objective.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000007"></a>Having said that, on behalf of my party, I am pleased to support the orders, which increase the main social security benefits and pensions by 3.9 per cent. Inflation is creeping up. I note that last year&#146;s increase was 3.6 per cent, and both those amounts relate to the retail prices index, which is rising. Given, as was pointed out in another place and today by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that the average RPI is not representative of &#147;individual&#148; household bills&#151;at least in the short term&#151;the increase is not seen to be sufficient for many. However, as there is an annual fixed point for recording inflation, and therefore using that amount to uprate year by year, people gain when household expenditure falls relative to the RPI. The question is whether the gains equate with the minuses. I do not know whether any work has been done on this on the 20-year period of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, but at some stage it would be extremely useful if the Minister could set his mind to write to us on exactly that subject.</p>

<p><a name="08022663000008"></a>The other income-related benefits are to be increased by the Rossi index, as the Minister said. That of course excludes rent, mortgage interest, council tax and&#151;for some unknown reason&#151;depreciation. I have never understood that; perhaps someone could take me quietly aside at some point  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and explain. Over the past year, this has been 2.3 per cent, which again will not be popular in some quarters through ignoring the point of the swings and roundabouts that I have just mentioned. It tends to be pensioners, through their lobby groups, who complain most about this. It would be helpful to know the Government&#146;s view.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000009"></a>Talking to pensioners brings me to the order that we are discussing in parallel, the guaranteed minimum pensions order. As the Minister said, where inflation is more than 3 per cent, the guaranteed minimum pensions indexation is capped at 3 per cent. Unlike my noble friend Lady Noakes&#151;she will be returning to the House tomorrow&#151;I am not a pensions guru, although I struggle hard to make some useful points. Therefore, with regard to a point just made, what effect does guaranteed minimum pension have on defined benefit pension schemes year by year? I can understand that in the past it has had some effect by dragging up the level of the minimum pension payable, but is that still the case, especially in the, alas, very rare defined benefit schemes? It would be useful to know that.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000010"></a>Accompanying these orders is the report of the Government Actuary&#151;or, rather, the acting one, Mr Johnston. I have not been able to check whether last year&#146;s Government Actuary&#146;s Department report said the same thing as we find in paragraph 4 of the conclusion; namely, the obvious fact that if economic conditions depart from the assumptions in paragraph 4.1, which I shall come to in a minute, then the balance of the National Insurance Fund, as of 31 March, will be different from the &#163;56.974 billion anticipated at the end of the financial year 2008-09. That may or may not be meant to sound a cautionary note but it is rather stating the obvious.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000011"></a>One of these imponderables must surely be the unemployment level, which is mentioned as a contributing factor in paragraph 4.1. The others in that paragraph are the employment level&#151;as opposed to the unemployment level&#151;which is expected to rise from 27.6 million in 2007-08 to 27.7 million in 2008-09. That is a modest increase indeed. The question arises as to where people are to come from to fill those extra 100,000 jobs. Does the Minister expect the Prime Minister&#146;s wish to be realised when he talks of British jobs for British workers, which, with the number of immigrants coming into this country, is what I would describe as patent nonsense? Those immigrants, of course, mainly come from EU countries, and there is nothing that this Government or indeed any other can do to stop them. The pass was sold years ago, although with the new accession countries, as they are called, it was under this Government&#146;s watch.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000012"></a>Another assumption that the acting Government Actuary makes is that the number of people unemployed and claiming benefit will be 840,000 on average in 2007-08, rising to 870,000 in 2008-09. We all know that the economy is slowing down but I am confused by these assumptions, because the most recent figures for unemployment that I have, which come from the Labour Force Survey, are 1,606,000 unemployed and 7.9 million defined as &#147;economically  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC131"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inactive&#148;. For the purposes of clearing up my confusion, what has happened to 810,000 people? Surely they cannot all be so self-sacrificing as not to claim benefit.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000013"></a>Finally, it used to be recognised that the prudent balance in the National Insurance Fund was one-sixth of expected expenditure. Mr Johnston reports that the surplus in the fund is likely to be well in excess of this at &#163;56,947,000 by the end of 2008-09. It is perhaps hardly surprising that the National Pensioners Convention has recognised this, commenting that the surplus has been rising by more than 2.45 times in the increase of expenditure. It has therefore called for a substantial increase in the state pension, and there was a report to that effect in a tiny paragraph in Saturday&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I>.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000014"></a>There are two points here on which I should like the Minister to respond. The first is that the fund covers a lot more than pensions; it includes jobseeker&#146;s allowance and incapacity benefits as well as pensions. The new pensions benefits, which are expected to be &#163;8.108 billion in 2008-09, are much more volatile than pensions and depend on assumptions which may or may not be realised.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000015"></a>I cannot discover what allowance has been made for longevity, although I note that total expenditure is increasing at a higher rate than the extra payments would warrant as a result of the uprating. This is the subject of the next order, so perhaps my remarks are out of place here. Nevertheless, I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response to the national convention, which I believe would be the first time that any Minister would be able to put such a response on the record. Not only I would be grateful, but I am sure that the convention would, too. With these questions, I approve the orders.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked why we cannot do away with the guaranteed minimum pension. The Pensions Act 2007 contains provisions which allow schemes to convert guaranteed minimum pension rights to normal scheme benefits so long as they are equivalent. That is a means of addressing the noble Lord&#146;s question. The provisions cover also the removal of contracting-out or defined contribution schemes, which is a welcome simplification of pension arrangements.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked what this was all about. Where there are defined benefit schemes&#151;previously, defined contribution schemes&#151;and a contracting-out of SERPS, the legislation required that those contracted-out schemes provided a guaranteed minimum pension which was broadly equivalent, although not identical, to SERPS. The provision requires those defined benefit and defined contribution schemes to maintain a pension that covers the SERPS from which people have withdrawn.</p>

The purpose of the uprating is to make sure that their value is maintained, with the right not to maintain them as a guaranteed minimum pension in the future but to build an actuarial equivalence into normal benefits being provided for in the legislation that we discussed extensively last year. Yes, there is a value. The order is about maintaining or preserving that, but giving schemes the choice to convert to equivalence, so that one no longer has to go through the detail and complexities of these calculations.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000022"></a>I hope that I have dealt with guaranteed minimum pensions. Perhaps I may deal next with the range of inflation measures. The noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Skelmersdale, were right that they are inevitably backward-looking, which is the only sensible way to approach them. There is a range of measures, such as RPI, Rossi, RPIX, which is retail prices less mortgage interest payments, and the consumer prices index, which is the main macroeconomic inflation indicator and commonly used internationally. Each has its role. Traditionally, we have used RPI for the upratings. For the 2008 uprating, the RPI is 3.9 per cent and the CPI is down at 1.8 per cent, so it was beneficial to individuals that we used the RPI figure. Of course, if there are cost increases in certain commodities after the announcement, during the course of the year before the next uprating there is inevitably a bit of a lag to that&#151;but it will be caught up when the next uprating takes place. The impact on energy prices needs to be seen also in the context of the Government&#146;s fuel poverty strategy, which has invested considerable amounts of money in targeting the most vulnerable and helping them to tackle fuel poverty; 1.6 million households have already been helped under the Government&#146;s Warm Front programme.</p>

<p><a name="08022663000028"></a>On the labour market, I did not quite follow the figures given by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and perhaps I need to study the record in detail.

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000033"></a>My next point goes to the heart of the point that both noble Lords made about working-age families without children and the challenges of living perpetually on benefit when it is uprated only by RPI. Yes, of course that is so&#151;which is why we placed so much emphasis and did so much work on the benefit of encouraging and supporting people into work, for a whole range of reasons. There is the whole issue around the health, work and well-being agenda&#151;that being in work is generally good for your health and being out of work is generally bad for your health. We know that it is the best route out of poverty, overwhelmingly for most families, which is why the investment has gone in, why we have the New Deal and why there have been the very dramatic improvements in the labour market statistics. The number of people in work is a record 29.36 million. ILO unemployment was down 13,000 on the last quarter and the number of out-of-work benefits have fallen by 1 million since 1997. Those are real and dramatic changes in the labour market, and we need to keep supporting people into work.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000034"></a>The greater emphasis will be achieved by integrating the skills and work agendas to make sure that people who come on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance have skills screening and the help that they need to improve their skills. Under the flexible New Deal, we want to make sure also that people have the benefit of

If one were to compare most in-work calculations with equivalent benefit calculations, one would see that people are overwhelmingly better off in work. I accept that that is not always well understood, although Jobcentre Plus will do a calculation as a routine part of a customer&#146;s experience. People sometimes forget that benefits such as council tax benefit and housing tax benefit are in-work as well as out-of-work benefits and do not necessarily factor them into the calculation. However, these are the challenges of helping people to understand and of supporting them into work.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, drew comparisons between the percentage levels of the basic state pension to show what they have been historically. He was right: the Government&#146;s approach when they came into office was to target resources on those who needed them most. We make no apology for that because of the paucity of provision for pensioners in 1997. It was absolutely right to do that. We know that we have spent more on pensions and invested more on pensioners than would have been the case if we had only uprated the basic state pension by earnings rather than prices. We would not have done better. Under the pension reforms last year and those that we shall discuss soon, we have put in place foundations to help more people access a full basic state pension and to relink the basic state pension with earnings in 2012 or the end of the next Parliament. Nor should we overlook the benefits of S2P and what that has meant for generally poorer workers in additional support and extra pension provision.</p>

Is that why the Government are building up the balance in the National Insurance Fund? Is this the real answer to the pensioners convention?</p>

<p><a name="08022663000037"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="08022663000060"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Not specifically. I was going to come on to the surplus in the national insurance fund, because we inevitably debate it at this time of year. The reality, and the answer to the National Pensioners Convention, which says that that surplus could be used dramatically to increase pensions now, is that the surplus is effectively invested back into other public services. If we spent that on increasing pensions immediately, one would have to raise taxation to deal with the other public services which the surplus currently supports. It is not available as a free amount, and is not otherwise allocated and invested in government services.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked whether we have the right strategy for child poverty. Six hundred thousand children have been lifted out of relative poverty already. The details announced in the previous Budget and the PBR on child benefit and child tax credit, and the issues that we have discussed in the child maintenance Bill, will support another 300,000 children in getting out of poverty, but there

We should not shy away from setting tough targets simply because they are tough.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000039"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones asked about statutory paternity pay and statutory adoption pay. We dealt with this on the then Work and Families Bill. I am struggling to remember which year it was&#151;I think it was 2006. I do not have a detailed breakdown of the information but I shall certainly write to my noble friend. Of course, we should recognise that these things are generally met by employers and not by government.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, again asked about the National Insurance Fund and said that he thought it covered a lot of things other than pensions. There is a tabulation showing total benefits for 2007-08 of something like &#163;65 billion, with a breakdown of the figures for retirement pensions, additional pensions, widows&#146; bereavement pensions, incapacity benefit and contribution-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, and there is also a schedule showing the totality of those payments.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022663000041"></a>The noble Lord also raised the question of pension take-up and the work that is being done in that respect. Given the time that we have spent on this order, perhaps I may send him a note, as I think that we have ranged over this matter before. Very extensive work is going on to ensure that people take up the benefits to which they are entitled. I hope that I have dealt with each of the questions raised. If noble Lords do not wish to challenge or raise any other points, I shall commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Human Rights. All the changes were announced in a Treasury press release published on 18 October 2007.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000004"></a>Since 1997, the Government have delivered a comprehensive programme of reforms to the tax and benefit system. Those reforms have simplified the system, tackled child and pensioner poverty and made work pay. The 2007 Budget announced the next stage in these reforms as part of a rebalancing of the tax and NIC systems to offer more support for work, families and pensioners. The package simplified income tax and NICs, increased the personal allowances for those aged 65 and over, and changed the rates and threshold for child tax credit and working tax credit. It means that from April 2009 there will be just two main rates of income tax, and they will apply to the same bands of income as the two rates of national insurance contributions, creating one of the simplest personal tax structures of any developed country.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000005"></a>To achieve this simplification, the package of measures announced in the Budget in 2007 included alignment of the upper earnings limit and upper profits limit with the level at which higher rate income tax is paid from April 2009. This is a two-stage process and the change in this order to the upper profits limit for the self-employed is part of the first stage.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000006"></a>I start with the small earnings exception for the self-employed, below which the self-employed may claim exemption from paying class 2 contributions. The exception will rise in April from &#163;4,635 to &#163;4,825 a year&#151;an increase broadly in line with prices. Many people choose to pay these contributions in order to protect their benefit entitlement. The rate of class 2 contributions for 2008-09 will rise from &#163;2.20 to &#163;2.30 a week&#151;again, an increase broadly in line with prices. </p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000007"></a>Staying with the self-employed, the draft order sets the profits limits between which main-rate class 4 contributions are paid. The lower limit, at which class 4 contributions become due, will increase broadly in line with inflation and the income tax personal allowance from &#163;5,225 to &#163;5,435 a year. At the other end of the scale, the upper profits limit will continue to match the upper earnings limit for employees, which will go up as part of the personal tax package to &#163;40,040 for the 2008-09 tax year. This ensures that the self-employed pay main-rate class 4 contributions on much the same range of earnings as employees liable to class 1 contributions and is an essential element in making the national insurance system fair for everyone. The draft order also deals with the weekly rate of voluntary class 3 contributions, which help those with insufficient contribution records in any given tax year to make up a qualifying year for benefit purposes. The rate of class 3 will rise in April by 30p to &#163;8.10 a week, a standard rerating in line with prices.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000008"></a>The review of contribution rates is accompanied by a report from the Government Actuary detailing the effects on the National Insurance Fund of the draft order and the draft order uprating benefits laid by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. I am pleased to say that there is no expectation that the fund will need a Treasury grant for the 2008-09 tax year.</p>

We have had a very good run, and the Minister has been very assiduous and helpful this afternoon. In earlier debates, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, acutely put his finger on some of the key contents of the Government Actuary&#146;s departmental report, and he was right to do so because we know that the established procedure is that the Government Actuary recommends that a minimum balance of one-sixth of the estimated annual benefit expenditure should be kept in the fund, and that it would not be safe to go below that because it would prejudice the potential future payment of benefits. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, rightly said, if we look at 2008-09, the estimated balance in the National Insurance Fund, to which this order contributes, is &#163;56,000,000,000; that is not one-sixth or 16.7 per cent of the estimated benefit expenditure, but 81.5 per cent. At what point does the Government Actuary ever get round to saying that there is more money in the fund than the Government know what to do with? If we look at appendix 9&#151;I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has it in front of him&#151;there is a forward projection about the balance at the end of the years 2008-09 to 2012-13. I accept that they are estimates and there will be lots of variables and assumptions in them, but the balance at the end of the year as a percentage of benefit payments goes from 81.5 per cent at the end of 2008-09 to 136.3 per cent of benefit expenditure.</p>

<p><a name="08022671000012"></a>We will need to wait until the Budget to see what fiscal drag is doing to whatever else is available to the Chancellor, because fiscal drag brings in more and more money in a surreptitious way by more people falling into higher rates of tax, year in, year out. However, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, in the context of an earlier order, is apposite, but perhaps not in terms of the National Pensioners Convention. I hope the Minister will take the trouble to go to the next convention. They are usually held in Blackpool and are very congenial events, but not for government Ministers. I have been and survived, but only just, and I am only a Liberal Democrat&#151;I am sounding slightly facetious. One would think that there is an embarras de richesse in the National Insurance Fund. Of course these are big numbers and things can happen, but what advice does the Government Actuary give? Does he not tap Ministers on the shoulder and say that it is getting a bit out of hand?</p>

Taken together with the fiscal drag that we will see in the Budget, it will be very difficult to understand when a Minister explains it at Blackpool. What serious discussions are taking place between the GAD, the Treasury and the DWP about how these provisions, which are accumulating in a way that is very difficult to describe to hard-pressed pensioner households, are going to be dealt with in future?</p>

I am not saying that it would be better if we had to be looking for Treasury grants. My noble friend, if I can call him that, and I were in the House of Commons at a time of big Treasury grants, not under this Administration but in times gone by. I do not want to get tempted into this issue because it is too late in the afternoon, but big Treasury grants were often required in the past to make this balance. This is a happy circumstance and I am grateful to Prudence, but she has some explaining to do at the National Pensioners Convention at Blackpool as well and the Minister had better take her with him when he goes.</p>

<p><a name="08022671000016"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022671000030"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am all for the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, putting flesh on my bones, but I hope he does not overdo it, because otherwise I shall have to go on a diet and stop thinking for a bit, which would probably be a good thing for the House but a bad thing for me.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000017"></a>The order is rather different in amount from the uprating order that we have just discussed. It is also different in scope. The House as a whole must surely believe, as I do, that Ministers in the department have behaved disgracefully. The Committee will remember that on the last Pensions Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, withdrew an amendment about allowing women, in particular, to buy extra years of class 3 contributions to augment their often lamentable state pensions on the basis of the promise that Ministers would find some way of achieving her aims, although not necessarily through buying more class 3 contributions. The noble Baroness asked an Oral Question on 17 December last about what progress the review was making. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, gave her the dismal answer that progress could not be made. He claimed that pensioners had been well served by the Government and pointed out that with the reduction in qualifying years from 44 to 30, by 2010 three-quarters of women would get their full state pension and 90 per cent would qualify by 2025. That is in col. 468 on 17 December 2007.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000018"></a>I have been pondering this a little and wonder whether the Minister could give us a little clarity. Will a woman retiring on 1 June 2011, in a little over three years from now, get the full state pension of &#163;90.70, at the 2008-09 rate, having paid only 30 years&#146; contributions? I have no idea exactly what the rate

A person retiring only one day before 5 April 2010 will need 44 years&#146; contributions, whereas, if the answer to my question is, as I expect, in the affirmative, he or she will have had to pay only 30 years&#146; contributions if they retire after that date. How many people are we talking about? What does 25 per cent or 90 per cent represent?</p>
<h5><a name="08022671000025"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000019"></a>When the order was debated in another place, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury said of uprating of the class 2 and 3 contributions, the small earnings exception and the lower profits limit:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022671000023"></a>&#147;All those increases are broadly in line with prices&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Eighth Delegated Legislation Committee, 20/2/08; col. 3.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022671000022"></a>&#147;Broadly in line&#148; is a very elastic term that I do not expect to hear from DWP Ministers. Inflation is 3.9 per cent&#151;or it was in October, when such things are fixed for the following year&#151;whereas, as my honourable friend Mr Gauke pointed out, class 2 contributions are to increase by 4.5 per cent. With the best will in the world, I cannot describe that as broadly in line. I realise that rounding must happen to the nearest 5p, but I do not understand how the increase from &#163;2.20 to &#163;2.30 was arrived at.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000020"></a>Another feature of the order is the very large increase in the upper earnings limit, from &#163;34,840 to &#163;40,000, which I calculate to be 19 per cent, as near as damn it. My suspicion is that, since the reason given is to align this figure with the 40 per cent income tax starting point, the Government are about to do something that has been resisted by all Governments since the inception of the National Insurance Fund: to combine NI contributions with tax, possibly even going so far as to do away with the UEL. Am I being too suspicious? There is certainly logic in my suspicion. It would harm the economy and infuriate business and the City. No doubt my noble friend Lady Noakes, who is expected to be fit enough to return to the House tomorrow, will pursue that when the National Insurance Contributions Bill hits us. As I understand it, the Minister will not be participating on that Bill, but I might well do so&#151;we shall see.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022671000021"></a>I have no more to add and I shall not, of course, object to the order.</p>

I shall start with the National Insurance Fund, which we touched on in our last debate. My noble friend Lord Jones is right. Where we are is a product of a successful economy, with many more people in employment and fewer people claiming unemployment benefit. Of course that will have an impact on the National Insurance Fund. The Government Actuary is independent. He is responsible for advising on whether the changes to social security are affordable.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000005"></a>The noble Lord encourages me to go to the National Pensioners Convention in Blackpool. I am pretty certain that I have a prior engagement, although I am not quite sure when it is. I did turn up  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to a regional event recently. We tucked into the sandwiches while they marched on the town hall. It was an interesting experience.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised the issue of class 3 contributions. The challenge we faced in trying to accommodate the thrust of the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Hollis was to see that it was appropriately targeted. At the tail end of the Pensions Bill last year we set out how we would do that, specifying clearly the criteria of fairness, affordability and simplicity. I made it clear in your Lordships&#146; House, and my honourable friend Mike O&#146;Brien made it clear in the other place, that there was no guarantee. We would use our best endeavours to achieve what my noble friend was seeking, but it could not be guaranteed. A lot of work was done in considering various options. At the end of the day, we come back to the issue of trying to ensure that something is properly targeted. That component is missing from this. It is potentially hugely expensive. It depends what assumptions you make about take-up, and we circulated some numbers in response to some Parliamentary Questions from my noble friend showing a range of costs and the range of people who might benefit.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000007"></a>The other issue is that, whichever way we analyse it, it is much more likely that the people who will take advantage of the extra buy-back will be those who are better able to afford it. It will do nothing to help people who have paid the reduced rate stamp, and it will do nothing to help people who are heading for pension credit&#151;the very poorest pensioners. It simply will not deliver what we want. It will help only a relatively small percentage of the number of people who might be retiring. The number of people reaching state pension age in 2008 will be something like 700,000. Some 390,000 will be women, and something like 250,000 will have less than a full basic state pension on their own record. My noble friend&#146;s proposal, at the level at which she suggested that there might be take-up, would at best cover only a fraction of the number of people who do not get a full basic state pension. I stress that, in our view, it is not well targeted.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000008"></a>My noble friend talked about the changes to the upper earnings level or upper profits level. Of course, that was part of an overall package. Given the hour, I will not go through all the components of it, but you cannot pick this out and say that it is an effective tax increase and ignore all the other things on which there was extra government spending. That package had a price tag of something like &#163;2.2 billion, so, overall, there was a relaxation of the fiscal system arising from that.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000009"></a>I look forward to welcoming the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, back to the House. I am sure that I will be participating in some quite fierce debates with her and that things will be as lively as ever on the National Insurance Contributions Bill. We will have the chance to get into these things in more details.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000010"></a>I will answer the specific question that the noble Lord raised. Somebody retiring on 1 June 2011 with 30 years&#146; contribution would get a full basic state pension; somebody retiring on 4 April 2010 with  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC141"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>30 years would not. It depends on their HRP&#151;home responsibilities protection&#151;which could reduce the number of years, so one cannot generalise. However, the number of qualifying years needed otherwise is 39 for a woman and 44 for a man. That is why the improvements that we made to the system last year will transform the pensions outcome for women. That is the right way to address what has been a long-standing grievance and an inequity in the system that has persisted for too long.</p>

That is readily understandable; in that case, the cost to the individual is, apparently, nil. On the other hand, there will be income into the fund when people buy the extra class 3 stamps&#151;for want of a better word. The Minister needs to explain the thinking more fully. I am sure that he will write in due course, and I do not want to pursue the matter at this hour of the night.</p>

<p><a name="08022673000012"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08022673000104"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I shall comment briefly but, if the noble Lord will forgive me, I shall not write as we shall pick up these matters in the National Insurance Contributions Bill, but if we do not, I shall write further.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000013"></a>If somebody pays class 3 contributions, that will add to the fund, but if we look at the long-tail effect of that in terms of the increased costs of pensions over a longer period, that will not compensate for that. The issue is that class 3 contributions are a really good deal. If we look at the full actuarial equivalent of a class 3 contribution&#151;at what the cost should be&#151;it is a multiple of four, or even six times, possibly even with the uprating. The noble Lord is right that for the individual going from 39 or 44 years to 30, there is no cost, but these things are dealt with collectively on a pay-as-you-go basis, so collectively there is a cost for fewer years&#146; contributions and the relinking with earnings. Having said that, in view of the hour, I ask the Committee to support the Motion.</p>

<h5><a name="08022673000099"></a>5.26 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08022673000015"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08022673000105"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Industrial Training Levy (Engineering Construction Industry Training Board) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000016"></a>The noble Baroness said: These orders seek authority for the Construction Industry Training Board and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board to impose a levy on employers in the industries they cover. I have a fairly lengthy speaking note, which I have tried to minimise, but I hope noble  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lords will bear with me as I go through some detail. Noble Lords will be interested to note that it is anticipated that these orders will be the last single-year orders to be brought before Parliament. As a consequence of amendments made to the Industrial Training Act 1982 by the Further Education and Training Act 2007, which are due to come into force on 2 March 2008, future levy orders are likely to be three years in duration.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000017"></a>The importance of skills cannot be overstated. Britain can succeed in a rapidly changing world only if we develop the skills of our people to the fullest possible extent, carry out world-class research and scholarship and apply both knowledge and skills to create an innovative and competitive economy. The creation in June last year of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills will drive forward delivery of the Government&#146;s long-term vision to make Britain one of the best places in the world for science, research and innovation and to deliver the ambition of a world-class skills base. However, despite the real progress we have made since 1997, we still have a lot of work to do before our nation&#146;s skills compare to those of our key competitor nations.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000018"></a>The Government have made,and continue to make, major investments in training. This year the Learning and Skills Council will fund further education and training to the value of more than &#163;8.5 billion, but while the Government have a role in setting the framework for success, employers need to be in the driving seat if we are to equip the workforce with the skills that employers need. Recognising the important contribution made by sector skills councils since 2002 and the potential for them to make an even greater impact, we have backed the call made by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, for sector skills councils to be reformed, relicensed and empowered. We have also backed his call for a new commission for employment and skills. It will begin its operations from 1 April. A key early task for the commission will be to manage the relicensing of the sector skills councils, making sure that every sector skills council is an authoritative and powerful advocate for skills in its sector.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000019"></a>In past manifestos we promised that where both sides of industry in a sector agree, we will help to set up a statutory framework for training. This commitment remains in place, and the recent order establishing the Film Industry Training Board for England and Wales, which came into effect last December, is an example of our continued commitment to this principle.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000020"></a>The two industrial training boards whose levy orders we are considering are models of the successful application of such frameworks. They are non-departmental public bodies set up under the Industrial Training Act 1982. Their role is to ensure that the quantity and quality of training are adequate to meet the needs of the industries they cover. They provide a wide range of services including setting occupational standards and developing vocational qualifications, delivering apprenticeships and paying direct grants to employers who carry out training to approved standards.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000021"></a>In fact the Construction Industry Training Board, in partnership with the Construction Industry Training Board Northern Ireland and the Construction Industry Council, operate as ConstructionSkills, the sector skills council for the construction industry. It developed one of the first sector skills agreements, which now underpins every facet of the Construction Industry Training Board&#146;s operations. Last year it maintained its position at the forefront of developments and launched an arm of the National Skills Academy on the site of the 2012 London Olympics, to address skills issues arising from this important project.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000022"></a>The Engineering Construction Industry Training Board is not a sector skills council. I am pleased to say, however, that it has worked closely with the Sector Skills Development Agency and will continue to work with the new Commission for Employment and Skills to scope out its future role within the Skills for Business Network.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000023"></a>The Industrial Training Act 1982contains provisions which enable levies to be raised on employers to finance an industry training board&#146;s activities and to share the cost of training more evenly between companies in an industry. It is for the employer members of a board to make proposals for the rate of levy for the industry it covers and for the Secretary of State to make an order giving effect to the proposals.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000024"></a>That is the purpose of the orders before us.Theygive effect to proposals submitted to us for a levy to be collected by the Construction Industry Training Board in 2008 and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board in 2009. The proposals from the Construction Industry Training Board and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board have the support of organisations representing more than half the employers who together are likely to pay the majority of the levy. The Secretary of State is satisfied that the levies are necessary to encourage adequate training in the industry.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000025"></a>The Act requires industry training boards to exclude small firms from the levy, but does not set a minimum size threshold. Each of these proposals sets a level that the industry considers to be appropriate. Employers who fall below the threshold are not however precluded from benefiting from grant and other support from the boards, and many of them do so.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000026"></a>In the orderbefore us the Construction Industry Training Board proposes that both its levy rates should stay the sameas those approved by the House last year. The rates will be 0.5 per cent of payroll for direct employees and 1.5 per cent of net expenditure on subcontract labour. Employers whose combined payroll and net expenditure on subcontract labour is less than &#163;76,000 will not have to pay the levy. This is an increase from last year&#146;s threshold of &#163;73,000 to reflect wage inflation. The level equates to an employer who employs three people full time throughout the year. 40 per cent of employers come into this category.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000027"></a>A further 25 per cent of employers will not be assessed for or will not pay the levy for other reasons; for example, they are in their first year of registration  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the Construction Industry Training Board or will have ceased trading. This means that around 65 per cent of employers will not actually be required to pay the levy.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000028"></a>The higher levy rate on subcontract labour is because, according to the industry, the vast majority of training is carried out by those employers with a directly employed labour force. Employers who opt to use subcontractor labour tend to have a transitory arrangement with their subcontractors and are not normally involved in their training.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000029"></a>It is encouraging to see that the large contractors, who use significant amounts of subcontract labour, are recognising their responsibility to contribute more than just cash to tackle the skill shortages in the industry. Through Construction Industry Training Board-ConstructionSkills&#146; programme-led apprenticeships initiative, large contractors have initiated action to encourage firms in their supply chains to recruit and train apprentices.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000030"></a>The Engineering Construction Industry Training Board also proposes to make no changes to last year&#146;s rates. The rates for sites will be 1.5 per cent of total payroll and net expenditure on subcontract labour. Contractors whose combined payroll and net expenditure on subcontract labour is &#163;275,000 or less will not have to pay the levy. The level is unchanged from last year and equates to an employer who employs 15 to 20 persons full time throughout the year. It is expected that 54 per cent of sites will be exempted. For head offices, it will be 0.18 per cent of the total of payroll and net expenditure on subcontract labour. Head offices whose combined payroll and net expenditure on subcontract labour is &#163;1 million or less will not have to pay the levy. This level is also unchanged from last year and equates to an employer who employs around 40 persons full time throughout the year. It is expected that 73 per cent of head offices will be exempted.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000031"></a>These proposals are expected to raise &#163;175 million to &#163;180 million for the Construction Industry Training Board and &#163;14 million to &#163;15 million for the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board, which covers a much smaller industry. It is worth pointing out that the CITB currently returns &#163;1.90 in direct and indirect training support for every &#163;1 levy received. For the ECITB the figure is &#163;2.11.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000032"></a>The Committee will know from our annual debates that the CITB and the ECITB exist because of the support they receive from employers and employer interest groups in their sectors. As I indicated earlier, there is a firm belief that without them there would be a serious deterioration in the quantity and quality of training in these industries, leading to a deficiency in skill levels. This was confirmed by reviews of both boards carried out by my department in 2003, which found that the principle of the levy is still strongly supported in each industry. The boards&#146; own annual employer surveys also demonstrate continued strong support for the principle of a levy system.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000033"></a>The industry training boards&#146; successes have not occurred without the significant efforts of the many people working for them. In particular, I pay tribute to the leadership of the two boards. For the ECITB,  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Terry Lazenby and David Edwards have continued to spearhead the industry&#146;s drive to meet the challenge facing it. The same is true of Sir Michael Latham and Peter Lobban, who will retire in August from the CITB. I thank them all and wish Peter Lobban a long and happy retirement.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000034"></a>The draft orders will enable the two boards to carry out their vital training responsibilities in 2008, and I believe it is right that the House should approve them. I beg to move.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80226-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000035"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Industrial Training Levy (Engineering Construction Industry Training Board) Order 2008. <I>7th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I><I>.&#151;</I>(<I>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="08022673000036"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022673000106"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> This has become an annual ritual. For about eight years I have welcomed these orders for these two training boards because we believe that the concept of the levy grant was a good one that has resulted in very considerable benefits to the two industries. It is slightly amusing that the Minister indicated that the Government were currently pleased with the how the scheme was working and that it had been extended to the film industry in December 2007&#151;and that industry voted in favour of having a levy grant system.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000037"></a>There is a slightly plaintive paragraph in the impact assessments. Paragraph 9 in both reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022673000096"></a>&#147;Ministers have acknowledged that to insist on non-statutory arrangements is unrealistic and have agreed to retain a statutory ITB subject to regular review&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022673000093"></a>I think that there may be a touch of the Leitch agenda in the slight change in mood, which is not reflected in the impact assessment. Nevertheless, the system has worked very well. For the CITB, the Minister quoted a figure of &#163;1.90 for every &#163;1 invested, and for the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board, she quoted &#163;2.11, whereas the impact assessment quotes &#163;2.22&#151;a slight increase on her figure, although I am not sure that it really matters.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000038"></a>There is some indication of the mountain that we have to climb in terms of skills. I note from the impact assessment that there are in the region of 75,000 to 80,000 employers in the construction industry, yet only 16,000 employers have apprentices. Of those 16,000, 14,600 are small and medium-sized businesses and probably have one or two apprentices at most. Therefore, we have to climb a huge mountain if we are to approach the aspiration of world-class skills held by the Government and the noble Lord, Lord Leitch. </p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000039"></a>As I said, we very much welcome the orders. As the Minister indicated, it is interesting to see the degree to which the Construction Industry Training Board is now running construction skills. I have had quite a lot to do with some of its programmes and I very much welcome what it is doing with the various programmes that it is getting up and running.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000040"></a>I have three questions for the Minister, although they may overlap. How do these training arrangements fit into Train to Gain? Do the two industries have to pay twice? They have to pay by levy for training  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC146"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schemes, yet if they were not paying by levy, Train to Gain would give them a lot of money to train their employees. Will we now see some of these firms being reluctant to participate in the levy grant system because they will be receiving the money from Train to Gain? My other question concerns apprenticeship arrangements. How far do the Government&#146;s new plans for apprenticeships overlap with the arrangements that are already in place under the industry training board? The Government are introducing a number of inducements to employers to take up apprentices. Again, is there an overlap? Will this industry, which is paying the levy grant system, pay twice?</p>

<p><a name="08022673000041"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022673000107"></a>Lord Jones:</b> The Minister always presents her speeches persuasively and I, for one, thank her for her presentation. During a long parliamentary life, it has become clear to me that all is not well in the training industry, if you can call it that. It appears that every five or six years each Administration sets out reform measures, but we never seem to hit the target. Therefore, I wished the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, well, and I certainly welcome these orders. I wish only to ask a few questions.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000042"></a>Can the Minister indicate how many employers are levied in our country? Do we know how many employees might be grouped under the heading of &#147;engineering&#148; when at work? How large in employer terms is the engineering industry? It is certainly one of our most vital remaining industries in Britain.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000043"></a>Do we have any idea how well the engineering construction board is progressing? Is its efficiency assessed? By whom? Who is taking the temperature? Who is watching and assessing the board? My guess is that it is rather a good board. Our last great employer of skilled employees in Britain is the aerospace industry. There are tens of thousands of employees in that great manufacturing industry. How well does the board serve the needs of our great aerospace industry?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000044"></a>My noble friend mentioned apprenticeships, and we both know that that is the future for what remains of British manufacturing. We know that the orders are vital to the future of British manufacturing. How many aerospace apprentices are training under the aegis of the engineering board? It would be helpful to know that. Also, is it possible to know how many apprentices are training under the aegis of the Construction Industry Training Board?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000045"></a>I know that my noble friend is a busy and conscientious Minister, so it is just possible that she has not read the obituary column in the <I>Independent</I> today. If she has not, why not? After successfully coping with these orders, my noble friend might want to read the obituary of Sir Maurice Laing. The sub-heading reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022673000097"></a>&#147;Firebrand head of the Laing construction company who became the first president of the CBI&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022673000094"></a>The article is mildly revelatory and may help the Minister with future orders.</p>

<p><a name="08022673000046"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022673000108"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the orders. My notes, in contrast to hers, are very short. I agree with the Minister that, for us to be a world-class, competitive economy, the skills base  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC147"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the UK must improve dramatically. As always, the noble Baroness speaking for the Liberal Democrats has made many of the remarks that I was going to make, so that shortens my contribution even more, but I want to re-emphasise some of the points that have been made.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000047"></a>Both in construction and in engineering some exemplary training can be found, particularly at level 3 apprenticeships. While there is some sense in consulting more widely among employers, it may become a disincentive for some employers to join the representative organisations that sign up to the pledge of training, which in turn may mean that it is harder to measure how much support there really is for employers wishing to join representative organisations. Can the Minister say what impact the Further Education and Training Act 2007 will have on the way in which the industrial training boards consult to establish consent for future levies?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000048"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, mentioned an explanatory memorandum covering the film industry, stating that an order to establish an ITB covering the sector came into force on 7 December 2007. That arose from work undertaken by the sector skills council in that industry. I would be interested to hear from the Minister about the lessons that can be learnt from that success in building consent for a new voluntary training levy. Are other sectors to follow? Can the Minister shed light on the successes that the film industry has had so far? Can the Minister clarify the impact that the Further Education and Training Act 2007 will have on the way in which the industrial training boards consult to establish consent for future levies? Will the extension of training levies be considered when the Government review the impact of the skills pledge in 2010?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000049"></a>Can the Minister expand on the Government&#146;s plan to concentrate more strongly on level 3 skills? Will the focus remain on level 2 skills? Finally, can the Minister say at what point employers are exempt from having to sign up to the skills pledge? I know that the Minister elaborated on that, but it is still slightly unclear to me.</p>

<p><a name="08022673000050"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08022673000109"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I thank noble  Lords for taking part in this short but important debate and for the support for the orders that resonates around the Committee. We can all see the valuable work that the training levies allow. I have been asked a lot of specific questions. If I do not pick them all up, I will write to noble Lords in detail and read <I>Hansard</I> to ensure that we have covered all the questions.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000051"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked whether the employers levied are paying twice. It might be helpful to say that both boards are in discussion with the department about how they can benefit from Train to Gain. They will not have to pay twice. It is important to get that on the record. The noble Baroness rightly picked up not a change of tone but a very vigorous commitment to promote employer-led training through the experience of the Leitch review and Train to Gain. This applies to the next order as well. Being new to the department, I assure her that  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we highly value the work of the training boards and the levies. I will definitely have to write to her about &#163;2.22 versus &#163;2.11. That needs to be put right on the record.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000052"></a>I shall try to deal with some of the questions that my noble friend has levied, if I can make that pun. He asked about the engineering industry, particularly apprenticeships in the aerospace industry. In the engineering construction industry there were 1,400-plus apprentices in training in 2006 and 200 completions. I shall have to get back to him on aerospace. In the construction industry there are around 30,000 apprenticeships in training. The largest groups are in bricklaying, carpentry and joinery, painting and decorating, bench joinery and solid plastering.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000053"></a>My noble friend asked who assesses the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board. That is an important question. He has a way of putting his finger on the key issues. The boards are brought to account through their annual report to their industries, which is also laid before Parliament. The employers signify satisfaction by their agreement to support the levy proposals through the consultation process that has to go on.</p>

<p><a name="08022673000054"></a>The Engineering Construction Industry Training Board is concerned with the erection, maintenance and dismantling of process plants, oil installations and power stations. It is not relevant to the aerospace industry. It has 60,000 people working in the sector and there are 1,400 apprentices in training.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000055"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked a very important question about the Further Education and Training Act. The changes in that Act are not aimed at weakening the role of the federations of employers. They are intended to bring the Act in line with the employment landscape for the 21st century. Although employers are not necessarily signing up to the federations in the numbers that they did in the past, the federations will still have a central role, but it is important to allow the industrial training boards to operate a levy in the way that best suits the industry. They will have to use other ways of involving employers that are not in federations. The changes to the Industrial Training Act have been made at the request of the industrial training boards on behalf of the employers and their industries. We are very much working with employers, aiming to be employer-led and maintaining strong consultation and communication between employers.</p>

<p><a name="08022673000056"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022673000110"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> Will the Minister clarify the situation? I think I am right in saying that, as a result of the Further Education and Training Act, the only difference is that the boards do not have to come to Parliament every year to ask it to renew the order, as we have been doing today. This is therefore the last occasion that we shall be doing this. Equally, the concept of the industrial training board remains. I take it that the statutory framework, which stems from 1981-82, remains the same&#151;that is, where an industry voluntarily requires a training board, it may have one, as has happened with the film industry. In the background, with Leitch, there is also a slight indication that post-2010, if companies do not come up with the training pledge, there may be some other form of statutory encouragement to training.</p>

There are two differences in the Act. We have talked about the three-year change. Perhaps I was being obscure or opaque, but because the number of employers joining federations, which is the traditional method of consultation, is going down, there is a need to create an additional method of consultation to ensure that training levies are acceptable to and supported by employers. That is a small but important change in addition to the three-year change.</p>

<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>4 February.This debate provides an opportunity to discuss the draft Regional Learning and Skills Councils Regulations 2007 and completes the parliamentary reform process set in train by the passage of the Further Education and Training Act 2007.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000067"></a>The Act contains provision relating to the restructuring of the Learning and Skills Council. Section 2 inserts a provision into the Learning and Skills Act 2000 requiring the Learning and Skills Council to establish regional learning and skills councils for each area of England specified by the Secretary of State. These will replace the 47 local councils which have been abolished under Section 3 of the 2007 Act. By &#147;local councils&#148;, I do not mean local authorities. When I first read my brief, I thought, &#147;That doesn&#146;t quite sound right&#148;.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000068"></a>The draft regulations make provision about regional councils of the Learning and Skills Council for England, including matters such as membership, the appointment of members, the delegation of regional council functions, and regional council proceedings. They are the first set of regulations to be made using the power in Section 18A(2) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 as inserted by Section 2 of the 2007 Act.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000069"></a>The case for change was already made during the passage of the Act&#151;I know that noble Lords were very much involved with that. Since its creation in 2001, the Learning and Skills Council has found it increasingly necessary to operate at a regional level and within a regional context. In response to this, the LSC has already set up nine regional offices as part of its executive structure, supported by informal regional committees, which were established under paragraph 1(1)(b) of Schedule 3 to the Learning and Skills Act 2000.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000070"></a>Today&#146;s draft regulations make provision about regional councils as a statutory part of the LSC&#146;s structure, with boundaries that will match the geographic areas of the nine government office regions. The proposals form one strand of an overall package of measures to streamline the LSC&#146;s accountability structure. They aim to bring consistency between the non-executive structure and the new internal staffing structure that the LSC has now put in place, while bringing savings of &#163;40 million, which will be redirected to front-line services.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000071"></a>These changes to the LSC&#146;s executive and non-executive structures will strengthen its capacity to commission, with partners, the learning and skills infrastructure needed across the regions and meet our aspirations to improve the skills of the population to ensure a world-class skills base by 2020.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000072"></a>We are continuing with these plans in the light of the recent machinery of government announcement on 16-19 funding, and the Education and Skills Bill which is passing through Parliament in another place. The decision to transfer 16-19 funding to local authorities has signalled a major change for the LSC. These changes will take time to implement and the LSC will remain responsible for funding all forms of post-16 education and training outside higher education for some time.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000073"></a>We will look for the LSC to build on its achievements, and to play a key role in ensuring that a wide range of skills provision is available to support business needs.To do this, it must have a strong and robust accountability structure in place which enables the LSC to work effectively with partners at all levels to ensure that the system continues to deliver on the new and challenging targets which we have set.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000074"></a>During the past few months, we have also published the LSC grant letter, setting out our priorities for the next three years, which will require a strong executive and non-executive LSC structure to maintain delivery. The grant letter made it clear that the LSC needs to operate strongly at national, regional and local level to achieve government's objectives. For example, the grant letter identifies delivering an expanded train-to-gain service through closer working with regional development agencies as one of the LSC&#146;s top priorities.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000075"></a>These draft regulations also need to be set in the context of the review of sub-national economic growth that was published last year. It recognised that regions and localities need to play a vital part in ensuring that they can continue to benefit from economic growth. These regulations are necessary to fulfil the policies that underpin the restructuring of the LSC and make provision for the establishment of the operation of regional councils. I commend them to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

It is clear that a world-class skills base by 2020 is a most necessary objective for Britain with regard to keeping what is left of, for example, her manufacturing base. It is good to know that the councils have been given leadership in the form of setting out a strategy for the years immediately ahead. Can my noble friend indicate the salary that will be paid to council chairmen? Salaries might vary, but what sort of salary and how many days, if such it shall be? Are any female chairmen yet in post? What might a member of a council be paid? Could the Minister expound on the interface between the colleges of further education and these councils? Is there any likelihood that the relationships will be good?</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Jones, may be interested to know that they will be backed up by 150 local partnerships in which FE colleges will undoubtedly play some part. The Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies the regulations explains that the immediate costs will be about

I hope that, in time, the Government may put a little more than that into adult apprenticeships because they will need a lot more money than that.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000079"></a>I have three questions. One is trivial and perhaps shows my ignorance of the way these regulations are drafted. The Council with a capital C that is referred in the regulations is, I take it, the national Learning and Skills Council, but there is nothing in the regulations that spells that out. We normally get a little paragraph that tells us that the &#147;Council&#148; is the Learning and Skills Council. Perhaps it is unnecessary because it is spelt out in the Act, but I take it that it is the &#147;Council&#148; mentioned here.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000080"></a>My second point is more substantive. The old local learning and skills councils had 750 non-executive members. They spanned business, local authorities, further and higher education institutions, trade unions, voluntary bodies and other local interests. These regulations do not specify any requirements for representation or membership. Members are to be appointed by the national Learning and Skills Council and approved by the Secretary of State, and the chairman is to be appointed by the Secretary of State. Will nothing spell out that these councils must be reasonably representative of different bodies within the region? It would seem appropriate for people from business, local authorities, the further and higher education sector, trade unions and the various voluntary bodies to be represented on these regional councils. Will there be further regulations or will guidance be issued? Will anything further be done? There is a danger that the whole thing could become a self-perpetuating oligarchy, with all our friends being reappointed in these positions. How do we stop that happening?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000081"></a>Finally, the Minister talked about the need for strong and robust accountability. The only accountability for these regional learning and skills councils is through the Secretary of State. There is no accountability at a regional level to any elected, democratic authority lower than through Parliament. It is right that we have accountability through Parliament but it is a somewhat protracted, indirect accountability. Talking about strong, robust accountability is nice but I think that it is a bit pie in the sky.</p>

<p><a name="08022673000082"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08022673000118"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> Once again, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations. We all agree that we must have a world-class skills base. As before, the noble Lord, Lord Jones, has asked a number of the questions that I had intended to put, so I shall re-emphasise, and elaborate on, their importance.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000083"></a>The regulations make provision for the salaries of the chairman and other members of regional councils. Can the Minister confirm that each of the nine regional directors will be paid salaries of between &#163;115,000 and &#163;140,000? That means that, even on a generous estimate, the wage bill will be in excess of &#163;1 million, but of course that does not take

Will the Minister also shed light on the average total wage bill for each regional committee?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000084"></a>If the restructuring of the learning and skills councils means that they are designed to be more responsive to employer, business and local demands, what specific interface will the new bodies have in terms of the constitution of the new bodies? What are the structural relationships?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000085"></a>The regulations enable each regulatory council to appoint,</p>
<ul><a name="08022673000098"></a>&#147;such of its employees as it thinks fit to act as the staff of a regional council&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022673000095"></a>Perhaps the Minister can elaborate on what &#147;fit to act&#148; means. Can she say how many employees, both full-time and part-time, are currently working for the regional councils? Can she also say what roles the sector skills councils will have? There is no mention of them in these regulations. Finally, can the Minister say whether the national apprenticeship service will have a relationship with these new bodies?</p>

<p><a name="08022673000086"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08022673000119"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> Once again, I thank noble Lords for taking part in this important discussion and for their warm welcome for these regulations. I think that I speak on behalf of the Government if I say that sometimes the Government feel that the accountability is pretty far-reaching, probing and challenging. However, it is extremely important, and I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, concurs with that. Clearly, the questions that have been asked are not trivial, and I am very happy to deal with them as comprehensively as I can. </p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000087"></a>My noble friend asked a question about payment, and I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, was also looking for the answer on that. The average wage bill for a regional council is expected to be in the region of &#163;252,000 per annum. That includes a regional director at &#163;125,000, a regional chair&#151;obviously part-time&#151;at &#163;23,000, and 14 regional council members at a total cost of &#163;104,000, but an individual cost of &#163;7,400.</p>
<h5><a name="08022673000101"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000088"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked how the membership of the council will be set out. I believe that my noble friend Lord Adonis in Grand Committee on 22 January set out for the record that each regional council will be business-led, drawing employers from priority skill sectors in the region concerned. We expect membership to include a further education college principal and one other provider of work-based learning, a voluntary/community sector provider or school. All regional councils are expected to include a representative of the regional development agency, a trade union member and a member of a local authority. He also said that the Minister had written to Chris Banks, from the Learning and Skills Council, setting out his expectation that each regional council will also include a learner. We expect one or more members to be able to bring a good understanding of higher education, and there should be two observer members, one from Jobcentre Plus and one from the Government. I am happy to repeat that now.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000089"></a>I have picked up the question of salaries. My noble friend Lord Jones asked about further education colleges and councils. As I have said, they will be represented on the regional council. The noble Baroness Lady Sharp asked why the definition of council is not in the Act. Apparently it is not good drafting practice to include an unnecessary definition. That was her &#147;trivial&#148; question, but I have to say that it is quite an interesting question which I will look at further.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000090"></a>I picked up on the cost of regional councils. I am happy to review this discussion and ensure I have answered all noble Lords&#146; questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, had a further question about the role of the sector skills councils. My noble friend Lord Adonis said in Committee that we want to emphasise the importance of working closely with the sector skills council. It is good that she has given me the opportunity to reiterate this. They play an increasingly important role in capturing and articulating employer demand for investment in skills. This role was also stressed by my noble friend Lord Leitch in his report, as everyone is well aware. Central to our ambition for sector skills councils is engaging with employers in their sector to stimulate increased demand for investment in skills.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022673000091"></a>With that and a commitment&#151;</p>

The point of having regional councils is to allow them to engage more strategically. The noble Baroness has picked up one of the most important points, which is to allow the regional councils to engage directly with the national apprenticeship service and to be strongly involved as the service develops and rolls out. They will also be involved in regional development authorities. There needs to be a lot of joining up with RDAs, the national apprenticeship service and sector skills councils. There is an enormous challenge, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, stressed. She also kindly answered the point about the 150 local partnership groups. We are talking about operating at a regional level but maintaining very strong partnerships locally, particularly with small to medium-sized employers.</p>

<p><a name="08022680000004"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08022680000061"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I have one more question for the Minister. Paragraph 3 is about the tenure for members. The chairman can be reappointed. The paragraph says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022680000052"></a>&#147;On ceasing to be a member or chairman a person is eligible for re-appointment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022680000049"></a>Is there a standard length of appointment? It is not written in the regulations. Is there any restriction on the chairman being reappointed indefinitely on every occasion?</p>

They are part of a package of measures that will put into place new procedures for parking enforcement by local authorities in Wales. They were laid before the House on 7 January and debated in the Commons on 5 February 2008. Similar regulations for England were brought before the House on 19 November 2007.

The only material differences relate to the fact that approval for new civil parking contraventions systems&#151;CPE&#151;will be given by the Welsh Assembly Government in Wales, which will also issue statutory and non-statutory guidance to local authorities in Wales. This means that motorists should have no reason to be confused by separate parking enforcement systems when travelling between Wales and England, or even between different local authorities within Wales. Local authorities will also be able to compare their performance against similar local authorities to see whether their own systems require revision.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000010"></a>I am sure that noble Lords are well aware of the importance of good traffic management in improving road safety, reducing congestion and minimising the impact of road traffic on the environment. The Traffic Management Act 2004 gives local authorities a specific duty to manage their networks, and fair and effective parking enforcement has a role to play in that. The regulations will help them to do that in a fair, transparent and effective manner, with the overarching objective of keeping traffic moving safely. There will also be the benefit of making public transport more attractive to passengers.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000011"></a>Essentially, the regulations tidy up and strengthen legislation that stems from the Road Traffic Act 1991. The new enforcement system will also benefit motorists by encouraging the best use of available road space and provide a more transparent mechanism for enforcement. Ministers of the Welsh Assembly Government will be responsible for considering local authorities&#146; new proposals for CPE and deciding whether they should be approved.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000012"></a>There may be instances where a vehicle has been immobilised or removed in error, or where a penalty charge notice has been served in error, for example, because a driver might be delivering or collecting  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>goods while displaying a valid permit or because the owner who receives a payment reminder was not the owner at the time of the contravention. That is why the regulations also provide for measures to challenge the action of local authorities and to appeal to an adjudication service should those challenges be rejected. For example, the adjudicator will have the power to return a case to the local authority to reconsider a contravention that took place in mitigating circumstances.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000013"></a>The procedures for representations and appeals largely replicate those in the 1991 Act. The regulations maintain the 1991 Act&#146;s simplified and streamlined process in which appeals will continue to be made to an independent adjudication service that deals only with parking issues. Local authorities are required to publicise those mechanisms so that they are easily accessible to the public.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000014"></a>The package of regulations&#151;others are being taken through the legislative processes of the National Assembly for Wales&#151;has been finalised following a widespread consultation exercise. Responses were received from individual local authorities in Wales, the police, the British Parking Association, the Institute of Highways and Transport, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport and others. In addition, the package of regulations has also benefited from expert and robust advice from the entirely independent adjudicators.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000015"></a>These proposals were first brought to the attention of local authorities in January 2007 as part of an initial consultation. It was clear even then that local authorities wishing to take on these permissive powers would need time to review their parking strategy, confirm that CPE is required, employ and train civil enforcement officers, update their ICT systems and ensure that road markings and signs are correct.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000016"></a>Subject to parliamentary and National Assembly for Wales procedures, and given the preparations that local authorities need to make, the coming into force date for these powers is 31 March this year. It is also important to note that local authorities that choose to take on these powers should aim to achieve self-financing as quickly as possible, utilising income from parking charges and PCNs to cover the cost of CPE. CPE is not a revenue-raising measure, and any surplus will have to be used on transport-related schemes. The Welsh Assembly Government will receive annual reports from local authorities that adopt CPE detailing their CPE activities and how any surplus was spent.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000017"></a>The regulations have been widely welcomed by local authorities and the public and I hope that they will be welcomed by all Members of the Committee, who I know have a great interest in promoting the best and safest use of road space and encouraging public transport. It has taken a great deal of hard work to balance the need of local authorities for a strong and effective enforcement regime with a system that motorists will recognise as flexible and fair. The Welsh Assembly Government will be issuing detailed operational guidance, statutory guidance and guidance about the use of approved devices used to record alleged contraventions to help local authorities that wish to take on CPE. I beg to move.</p>

We have no serious quarrels with it, and we welcome it. I note her comment to me about tax-raising instruments. I totally accept that this is not a tax-raising power. We have had discussions about that on other occasions in this Room. I have a few questions and a simple request. The Minister mentioned a package of regulations and powers, but it is really more than that. The complexity of legislation in Wales coming from Westminster needs some serious government attention. I ask the Minister to pass that on. I refer noble Lords to <I>Hansard</I> in the other place, on Tuesday 5 February in col. 8, where my honourable friend Cheryl Gillan laid out that complexity very clearly. That is well worth reading for those who are going to have a go at simplifying how regulations are interpreted for Wales, because about 10 different bits of procedure have to be gone through in four Houses&#151;here, the other place, Europe and the Assembly&#151;just for some parking regulations. That cannot be sensible for something so simple.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000020"></a>Only six local authorities have decriminalised out, I think, of 22&#151;I cannot remember how many there are. As I understand this, local authorities that have not decriminalised cannot benefit from this legislation and those things that flow from it. Passing legislation that will be used by only some very small percentage of Wales is not a good idea. Do Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the Minister have any idea how they will either persuade or help Welsh local authorities to decriminalise? I do not know whether it is funding or the amount of administration that is required or what is needed to help, but that needs to be done as swiftly as possible.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000021"></a>In relation to cross-border happenings and now that this legislation is in place throughout the kingdom, including Scotland and Northern Ireland, will there now be a level playing field? Can motorists expect the same treatment all over the United Kingdom for parking offences and in particular for appeals against parking offences? There are offences that arise and people will be charged and fined, and so on. It would be nice to know about that, and this is a wonderful opportunity. I think that I understood the Minister to say that that is the case, but I should like confirmation that as a result of the legislation we will now have a fair, even and level playing field for parking management, fines and appeals against those fines. If that is the case, it is very much to be welcomed.</p>

Whatever, they are surely to be welcomed. Mundane though parking matters may be, as the Explanatory Memorandum shows these regulations are yet another step down the devolutionary road. The Welsh Assembly and the Mother of Parliaments are now gingerly exploring the limitations and potential of their relationship, which is but eight years old in a nation that was recognisable from at least 400 or 500 AD.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000023"></a>At paragraph 7.4 in the Explanatory Memorandum, regarding the responses to the documents, of which there were 16 in total, was there a theme and did the Welsh Local Government Association make a response? One assumes that it did, because it gives a strong lead to Wales&#146;s local authorities. It is not an exaggeration to say that the Welsh Local Government Association has growing influence in the post-devolution scene. It has a lot to give and a lot to lead on. Can my noble friend say which local authorities in Wales responded to the consultation?</p>
<h5><a name="08022680000057"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08022680000024"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08022680000066"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> Many of the points that I wished to make have been covered, but I feel that it is a promising movement in the right direction for Wales to have the regulations. It is interesting from a constitutional point of view that the regulations cover non-devolved matters that are in the process of being transferred to the Assembly. I welcome that; it is a very slow process, as the noble Lord, Lord Jones, has just said. The enforcement authorities and the representations that will be made to them are a welcome step, as is the fact that there is to be an independent adjudicator. The regulations set out the grounds for making representations and for appeals.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000025"></a>I want to make a few points about some things in the Explanatory Memorandum. In paragraph 2.4, there is mention of civil enforcement officers acting on behalf of local authorities. First, I have a rhetorical question: do the enforcement officers already exist? I believe that they do and that they are employed by local authorities. The regulations open the door to others&#151;agencies or private contract companies&#151;and I am sure that those of us who live in Wales and are well acquainted with it know the situation in Cardiff, for example, where some parking has, after 10 or 12 years, become extremely expensive. Presumably, the penalties will likewise become even more expensive. It is a live issue in Cardiff, and this change may add fuel to the fire. What will the level of penalty charges be? Will they be self-financing from the point of view of employing enforcement officers? I gather from the document that, in fact, there will be no additional charges, but it seems to me that there may be.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000026"></a>Some other points emerge from the description in paragraph 4.6 of the Explanatory Memorandum. Local authorities will perhaps already have the staff, the equipment and the action plans, but will they all be ready by 31 March? There is some doubt about that, and some provision is made for it. However, it might be a slow process. When does the Minister think that it will all be in place?</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000027"></a>In paragraph 5.1, there is mention of minor differences of detail between the administration arrangements in England and those in Wales. Can the Minister say what those might be? There are questions arising from that.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000028"></a>The other point that I might make is that paragraph 7.7 of the Explanatory Memorandum refers to a reduction from 60 to 30 minutes after the PCN is issued before a vehicle is clamped. I assume that the same applies in England. That does not seem to be very long and it could cause grave inconvenience and unnecessary bureaucracy in the process. What is the Minister&#146;s view on that?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000029"></a>Paragraph 8.1, which concerns the impact of the regulations, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08022680000053"></a>&#147;No significant financial implications have been identified for members of the public or the public sector&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08022680000050"></a>That is a very broad statement and I am not totally convinced that local authorities will not have to find more resources. Certainly the one that I live in has received only a 2 per cent increase in funding this year, which is less than inflation. In fact, some of these matters do not add up as they should.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000030"></a>The other point that I want to make concerns the regulatory impact assessment, in which there is a very worthy statement. It refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="08022680000054"></a>&#147;restraining the growth in the use of the private car&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08022680000051"></a>That is very desirable but in much of rural Wales&#151;which is most of Wales&#151;there is very poor public transport and the car is the only means of getting about. I hope that that will be taken into account in all these regulations. Not so long ago, it used to be said that there was only one set of traffic lights in mid-Wales. Now there are a few more but there are not some of the traffic-management facilities that are mentioned in these documents. Quite frankly, this will be regarded by some citizens in rural Wales as &#147;outer space&#148; legislation.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000031"></a>I take the point that obviously not everyone will opt into this system, but the risk assessment makes a number of points on the costs and benefits of the regulations. Those may be a little out of the question in, for example, some market towns in central Wales, where there are often plenty of parking spaces and a very sparse population.</p>

<p><a name="08022680000032"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08022680000067"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I thank noble Lords for joining me in the discussion on these regulations. I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, who said that parking should be simple. I am not sure about that. In local politics, parking schemes probably engender some of the most hotly contested campaigns&#151;certainly in my experience.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000033"></a>I shall aim to deal with some of the questions as helpfully as I can. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, raised his now perhaps well documented concerns about the process of legislation-making following the Government of Wales Act. I shall not bore everyone with my now well documented support of the process. I happen to believe that devolution is a great thing, and we are doing our very best in government to make it a success. I shall leave it at that, but I understand the noble Lord&#146;s view and I am very happy to discuss it further whenever the opportunity arises.</p>

<h5><a name="08022680000058"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

I am delighted to hear it. He asked how many local authorities are taking up decriminalisation of parking enforcement. According to my advice, seven local authorities operate DPE in Wales. Local authorities with DPE will become CPE authorities on 31 March. Local authorities without DPE will need to apply to the Welsh Assembly Government to become CPE. The noble Lord asked what measures will encourage local authorities to do that. Successful implementation by the seven will encourage them, with other local authorities seeing a benefit to their communities. It is up to the local authorities to come to the Welsh Assembly Government if they so wish.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000036"></a>The noble Lord asked also about cross-border level playing fields. My experience in Cardigan was that playing fields are not always very level&#151;there are very different gradients. As the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, identified, there is a level playing field between Wales and England, though obviously not with regard to rugby at the moment. An important point was made about the joint appeals committee for England and Wales. Such a committee is very important.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, asked about the level of charges. There will be two levels of charging, depending on the seriousness of the contravention: &#163;40 plus &#163;60, or &#163;50 plus &#163;70. I hope that that helps answer the noble Lord&#146;s question.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000038"></a>The noble Lord asked whether the Government felt that local authorities would be ready. This is obviously a matter for local authorities. They have known about these proposals since January 2007, because time for them to train staff and to ensure that road signs and markings are correct and ready for any changeover was needed. The noble Lord asked also about a reduction in clamping time from 60 to 30 minutes. I am advised that this was changed following wide public consultation.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000039"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones asked about local authorities and who responded. I am afraid that I do not have sight of that information, so I shall follow up the matter with him.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, asked about rural Wales. I share his frustration about the difficulties of travelling in rural Wales, but I stress that this is very much about local authorities serving their local communities as best they see fit. I hope that any changes in regulations will be proportionate. I hope that noble Lords will support the regulations.</p>

<h5><a name="08022680000059"></a>6.49 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08022680000042"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08022680000070"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it  has considered the Charities Act 2006 (Charitable Companies Audit and Group Accounts Provisions) Order 2008.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000043"></a>The noble Lord said: The order represents the culmination of a process that started during the passages of the Charities Bill and Companies Bill through your Lordships&#146; House during 2005 and 2006. It is a rather technical order&#151;I make no apologies for that because it needs to be&#151;and the process is also somewhat technical. I shall take us through the explanation as carefully as I can so that the Committee can understand the order better.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000044"></a>The object is to provide more a straightforward scrutiny regime for smaller charities. While saying that, I would like to record my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, because during the passage of the Charities Bill through this House not once but twice&#151;some 70 hours of scrutiny&#151;he played a blinder and made an important contribution to ensuring that this order came about. During the passage of the Charities Bill and Companies Bill in 2005 the noble Lord proposed amendments to both Bills to bring about the alignment of the accounts scrutiny requirements for charities that are companies, which are currently scrutinised under company law, and those of non-company charities, which are currently scrutinised as a matter of charity law. We were receptive to the idea and sought the views of charity sector umbrella groups and relevant professional bodies, who also warmly welcomed the proposal, and amendments were made to both Bills.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000045"></a>The order sets out to achieve two main changes. The first change that the order will make is to amend the Charities Act 1993 to apply the charity law accounts scrutiny provisions in place of the existing company law reporting accountant and audit requirements that apply to small charitable companies. This will ensure that charities in company form that are below the company law audit threshold will become subject to the same accounts scrutiny requirements under charity law as non-company charities, creating the level playing field that has long been called for by the sector and its professional advisers.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000046"></a>Changes were made to the Companies Bill, in what are now Section 1175 of and Schedule 9 to the Companies Act 2006. They remove the current company law accounts scrutiny requirements that apply to charitable companies below the audit threshold. The Charities Bill was amended, in what is now Section 77 of the Charities Act 2006, to provide an order-making power to deal with the necessary changes required to be made to charity law following the removal of small charitable companies from the company law accounts scrutiny regime. The order we are examining today is made in the exercise of that power.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000047"></a>Instead of the reporting accountant scrutiny regime under company law, 14,000 or so charitable companies will instead be required to undergo independent examination under charity law. Independent examination is a low-cost alternative specifically designed for charities. It is a review engagement rather than audit and has proved popular with the sector. Of those charitable companies that will be affected by this change, most will see a slight cost saving under the independent examiner scrutiny regime under charity law. For charitable companies with an income between &#163;10,000 and &#163;90,000,  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it will be a new requirement. However, as the impact assessment to this order makes clear, the vast majority&#151;85 per cent&#151;of charitable companies in this income bracket already opt for independent scrutiny of their accounts. As part of our commitment to proportionate regulation, we are consulting separately on a package of deregulatory proposals for charity law thresholds. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, encouraged us to look carefully at thresholds during the passage of the Bill. The package includes a recommendation to increase the threshold above which independent examination of charity accounts is required from &#163;10,000 to &#163;25,000.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08022680000048"></a>The second change that this order makes relates to the preparation and scrutiny of group accounts by charities. It is already sector practice to prepare group accounts where a charity undertakes activities through subsidiaries. It is important to be able to understand the full range of activities and resources controlled by a charity not only directly, but indirectly through subsidiaries. Until new provisions were set out in the Charities Act 2006, there was no legal basis whatever for non-company charities to prepare such accounts.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000002"></a>This order applies the same group accounts provisions of the Charities Act 2006 to company charities where there is no requirement for small charitable company-headed groups to do so under the Companies Act. In 2007, we published for public consultation a draft of this order, along with draft Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations which will be required to support the implementation of the Charities Act 2006, and this order. The changes to be made by this order were well supported on consultation.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000003"></a>One of the concerns raised on consultation was about the complexity of the way in which the changes are being made to the legislation. Given that this order amends the Charities Act 1993, and that amendments to that Act will also be made by the commencement of provisions of the Charities Act 2006, the Office of the Third Sector will publish, on its website, an informal consolidation of Part 6 of, and Schedule 5A to, the Charities Act 1993, to show the changes that this order and the 2006 Act will make. We hope that this will be helpful to users of the legislation. We are also discussing consolidation of charity law with the Law Commission, with the aim of preparing a consolidation Bill. During the passage of the legislation, noble Lords made particular reference to that&#151;and I think that noble Lords were right. In addition, the Charity Commission will issue updated guidance for charities and their professional advisers on the changes to the audit, accounting and reporting regime.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000004"></a>Our aim is for the provisions of this order to come into force for charities&#146; financial years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. This is to bring these changes in at the earliest opportunity so that charities can benefit from them, as many charities financial years begin on or shortly after 1 April. However, it does give charities and their professional advisers significant time to prepare, as in effect most of the provisions will not bite until charities are preparing accounts and arranging for their scrutiny towards the end of their accounting year, which will not be until April 2009.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000005"></a>The order will bring about changes that were initially approved by Parliament during the passage of the Charities and Companies Acts. The changes will be welcomed by the sector and the majority of its professional advisers, and will support what charities are already doing as a matter of best practice. So we shall reap the benefits of those things. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000006"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Charities Act 2006 (Charitable Companies Audit and Group Accounts Provisions) Order 2008. <I>9th Report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Bassam of Brighton</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="0802272000007"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0802272000056"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining the order. I echo his gratitude for the very thorough work done by my noble friend Lord Hodgson on the legislation when it passed through the House. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, was down to speak on this order today. We all know how busy he has been and I am grateful to the Minister for taking this on.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000008"></a>Can the Minister kindly confirm in simple terms that the order&#146;s effect is, first, that charities that are companies will in future be treated the same as charities that are not so incorporated, and, secondly, that charity companies that own subsidiary companies will be required to prepare consolidated accounts? Assuming that that is correct, and while I am aware that the sector has broadly welcomed the provisions&#151;and I agree that those who donate to charities deserve, of course, to know that their donations are properly dealt with&#151;my prime concern is that of cost, particularly at the smaller end. Charities that are companies with turnovers of as little as &#163;10,001 are now to be subject to audit. As a matter of detail&#151;and the Minister may have referred to this&#151;that is a more stringent procedure than that being applied to charities that are not companies.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000009"></a>Somewhere in the documentation, I see that the Government think that the average cost per charity will be the princely sum of &#163;213. I practised once as an accountant and declare an interest as a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. I have to say that even I have never met an accountant who has charged as little as &#163;213 for anything. Yet, having made this rather odd assumption, the Government go on in their analysis to say that they discount 85 per cent of the total cost to charities across the country on the grounds that many charities already have an audit. It is unclear what their justification for 85 per cent is. It may be that some percentage can fairly be applied, but I am worried about those conclusions in respect of smaller charities, which are surely less likely to have had an audit up to now. Perhaps the Minister can convince me.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000010"></a>Is the preparation of consolidated accounts strictly necessary, again at the very low end? Accounting practice means that the balance sheets of companies that own other companies already include them in  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC164"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their accounts, but as a single line item rather than with each line item being consolidated, and then with notes expanding on the detail. Consolidation is a procedure that adds complication, time and therefore money. Can the Minister convince me that it is absolutely necessary, especially at the smaller end?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000011"></a>The big cost arises from the work in the first year to set up the consolidation. If some charities then, as I will mention in a moment, fall out of the requirement as a result of the threshold being raised, it really will have been a huge waste of their time and money.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000012"></a>Therefore, I ask the Minister whether the Government are not being a little hasty in implementing this order when the lower threshold stands a good chance of being raised as a result of the joint consultation on thresholds between the Office of the Third Sector and the Charity Commission. I think I am right in saying that this is likely to result in some charities becoming subject to the new, stricter rules in one year and then not so subject in the subsequent year. Is that not a complete nonsense? Perhaps the Minister can explain why this cannot be dovetailed properly? Is not the Office of the Third Sector charged with making things easier?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000013"></a>The Charities Act 2006 introduced the requirement for the preparation of group accounts by parent charities. It was to achieve that by inserting Schedule 5A into the 1993 Act. Can the Minister explain, therefore, why neither Part 6 nor Schedule 5A applied to charitable companies?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000014"></a>Lastly, respondents to the consultation on the draft order commented on the complexity of the legislation surrounding this whole area. I am aware that the Office of the Third Sector has stated its intention to prepare a consolidated version of Part 6 of the Charities Act 1993 prior to commencement, but does the Minister understand the importance of the vast majority of donations to charities, many of them small, going directly to the good causes they support rather than into advice from expensive lawyers&#151;in addition to accountants, as we earlier discussed&#151;on how to comply with complicated rules, and that hasty legislation followed by correction does nothing to help them? The Army has a phrase, &#147;Order, counter order, disorder&#148;, which I suggest rather aptly summarises the Government&#146;s actions.</p>

<p><a name="0802272000015"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0802272000057"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> I can be brief due to the clear exposition that the Committee has had of the order and the fact that we on these Benches give it a broad welcome. We endorse the underlying objective trailed in the passage of the primary legislation, which seeks to unify the account scrutiny requirements for small charitable companies. That must be beneficial.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000016"></a>If the impact assessment is to be believed, it seems that the costs are minimal. In the light of what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, said, it is right to say that it is most distressing to those who support small charities if there is mismanagement and any kind of fraud. So I suppose that the balance of argument is in favour of scrutiny, and the simpler that external scrutiny is, the better.</p>




<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000017"></a>The Office of the Third Sector is to be congratulated on the clarity of its impact assessment statement. Admittedly, the facts are not supported by footnotes indicating precisely how they have been accumulated, but the facts are rather compelling. It is interesting that there has been a 10 per cent response to the proposed changes from the consultees and that that response has been entirely positive. I would also, however, like to hear from the Minister why it is that the timing of the order is as it is, in view of the consultation that is in train on raising the financial thresholds. It seems odd that the order should take effect the very day after the consultation is concluded. There has been no attempt to align the order with the outcome of the consultation, on the basis that the Government have put it forward. Broadly, however, the provisions are welcome.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000018"></a>The second part of the change&#151;the proposal for group accounting&#151;seems enormously sensible. However, it also conforms largely to existing practice, and it is, in a sense, ratifying a procedure that is almost universal. When one is talking about small charities, it is important to recognise that the clarity with which the rules are set out is of great importance. What the Minister said about the consolidation appearing on the website is welcome, but, when there is a consolidating Act&#151;I understand that there may be&#151;it will be worth asking parliamentary counsel to look closely at the simplification of language. I know that that is a difficult thing for Ministers to pursue, because they are dealing with legal draftsmen who are not only self-proclaimed but recognised experts. Speaking as someone who was, a long time ago, a consumer protection Minister, I think that we have not succeeded in making our consumer protection legislation and this kind of legislation as accessible to the lay reader as possible. The more accessible it is, the more the rubrics will be observed. The rubrics are not usually broken because of intent but because of lack of awareness. That fortifies the case for a simplification of the language when consolidation takes place. I welcome the order.</p>

<p><a name="0802272000019"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0802272000058"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, was kind enough to refer to my participation in the debates on the Charities Bill and the Companies Bill. It was a Kafkaesque experience. The Minister, reading from his brief, told us that we could not deal with accounting matters because we were dealing with company legislation. His colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, said, when we were dealing with the Companies Bill, that it was all to do with Home Office charity regulations. We were stuck in a situation where everybody was denying the possibility of cutting the Gordian knot. I was pleased that the Government saw the value of doing that and am even more pleased that they have put forward this order to give effect to the work that we did then.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000020"></a>The Minister had some good news for the sector. It is terrific to hear that the thresholds will be raised. The Committee may not be aware that the Government did not accept their own report about the basic threshold level. The original Cabinet Office  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report that set the whole thing going suggested a basic threshold level of a minimum of &#163;10,000. The Government then stuck in &#163;5,000, which meant that 50,000 charities that otherwise would not have fallen under the regulatory regime fell under it. It is terrific that the Government are now going back to what they proposed about five or six years ago.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000021"></a>As these are complex matters, I applaud the proposal to make the website understandable and accessible. Is there a timetable for the consolidation plans? The Committee may not be aware that large chunks of the 1993 Act have never been brought into effect. The whole section on fundraising is still waiting for Godot. It would be kind if we made sure that Godot finally arrived and that the 1992, 1993 and 2006 Acts were put together.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000022"></a>I congratulate the Government on lightening the regulatory burden, which is increasingly needed in the light of the ever increasing length of the accounting SORP. We heard various Members of the Committee say that a couple of pages are added every year.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000023"></a>I have just three questions for the Minister. First, has consultation on the legislation taken place with the ACIE, the Association of Charity Independent Examiners, which is greatly affected by it? Is it happy with the way in which it is being brought into force? Does it think that it is being done in the most effective and practical way?</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000024"></a>The second question deals with a matter of charity law which increasingly concerns me; that is, its applicability across the United Kingdom. As the Minister will recall, we had lengthy discussions about how Scotland would fit into it. Paragraph 2 of the Explanatory Note states that the order will not apply in Scotland because it is a devolved matter. Are conversations with OSCR, the Scottish charity regulator, taking place to ensure that companies of charities that operate on a cross-border basis are able to take advantage of the simplifications? It is frightfully important that proper attention is given to that, because we will not otherwise make the progress that we should in lightening the regulatory burden, which is the Government&#146;s objective.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000025"></a>There is talk about a new charity law for Northern Ireland. It would be helpful, since the Explanatory Notes refer to Northern Ireland, if the Minister updated us with any information that he may have about progress there, and say whether efforts will be made to correlate the provisions in this legislation with what is proposed for the Province.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000026"></a>My third question relates to the final paragraph but two of the Explanatory Notes, which begins:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0802272000052"></a>&#147;Article 8(2) substitutes a new paragraph&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802272000050"></a>It states that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802272000053"></a>&#147;the duty to prepare group accounts will apply to a parent charity which is a company if the charity is not required to prepare consolidated accounts ... The duty will continue to apply even if the charity chooses to prepare consolidated accounts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802272000051"></a>I am not quite clear about which duty is being applied, if the company is already preparing the consolidated accounts in line with the duty referred to earlier in the paragraph. It may be difficult for the Minister to answer that even more technical and detailed question immediately, but if he cannot,  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC167"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>perhaps he could write to Members of the Committee to explain what is being applied there, so that my worries at least could be dispelled.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000027"></a>The Government are to be congratulated on bringing the order forward. It is helpful legislation. I congratulate the Minister on fulfilling the commitments that he made at the Committee stage of the Bill so many months ago.</p>

<p><a name="0802272000028"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0802272000059"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to all three noble Lords who have joined in this deliberation. I congratulate them as ever on their attention to detail, in particular the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts. It was very kind of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, to thank me for stepping in&#151;it is part of the brief; one has to be generic. I was greatly amused by the Kafkaesque description from the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts. He had a good point. I try not to be in denial in those moments, but sometimes it is a parliamentary convenience.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80226-gc0008.htm"/>


<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000029"></a>This order is welcomed in general terms across the charitable sector because it goes a long way to help simplify things and make life easier for some charities. That is an enormous benefit. Like the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, I like to see the money that is given get to where it should to do the job that it should do. The thing that irritates me most on a personal level is when I find out that so much money that has been given gets absorbed and soaked up by unnecessary regulation and unnecessary bureaucracy. That is a common irritation.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000030"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked a number of questions that I shall try to work through. One was whether charities that are companies will be treated the same as non-company charities. Charities that are companies will be required to have their accounts scrutinised as a matter of charity law if they are not required to do so as a matter of company law. He also asked about group accounts. Charities already have to prepare group accounts. It is already sector practice for group accounts to be prepared. The commission looked at a sample of 70 sets of accounts where group accounts are now expected as good practice and in all but one case they had been prepared. Therefore, in our view and in the view of the sector, these changes do not create any significant new costs. Separate regulations will provide for content and scrutiny requirements and will also consider any additional regulatory costs that separate provisions might create.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000031"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether company charities that have subsidiaries will be required to prepare consolidated accounts under the Charities Act 1993. The answer is yes, if they are not required to prepare them as a matter of company law. Another question related to who will have to prepare consolidated accounts. All charities will have to prepare consolidated accounts, but only above a certain threshold. Consultation suggested that a threshold of an income of &#163;500,000 was generally supported.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000032"></a>The noble Lord made a point about charities ending up paying more given the lower threshold for independent examination. Charity Commission  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information indicates that something like 85 per cent of charitable companies affected that have incomes of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;90,000 already have formal scrutiny, which is why we argue that only a small minority will face additional expense. It is already there.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000033"></a>The cost of examination was another issue. The impact assessment indicates that independent examination costs only about &#163;213. The noble Lord thought that was rather low and asked where we got the figure from. In essence, the figure of &#163;213 for the cost of independent examination was derived from the administrative burdens reduction programme, which used a robust and consistent methodology to measure the cost of all government regulation of businesses and charities. The figure is relatively low because it takes account of volunteer independent examiners as well as professionally qualified examiners undertaking such work on fully commercial terms. Volunteers would have been costed, but at a lower rate than professional fees. I am sure we all know charities that use such volunteer labour, which is of tremendous benefit to them.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000034"></a>Below an income of &#163;250,000&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0802272000035"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0802272000060"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> My assumption would be that under the new rules an audit ought to be carried out by someone who holds a practising certificate. That is not normally held by someone who may be a chartered accountant or another form of accountant and audits charities on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p><a name="0802272000036"></a><b><a name="80226-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0802272000061"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am not sure that that is necessarily the case. I shall reflect on the point, but a lot of the auditors that get involved get involved precisely because they have some expertise. At any event, no qualification is required below the &#163;250,000 threshold. That has a beneficial effect because it reduces costs. When a qualified person undertakes an examination on a commercial basis, anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that the costs could rise to between &#163;400 and &#163;500 for charities in the income range of &#163;10,000 to &#163;90,000.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000037"></a>The noble Lord made some other points about changes in thresholds. There are 6,234 company charities with an income of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;90,000, of which data suggest that 85 per cent&#151;some 5,300&#151;undergo some form of independent scrutiny as a matter of best practice. We justify the figure by saying that somewhat less than 1,000&#151;934 company charities&#151;will probably have to go through a process that they have not previously undertaken but, as a matter of best practice, probably should have done.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, rightly asked about the current thresholds review and suggested that we might want to wait for it. We think that it would be wrong to delay the important provisions contained in this order; the sector wants the changes, and if we delayed it beyond 1 April many charities would effectively have to wait a further year for them and lose the benefit of their introduction. They would effectively be waiting until 31 March 2010, which I do  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not think is acceptable, and which I do not think that the charity sector thinks is acceptable.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000039"></a>The thresholds review, published in December 2007, is important. It fulfils a promise that we made to look at thresholds at the time of the Bill being passed. The public consultation on the recommendations runs until the end of March. The thresholds for group accounts were consulted on last year as part of the consultation on separate regulations and, as I said earlier, an income threshold of &#163;500,000 for audit and preparation of group accounts received considerable support. The other scrutiny thresholds that apply to charities are the product of extensive consultation undertaken during production of the 2002 Cabinet Office review, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, made reference.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, raised the issue of consolidation and whether it would be a better approach to group accounts. Single-line consolidation has some disadvantages. We need to be able to see the variety of activities that charity and its subsidiaries undertake. The noble Lord made a reasonable point about simplifying legislation and making it more accessible. It is a sad story that we try to encourage a broad range of giving from people from all walks of life and ranges of income, but understanding how charities work is something that comes largely through and is mediated by professionals. Perhaps that is unavoidable, but we do our best to try to make these things as accessible as possible. The Office of the Third Sector and the Charity Commission have done valuable work in trying to ensure that that is the case and last year published a plain language guide to the Charities Act 2006 that was aimed at trustees, who have found it very useful. It has become a very popular publication.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000041"></a>The point was also made about SORP being too complex and lengthy for charities. It is fair to say that it does not apply to all small charities&#151;those with an income under &#163;100,000 that choose to produce simple receipts and payments accounts, which would be the majority of charities. The SORP has the difficult job of interpreting and applying the complex financial reporting standards to charities. Standards are developed independently of government by the Accounting Standards Board and in future by the international financing reporting board. While this gives independence in the development of standards, it creates an onus for the SORP to address and interpret all relevant standards for the sector. That said, last year saw the formation of a new SORP committee, and early indications from that group are that the needs of small charities and the relevant information required by the SORP will be very much at the top of the agenda.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000042"></a>I think that I was also asked whether we had properly consulted the ACIE&#151;the examiners. It was very supportive of the approach that we have  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>adopted. It responded to the consultation and the Charity Commission is in regular contact with it.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, made a point about the variations between the devolved Administrations. The position, certainly for Northern Ireland, is that the existing reporting accountant regime will be preserved by the Companies Act commencement order that BERR is preparing. The order will result in the partial commencement of Section 1175 for Great Britain only, the saving for Northern Ireland and the special rules for the audit of small charitable companies, including the provisions on reporting accountants.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000044"></a>As to cross-border regulation, it is fair to say that there have been some difficulties for some English and Welsh charities that operate in Scotland, particularly in registering with the charity regulator. As charity law and regulations are devolved, responsibility must rest with the OSCR and the Scottish Government. However, we have consistently stressed the importance of minimising regulatory burdens arising from the different regulatory regimes that charities operate in across the UK. These issues have been raised by both the Charity Commission and the Office of the Third Sector with their Scottish counterparts, and I think that that dialogue is proving to be very useful. Of course, there is the UK regulators&#146; forum, which I know came up as part of the discussion during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000045"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, asked about a couple of other points relating to the timetable for the consolidation of charity law. I cannot give a straight answer, although I should like to, or provide the noble Lord with a timetable. It is a matter outwith our control and is very much in the hands of the Law Commission. I would not wish to damn the Law Commission with faint praise, but it believes in doing a thorough job and that means that things inevitably take their time. However, we are in what are described as &#147;positive discussions&#148; with the Law Commission about consolidation and those have been very helpful. </p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000046"></a>I think that the noble Lord asked one other question about Article 8.2. I cannot remember exactly what it was but I shall write to him on that point.</p>

<a name="80226-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0802272000047"></a>I hope that I have covered most of the issues that were raised. If I have not, I shall check carefully in <I>Hansard&#151;</I>and I am sure that the officials will check even more carefully&#151;and we will respond in writing. Again, I thank the three noble Lords who have participated in this debate. The charity sector is well served by their diligence, and I hope that the order brings about the beneficial changes that we all anticipate and expect from it.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08022648000009"></a><b><a name="80226-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08022648000108"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Department of Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08022648000010"></a>I am today announcing the publication of the Government&#146;s response to the Blackpool task force report <I>An Action Plan for Sustainable Growth</I>. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses and on my department&#146;s website.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08022648000011"></a>In March last year the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport invited a task force to review the totality of economic, social and environmental development plans in the Blackpool area. The Blackpool task force comprised senior representation from Blackpool Council, ReBlackpool, English Partnerships, the Northwest Regional Development Agency and Government Office North West.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08022648000012"></a>The task force reported in July 2007 and made a number of observations and recommendations. Since that date, the Government have been actively engaged in discussions with Blackpool, national and regional agencies about how best to take forward the recommendations. On 1 February, the Secretary of State for Transport announced a centrepiece of the Government&#146;s response to the task force, confirming a &#163;85 million investment of public funds to renew Blackpool&#146;s trams. This and other announcements are contained in the response I am publishing today, which includes:</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08022648000013"></a><I>Education and skills</I></p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08022648000014"></a>Over &#163;100 million will be spent on a complete overhaul of Blackpool&#146;s education facilities, including new schools, a new town centre further education campus, a new higher education facility and major investment in skills training. This investment is vital to produce the highly skilled and qualified workforce that Blackpool needs to diversify from its traditional but declining employment base.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08022648000015"></a><I>Transport</I></p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08022648000016"></a>A &#163;100 million boost to local transport is underway, with an announcement earlier this month for a modernised tram system, together with investments to improve the airport and important studies to take forward rail and road improvements. Improved connectivity is vital to bring not just visitors but also new investors and jobs to Blackpool and its Fylde Coast neighbours.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08022648000018"></a>&#163;82 million already committed to improve the beach and resort offer, with improved seafront defences, investment in events and a promise to respond constructively to bids from Blackpool for investment in the illuminations and further beachfront improvements.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08022648000020"></a>The NWDA is investing, with ReBlackpool, to take forward major town centre regeneration including Talbot Gateway. This initiative, together with environmental improvements, will help restore Blackpool&#146;s position as a major shopping and sub-regional centre.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08022648000022"></a>English Partnerships will be investing an initial &#163;35 million in the South Beach and North Beach areas to help improve the housing mix and create more mixed communities. Housing investment will help to reduce the surplus of unsuitable houses of multiple occupation and stimulate private sector investment in improved hotels and housing.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08022648000024"></a>The Government applaud the co-operation between Blackpool and its Fylde Coast neighbours on a multi-area agreement, and the recognition that economic regeneration needs joined-up work both within the town and with neighbouring authorities.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08022648000025"></a>Other recommendations in the report will be the subject of feasibility studies and funding bids, and I am pleased to note the co-operation between the NWDA, English Partnerships, HEFCE, Government Office North West and Blackpool in developing future plans.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08022648000026"></a>The regional director, Government Office North West, will report to me on progress on a quarterly basis for the next year, and I intend to visit Blackpool within a year to discuss progress on regeneration.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="08022648000035"></a><b><a name="80226-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="08022648000110"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Department of Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08022648000036"></a>I am today announcing the publication of a review of the Alternative Approaches to Regional Casino-led Regeneration prepared by my officials. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08022648000037"></a>In July last year the Prime Minister asked me to undertake this review, in recognition of the lack of consensus in Parliament about regional casinos in light of the potential of a regional casino to increase problem gambling within the regional catchment area. The then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport in announcing the review on 16 July 2007 said &#147;it would be prudent to examine afresh whether deprived areas can be equally well served by other forms of regeneration&#148;.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08022648000038"></a>The aim of the review has been to examine the evidence of whether regional casinos are the best way to regenerate specific deprived areas. It has drawn heavily on evidence within the various documents submitted to the Casino Advisory Panel for the licensing of a regional casino, published literature on casinos specifically and the benefits of regeneration more generally. A list of these points of reference is included in the document.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08022648000039"></a>Specifically the review examined:</p>
 what is the regeneration need which casinos are thought to meet and what is the nature of the market failures involved;what are the economic benefits of casino-led regeneration;what are the economic and social costs of casino-led regeneration; and what are the alternatives to casino-led regeneration could be considered.  


<notus-date day="26" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS70"></a><b>26 Feb 2008 : Column WS70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08022648000040"></a>The review highlights the difficulty in establishing the evidence base for the generic benefits of casinos because the source material is strongly influenced by specific location factors, and by the underpinning purpose of individual pieces of research. In particular, there are uncertainties about the scale of the benefits of a regional casino for job creation; about the wider benefits to an area from multiplier effects; or about the degree of additionality a casino would bring to existing activities. Moreover, the leakage effects&#151;where new jobs are filled by commuters not locals limiting the benefits to the immediate area of the casino&#151;is potentially higher than other forms of regeneration because pay within casinos is relatively high and training opportunities make it attractive to people already in employment. Finally, the review concludes that, as with most regeneration projects, there are economic and social costs associated with casino-led regeneration. In the case of a regional casino there are potentially significant costs that would arise as a result of an increase in compulsive gambling.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08022648000041"></a>The review does recognise that the unique nature of a regional casino, especially in terms of inward investment, would make it challenging for any one of the alternatives the review examines in isolation to achieve the scale of benefits that could be secured through a regional casino. However, when the potential economic and social costs are factored in alongside the uncertainties around the extent to which the benefits of a regional casino are truly additional then the difference could be much reduced or even eliminated if a number of alternative options are packaged together.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08022648000051"></a>The performance of First Great Western has persistently fallen short of its customers' expectations and has been unacceptable to both passengers and Government.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08022648000052"></a>I can inform the House today that First Great Western has breached its franchise agreement by exceeding the limits on cancellations, and also by misreporting those cancellations.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08022648000053"></a>I can now outline the measures I have taken, and the actions I have agreed with First Great Western, which were reported in an announcement by First plc to the Stock Exchange before the markets opened this morning.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08022648000054"></a>First, I am today issuing First Great Western with a remedial plan notice for exceeding the threshold on cancellations which resulted in a breach of its franchise agreement. In response to this notice, First Great Western will submit a remedial plan for addressing this level of cancellations. Discussions are at an advanced stage on what the plan will contain.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08022648000055"></a>Secondly, I am also today issuing First Great Western with a breach notice for misreporting its cancellations.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08022648000056"></a>Thirdly, and importantly for those using First Great Western services, a substantial package of additional benefits for passengers has been agreed.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08022648000057"></a>First Great Western&#146;s franchise contains strict limits on delays and cancellations; specifies the circumstances in which the franchise is in breach, and more seriously still, those circumstances which constitute an event of default; and it sets out the remedies for correcting poor performance.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08022648000058"></a>Every four weeks, the company reports the number of cancellations, and may claim adjustments to the headline number in line with the provisions of the franchise. My department tests any such claims, allowing only those we agree with. Typically we reach final agreement on performance within six weeks of the end of the reporting period.</p>

<a name="80226-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="08022648000059"></a>For the period ending in mid-September 2007, there were a substantial number of claimed cancellation adjustments, which were then scrutinised by my department. Early in November 2007, before a conclusion could be reached, First Great Western informed the department that it had discovered that it had been miscalculating the base numbers of train cancellations. Over subsequent weeks it carried out an internal audit of its method of calculating cancellations which uncovered several errors in the methodology, which First Great Western has now corrected.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="08022648000060"></a>First Great Western now accepts that it breached the franchise agreement from August to December 2007 in respect of cancellations. I will therefore be issuing later today a remedial plan notice.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="08022648000061"></a>This requires First Great Western to submit to me a remedial plan, to bring the standard of services back to acceptable levels, and it will be contractualised as a remedial agreement.

Consequently, CCS would be covered in the same way as other abatement technologies already within the scope of the scheme, ensuring that the EU ETS remains technology neutral. It is not currently envisaged that CCS should be incorporated into the scheme by means of credits or that it should in any way affect the role of CDM within the EU ETS.</p>

Reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions directly from healthcare professionals and patients (through the yellow card scheme) and from pharmaceutical companies forms one of the most important data sources used by MHRA. Newly licensed medicines undergo intensive monitoring through this scheme and are assigned a &#147;black triangle&#148; in product literature to signify this to healthcare professionals.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_267"></a><a name="08022654000339"></a>VOSA does not record the nationality of drivers. There were very few prosecutions for these specific offences because it is not possible&#151;either for VOSA or the police&#151;to require non-UK residents to return to the UK to attend court on such matters. The introduction of graduated fixed penalties and deposits will, however, ensure that they do pay the relevant penalty.</p>

In addition, three foreign drivers received prison sentences for dangerous driving related to gross breaches of the drivers&#146; hours regulations.</p>
