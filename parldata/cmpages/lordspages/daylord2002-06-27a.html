<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Tebbit </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for transport policy in his own constituency.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 sets out the division of transport responsibilities. The reserved functions for which the Secretary of State for Transport is responsible include transport safety and regulation, such as for the railways and aviation, some aspects of road traffic regulation, such as vehicle standards, and transport security.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that Answer, which might have been broadly and more shortly expressed as, "No, not in most cases". Is not this the West Lothian question incarnate? The English and Welsh electorate have policies imposed on them by Scots members of the Cabinet&#151;to whom they have given no authorisation&#151;which do not apply to Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I try to be more helpful than just saying, "Not in most cases". I thought it would be useful to set out the responsibilities that the right honourable Member for Edinburgh Central holds. There have been Scottish Secretaries of State for Transport before. Sir Malcolm Rifkind was Secretary of State for Transport from 1990 to 1992, at a time when a considerable number of transport responsibilities were held by the then Scottish Office.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the West Lothian question is an acceptable constitutional anomaly, that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, has found a somewhat half-hearted example, that the West Lothian question is a balancing measure for historical offences against Scotland and that it will be partially resolved by devolution in England? Finally, will the Minister confirm that today's United Kingdom is Scotland's finest achievement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure which two of those questions I am supposed to answer. I understand that if there are more than two, I have a choice. It is interesting that since the passage <P>


<a name="column_1500"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1500</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Scotland Act 1998, there has been very little reference to the West Lothian question. The arrangements seem to have bedded down particularly well. We have maintained the position that there are not two classes of Member of Parliament. Everybody is to be congratulated on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I have a supplementary West Lothian question. What is the proportion of Scots to other nationalities in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and what is the proportion of Scots to other members of the population of the United Kingdom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware that Scots is a nationality. It does not say so on anybody's passport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that those of us who take an interest in transport issues will regard ourselves as fortunate to have such a talented and imaginative Secretary of State as Alastair Darling, as the Statement on Railtrack later this afternoon will show?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will agree wholeheartedly with my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, when the noble Lord uses the comparison between Alastair Darling and Malcolm Rifkind, he is clearly losing the argument. Devolution has entirely changed the process between the Scotland Office and the Scottish Parliament. Is not the real reason why Mr Darling has been given the job that his parliamentary seat is about to be done away with under the redrawing of the boundaries? This is all about seeking to ingratiate himself in England so that he can get a seat in England.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, Alastair Darling has been a first class member of the Government since 1997. He does not need to ingratiate himself with anybody.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, is there any case for restricting the Prime Minister's choice of Secretary of State for Transport in the way in which the Question implies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, none whatsoever.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, is it not abundantly clear in this melee of talk that the Cabinet could certainly do with an infusion of sensible Welsh blood?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend the Lord Privy Seal has answered that sotto voce. He agrees with the noble Lord, Lord Roberts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, are there any proposals to compensate Members of the other place who may lose their seats as a result of doing away with a number of the seats in Scotland?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we are not just getting away from the original Question; we are two steps away from it. I do not know the answer.

<P>

<a name="20627-01_time0"></a><H5>3.6 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B>  asked the Chairman of Committees:
<P>
<UL>Whether the medical emergency cover within the Parliamentary Estate is adequate.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Tordoff): </B>  My Lords, the House authorities keep the provision of medical cover constantly under review. Recent initiatives include the installation of automatic external defibrillators adjacent to this Chamber. Regrettably, in one case in December last year there was an unacceptable delay before an ambulance was called. However, I assure noble Lords that steps have been taken to ensure that such delays do not occur in future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Chairman of Committees for that Answer. Is he really satisfied that emergency procedures inside and outside the House have been improved since the unacceptable delay that my noble friend Lady Blatch had to endure, in great pain, waiting for an ambulance? Is he concerned that parliamentarians and staff&#151;there are up to 5,000 people working in the parliamentary estate at any one time&#151;appear to have only basic emergency cover after 5 p.m. when the nurse knocks off?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, the emergency cover is precisely the same after 5 p.m. as it is before 5 p.m. The provision of the nurse is not for emergency cover. The point of emergency cover is to recover the patient, to resuscitate the patient and to get him or her to hospital as quickly as possible. In the case of the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that did not happen. However, I emphasise that the delay was not with the ambulance service; it was internal. The telephone operator took a long time to pass the message through to St Thomas' Hospital, because they were checking on various things at great length. That is partly because there have been a number of spurious phone calls to the 3333 emergency number, so those concerned were making sure that this was a serious case. Instructions have now been given that when emergencies on 3333 originate from here, the first thing to do is make sure that an ambulance is on its way.
<P>

<a name="20627-01_para0"></a>I can give the noble Lord a few more details about that case. The call to the central ambulance control was not logged until 7.56 p.m., although the original call here was made at 7.30 p.m. After that, the ambulance arrived at 8.11 p.m. and was with the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, at 8.14 p.m. The ambulance service is in no way to blame for the delay that occurred on that occasion and we have taken steps to ensure that such a delay does not occur again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, on a good many occasions over the past two years, I have been <P>


<a name="column_1502"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1502</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>called upon to offer medical advice within this House&#151;the last occasion being this morning. Sometimes I have been asked to do so in curious locations, including, once, in the ladies' toilet. Is it not reasonable to have nursing cover in the evenings after 5 p.m.? After all, so far as I am concerned&#151;I am sure that ultimately this may apply to many other medical Peers&#151;if the General Medical Council's regulations on revalidation are soon to be introduced, it is possible that I shall be precluded from giving such advice on the ground of age.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, if I may say so, they must be precluding people at a very early age. We anticipate that in the near future nursing care will be able to continue until 10 p.m. However, I emphasise that nursing care is not strictly part of the emergency service; it is for normal day-to-day, simple medical assistance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Roper: </B>   My Lords, all parts of the House will be relieved that a review of the procedures in the telephone exchange has taken place so that unacceptable delays of the kind that occurred previously will not be repeated. However, I should be grateful for an assurance that continuous training is being given in the use of the defibrillators which have been provided and that access to oxygen is now readily available, as I understand that problems have occurred in that respect in the past.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020627/text/20627-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, it is true that early last year there was difficulty in accessing the oxygen supply. That has now been dealt with. But one must be clear that the administration of oxygen is not a simple, straightforward matter. Regular training is now given in the use of the medical equipment here. As I said, the defibrillators are outside the Chamber. Regrettably, there was an occasion when Lord Shore of Stepney collapsed in the Chamber, and the Doorkeepers administered the defibrillators to very good effect. Sadly, of course, Lord Shore died later in hospital. But we are convinced that that equipment is working well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, we are all conscious of the fact that the Parliamentary Estate is not covered by the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. Given the large number of people who are in this building at almost any given time, why cannot the estate have cover by analogy with such outside legislation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I am not sure that I know the answer to that. However, as I said, it is our belief that we are extremely well covered in relation to emergencies. Perhaps I may take the opportunity of welcoming the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, back to his place after his serious operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, does the Chairman of Committees agree that, instead of the nurse being employed until 10 o'clock, it would be far better if the House rose at 7 o'clock, thus dealing with the problem the other way round?
<P>


<a name="column_1503"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spmin2"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I am sure that the nurse would be pleased to have an early evening. However, I do not believe that that is a matter for this debate; it is a matter for the report of the Leader of the House on the workings of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord explain his remark about oxygen being difficult to administer? All dentists are obliged to make oxygen available in their surgeries. Even the most untrained person is expected to be able to use it. I am able to quote instances when lives have been saved through oxygen being available to people who have suffered heart attacks. Can the noble Lord explain why he considers oxygen to be difficult to use? In addition, is he willing to have oxygen available in the same location as the defibrillators, if that is not already the case? In that way, both would be available at the same source and people would know exactly where to go for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spmin3"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, oxygen is available. I am saying only that I believe that it can be a little dangerous when handled by the untrained, or so I am informed. The noble Baroness looks at me sceptically, but what is new? That is my understanding, although I may be wrong. I have no medical training, but people other than the Doorkeepers are usually available. The Doorkeepers are now properly trained and oxygen is available. I simply suggest that ordinary Members of the House should not rush to the oxygen bottle and try to administer it because they might do more harm than good.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, is the Chairman of Committees aware that the nurses' hours were cut by changing their finishing time from 6 p.m. to 5 p.m.? What was the reason for that? Is he aware that some people must be monitored for certain conditions and that, if the nursing service were available, that would prevent emergencies arising?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spmin4"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I do not know why that change was made. However, I understand that a system is to be introduced whereby the nurses overlap and that someone will be on duty until 10 o'clock in the evening. I am not sure when that arrangement will begin, but that is my understanding.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   My Lords, further to the observations and questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, I know for a fact that the Chairman of Committees is aware that from time to time I have to use oxygen and that it is readily available. It is provided by the health workers in the Houses of Parliament. But is he aware that the bottle to which I have access needs to be replaced and that the occupational health workers are being very obstructive in replacing it?

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="20627-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What their reaction is to traffic conditions at Vauxhall Cross and the junction of Vauxhall Bridge and Millbank.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is a matter for the Mayor and Transport for London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I cannot possibly thank the Minister for that reply. Does he realise the spin-off effect on other bridges caused by the chaos at Vauxhall Cross? Can he explain to me why huge pavements have been built at the corners of Vauxhall Bridge north side? Are they there to accommodate vast crowds applauding Ken Livingstone as he queues in his car for the lights to turn green?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not know. To be honest, I believe that time for Starred Questions in this House is scarce and valuable. Perhaps I may suggest most humbly to the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, whom I admire and respect, that as far as possible we should restrict our Questions to matters for which Ministers have responsibility. David Jamieson, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Transport, wrote to the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, in response to an earlier undertaking by my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer. Clearly we try to be as helpful as we can on these matters. There is nothing out of order in asking a Question for which Ministers have no responsibility. However, does the House not agree that it would be better if, as far as possible, we concentrated on matters for which Ministers have responsibility?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the Question was in order because it was accepted and that he has a responsibility to answer Questions from the Front Bench as best he can? Indeed, the problem at Vauxhall Cross is caused by the Mayor changing the timing of the lights. Will he condemn those changes and answer the Question that he <P>


<a name="column_1505"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1505</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>avoided answering last week? Perhaps I may suggest that the reason he should answer it is that significant road safety considerations are now at issue. The Government have a road safety programme, and, unfortunately, at Vauxhall Cross motorists are jumping the lights because they do not change in time. Serious accidents will occur and the Government should address that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I said in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, that the Question was in order. However, in so far as there is ministerial responsibility, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is right to say that there is a ministerial responsibility for road safety.
<P>

<a name="20627-02_para0"></a>There are two elements to what has happened at Vauxhall Cross. The first is the rejigging of the road pattern, and I understand that safety elements are involved in that. The other is a cycle and pedestrian scheme, which is very directly connected with road safety because it follows a fatality which occurred a few years ago. That cycle and pedestrian scheme was completed on 16th June. However, the noble Viscount is right to say that there are safety elements to the work at Vauxhall Cross.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that if the Mayor had discharged his traffic responsibilities with even a modicum of diligence there would be no need for my noble friend the ask the Question? Where else can she ask it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the responsibilities of the Mayor are to his electorate and to the Greater London Assembly. Members of the Greater London Assembly have full opportunity to question the Mayor and to disagree with him about any of these matters. The same is true of any local authority in this country. On the whole, we do not answer Questions about matters which are the responsibility of individual local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there is a parliamentary dimension to this issue for anyone who lives on the south side of the river, such as my noble friend Lady Trumpington and me? It was reported on the radio two or three times last month alone that the estimated delay in crossing Vauxhall Bridge was over one hour. That feeds across to other bridges. From time to time south London is isolated from north London and also from the centre of government as a result of those policies. That must be of interest to the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am keenly aware of the extent of ministerial responsibility for transport in London. That is why I sought to answer the question raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. However, questions of congestion in Greater London <P>


<a name="column_1506"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1506</B></P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that there might be merit in considering whether the practice in the House of Commons, whereby Questions for which there is no ministerial responsibility are not accepted, could be adopted at this end of the building?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is a matter for the House to decide rather than for an individual Minister. However, I am sure that my friends who are responsible for such matters in the House have heard that question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, having once had the dubious responsibility of being Secretary of State for Transport, I clearly recall being asked many times about traffic jams and traffic problems in the capital. I recall being advised that perhaps the best answer was that while such matters were the responsibility of local authorities, it is the duty of the Government, and the proper course to take, to state that they would draw to the attention of the local authority&#151;there was not a mayor in those days&#151;most closely and vigorously the strong concerns of Members of the other place. That would apply now just as much to Members of this House. Is it not the duty of the Government to draw those strong concerns to the attention of the Mayor of London so that he can get a better act together?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is a helpful and sensible suggestion. I shall certainly draw to the attention of the Mayor and to Transport for London the concerns which have been expressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may remind the Minister that my noble friend's Question is analogous to one I asked some days ago about the traffic congestion at the eastern end of Westminster Bridge. In this part of London we have some of the worst traffic congestion and heaviest traffic of anywhere in the United Kingdom. Surely, the Minister for Transport has a responsibility to persuade the local authorities to solve the problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have great difficulty with the concept that the responsibility of the Minister for Transport is to persuade the local authority of his own views on matters which have been devolved to the Mayor and to Transport for London. There is a read back to the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, of which we should be well aware. The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, thought that the Minister for Transport was not capable of dealing with matters which are devolved to Scotland; and I believe that is true. I shall draw to the attention of the Mayor and Transport for London the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Renton.

<P>
<UL>How they intend to ensure that their aim to improve the welfare of laying hens in the United Kingdom does not result in egg production moving overseas to countries with lower welfare standards.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, the directive on the welfare of laying hens applies to all member states of the European Union and we directly transposed it into English legislation only last Friday. Any further proposals on the welfare of laying hens will be subject to public consultation. As regards the application to third countries, the EU has been successful in getting animal welfare firmly written into the Doha development agenda. The labelling of eggs has a vital role to play, and improved labelling from 2004 will help consumers to decide.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. I am pleased that the Government are going out to consultation on this issue. Liberal Democrats fully support improving the welfare of laying hens. However, the Government may decide that regulations in Britain should be imposed in such a way to bring about the end of cages altogether for hens. Surely, the Government have a greater responsibility to promote the excellence of British food so that British people buy a far greater proportion of eggs of free-range hens. At present, I believe, that proportion is only 80 per cent. Can the Government take steps to ensure that public procurement bodies, which buy eggs for school meals, hospital meals, and so forth, take account of animal welfare issues in their specifications?

<P>

<A NAME="20627-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the Government&#151;in particular, this part of the Government&#151;spend a considerable time promoting the excellence of British food, including the produce of the British poultry industry. I agree that we should continue to do so and try to persuade British consumers of that excellence. However, at the end of the day we operate a free market and there is consumer choice. The labelling regulations will help in this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, I am totally baffled by the Question and the argument put forward. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, seems to advocate that any time there is an effort to improve animal welfare, it has to be stopped because someone overseas might take away trade. Surely, that cannot be the position of the Liberal Democrats?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer for the Liberal Democrats. The position of the Government is that so far as possible such regulations should be <P>


<a name="column_1508"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conducted on a European basis. However, there may be areas in which we believe the British regulations need to be slightly different. In general, we shall not be gold-plating within Europe. Beyond Europe, this becomes a trade issue, which is why I referred in my Answer to the Doha round.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Elliott of Morpeth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that bringing forward the timing of the abolition of the inhumane method of egg production, which the battery cage represents, will be much appreciated by a number of welfare organisations and many individuals such as myself?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, for those noble Lords who were not present on Friday, I can confirm that the noble Lord, Lord Elliott, gave an effective speech to that end. I indicated then that we were in the process of transposing the regulations and that there would be more consultation on whether to bring forward any further the abolition of cages and how to deal with enriched cages.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches believe strongly in the promotion of animal welfare, as I am sure does the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Our farmers have led the field on that issue, as perhaps the Minister would acknowledge. Can I press further on the consultation period? At present, DEFRA has commissioned scientific research into the cases for enriched cages or non-enriched cages. I understand that such consultations are going ahead before we have the scientific evidence, which is of concern. Surely, that is the wrong way round. We should wait for the research to be completed before going out to consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the issue of what is public opinion and what is the view of the industry is one aspect; the research is another. We have indicated that we are seeking the views of the public and the industry. There will be the normal 12-week period of consultation. The research may well eventually inform the final decision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Peel: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister telling the House that the Government are prepared to take action against the importation of eggs produced by hens abroad which are not kept to the same welfare standards as hens in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I indicated in my original Answer that animal welfare in this area as a whole is an issue that the EU put on the table in the discussions in the Doha round. I also indicated that in order that consumers can better distinguish between the methods of egg production&#151;wherever they are produced&#151;we have introduced labelling regulations which will come into effect from 2004, so that consumers can decide.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is no point in introducing these regulations if we simply export cruelty to other countries?

<A NAME="20627-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, British consumers and the British public expect certain minimum standards of production within the UK. However, it is also right that if one simply transfers consumer demand to the import of foreign goods where the welfare standards are not so good, one is in part defeating the object. That is why we want to move largely on a European basis and why we believe that animal welfare should feature in the trade negotiations.

<A NAME="20627-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster   (Lord Macdonald of Tradeston): </B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20627-03_para0"></a>"I would like to make a Statement on the progress being made to put the ownership and operation of the rail network on a sound and sustainable footing; and as part of that the steps being taken to get Railtrack out of administration.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para1"></a>"I will keep the House informed over the next few weeks, but in the light of the conclusion of the sale and purchase agreement this morning between Railtrack Group and Network Rail, I thought it right to come to the House to set out the Government's strategy, the progress made so far and the next steps.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para2"></a>"As the House knows, the High Court put Railtrack into administration last October. As the presiding judge said then, the making of the railway administration order was,
 'not only appropriate, but absolutely essential'.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para3"></a>"The Government's objective is to ensure that Britain's rail network is owned and managed by an effective and competent body and so secure a sustainable long-term future for the rail network.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para4"></a>"To achieve that, the next step is to remove Railtrack from administration as soon as possible and have the network under new ownership and strengthened management, who are committed to improving service and safety. That is in everyone's interests: the industry's, that of the workforce and the travelling public alike.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para5"></a>"On 25th March this year, my right honourable friend, the Member for North Tyneside, told the House of the bid made by Network Rail to acquire Railtrack from its parent company, Railtrack Group plc.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para6"></a>"While other bids would have been considered, none was received. Network Rail is a public interest company limited by guarantee and will be run for the benefit of the whole railway, concentrating on its core priorities of operating, maintaining and renewing the rail network. There will be no shareholders and any operating surplus will be used for the benefit of the railway system.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1510"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1510</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para7"></a>"The company will operate on a sound commercial basis with a board and management whose performance targets will be aligned to the Strategic Rail Authority's long-term plan as well as the obligations under its network licence to its customers.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para8"></a>"Instead of shareholders, its directors will be accountable to the company's members who will not only be drawn from the rail industry, but will also include members representing the public interest and the Strategic Rail Authority. In this way, the directors of Network Rail will be answerable to people whose primary interest is in the long-term future of the railway.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para9"></a>"Railtrack Group and Network Rail have concluded a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Railtrack plc. I would like to set out in some detail the terms of this agreement.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para10"></a>"In line with its original offer, Network Rail will pay £500 million&#151;of which £300 million will be provided by the Government&#151;as well as taking over Railtrack's debt, which now stands at £7.1 billion. This includes loans from the European Investment Bank and the German bank, KfW, totalling just over £1 billion, which Network Rail plans to assume.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para11"></a>"In parallel, London and Continental Railways is acquiring from Railtrack its interest in the first phase of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link for £295 million. At a cost of £80 million, Network Rail will acquire the right to operate, manage and maintain the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and the concession to manage St Pancras station.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para12"></a>"I can tell the House that Network Rail has already secured up to £9 billion of bridge financing from commercial banks to fund its acquisition costs and to refinance Railtrack's existing debt, as well as to fund the immediate operation of the railway.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para13"></a>"Network Rail will also put in place additional commercial financing of up to £7 billion for its medium term requirements. This is necessary to cover operational expenditure as well as to cover substantial cost overruns which were inherited from Railtrack and which will have to be met.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para14"></a>"Network Rail will also need to have&#151;as would any owner and operator&#151;access to back-stop contingency funding. For this reason, the Strategic Rail Authority will provide an additional standby credit facility. This contingency funding of last resort has been set at £4 billion.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para15"></a>"Further details of this funding and of the short to medium term standby credit facilities offered to Network Rail by the Strategic Rail Authority are set out in the two minutes that I am laying before the House in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para16"></a>"The House will also wish to know that the rail regulator has today issued a statement setting out his approach to a request for an early regulatory review.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1511"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1511</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para17"></a>"These are large sums by any standards. But they are necessary, given the size of the task facing Network Rail, and they would be needed by any successor to Railtrack. There is no escaping the fact that Britain's railways need very large-scale investment&#151;investment we believe is essential.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para18"></a>"It is because of the need for long-term sustained investment that the Government are, through the 10-year plan, increasing the average annual investment in the railways&#151;on top of continued support for running costs&#151;to £4.6 billion. That is more than three times the annual average in the 10 years prior to 1997.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para19"></a>"The public are entitled to expect that this investment will be spent efficiently and effectively. That has clearly not been the case in the past.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para20"></a>"The new company, Network Rail, faces a legacy of poor management and of very substantial cost overruns, which will have to be met. For example, when it began, Railtrack estimated that the cost of the West Coast Main Line project would amount to about £2 billion. It is now clear that the actual costs of the work will be considerably more than that.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para21"></a>"So what is now needed is a competent owner and operator. That is why Network Rail's acquisition of the railway network is so essential to the future of the industry.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para22"></a>"This agreement is a major step towards removing Railtrack from administration and putting the rail network back on a sound footing.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para23"></a>"The next stage in the process will involve Railtrack Group plc putting this offer to its shareholders at a special meeting which is expected to be held next month. It is for the company to decide how much it can offer its shareholders.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para24"></a>"The European Commission is also considering whether any aspect of the support being provided needs to be cleared as state aid.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para25"></a>"However, if the shareholders of Railtrack Group approve the bid at the special meeting and the appropriate clearance is obtained from the European Commission, I would expect to ask the High Court for an order releasing Railtrack plc from administration thereafter.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para26"></a>"It is obvious that Railtrack could not have carried on as it was. Even the company recognised that last summer. And what is more, the division and lack of common purpose that characterised the railway system in the past few years were damaging and destructive to the interests of both the industry and the travelling public.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para27"></a>"All the evidence shows that working together is crucial to the long-term success of the railway network. I can tell the House that over the past few months, despite the uncertainties of administration, the new management of Railtrack has enjoyed closer working relationships with the Strategic Rail Authority, as well as the rail regulator and the train operators&#151;something which is essential if the network is to work effectively and efficiently to everyone's benefit.

<a name="20627-03_para28"></a>"The establishment of a public interest company in which the Strategic Rail Authority is represented will continue to foster this climate of better co-operation to the benefit of all concerned in terms of achieving the objectives set.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para29"></a>"The railways are of critical importance to the economic and social fabric of this country. There is now an urgent need to give the rail system stability. I believe that this agreement is the right and best way of building a modern and efficient network.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para30"></a>"I commend this Statement to the House".

<a name="20627-03_para31"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-03_spnew18"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. Does that mean that he is now responsible for transport matters in this House and will be answering Questions for that department?
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para32"></a>The one bit of vaguely good news is that the Government have made a U-turn and are now paying £300 million to the Railtrack shareholders. I should remind the Government that almost 90 per cent of Railtrack employees are also shareholders in the company. Will the Government now admit&#151;I do not suppose that they will&#151;that Railtrack was not insolvent, it was the Government who made it insolvent? Indeed, I believe that the Government misled the High Court. They made Railtrack insolvent by withdrawing funding.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para33"></a>To turn to Network Rail, it is a public interest company. Can the Minister define that? It will not have any shareholders, so who will own it? Perhaps he can give us an example of other similar companies in the government portfolio with which we can compare it. Or is it something of totally new invention? I understand that its accounts will appear in the accounts of the Strategic Rail Authority. Does that make it a subsidiary of the SRA? Will it have independent auditors? Who will be responsible for the audit?
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para34"></a>The Government say that they will stand behind the £14 billion of debt funding by a letter of comfort from the Secretary of State. The minute states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State would intervene in a timely manner to ensure that adequate funds would be made available to the SRA, or any successor body".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-03_para35"></a>
How will the Treasury account for those letters of comfort? Will that be on the Treasury books?
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para36"></a>The public interest company will be accountable to its members. I understand that it will have 120 members. How will they be selected? I understand that that will be done by a special committee. Who will appoint the special committee? Will there be more than one person? Will it be the Secretary of State? How many directors will the company have? Presumably, it will not have all of those members on its board. How will the new entity be accountable to Parliament?
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para37"></a>As I understand it, Network Rail will be responsible for track maintenance and special purpose vehicles will be set up for improvements to the rail system. <P>


<a name="column_1513"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Those vehicles will then sell the track to the SRA after they have improved it. Who will decide the price? How will that be decided? We want to ensure that we do not return to the bad old days of the cost-plus system.
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para38"></a>Can the Minister tell us about the time frame? When do the Government expect to hear from the European Commission? Is that a matter of weeks or of months?
<P>

<a name="20627-03_para39"></a>This has been a sorry tale. The Government had five years in which to solve the problems of Railtrack. I do not deny that it had problems; I do not deny that we did not get it 100 per cent right.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-04_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   But we did not get it that wrong. After all, since privatisation&#151;the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, would do well to listen to this&#151;rail travel, the number of passengers using the network, rose by 30 per cent. In spite of the terrible disasters, rail travel is now safer and the train operating companies have invested hundreds of millions of pounds in new rolling stock.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para0"></a>As I said, this has been a sorry saga. Sadly, as always, the victims have been the travelling public.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for coming to the House to repeat the Statement. I place on record the support of those of us on these Benches for the start of a process that will move Railtrack out of administration and will place the railway infrastructure on a more sound and sustainable footing for the future.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para1"></a>Of course we believe that the public interest company is exactly the right way forward. Indeed, it would be extraordinary if we were to say anything else, because it was my honourable friend in another place who first suggested the idea of a public interest company as far back as last February. Almost a year ago to the day, the then Secretary of State commented that our proposals would introduce paralysis to the system. So I should be interested to hear what, apart from my honourable friend's oratory, persuaded the Government that a public interest company was the way forward.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para2"></a>We on these Benches have always taken the view that the interest of the travelling public must come first&#151;that and recognising the importance of an efficiently functioning railway network for the economy of the whole country, but especially for London and the South East.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para3"></a>Railtrack shareholders who originally bought shares obtained them at bargain-basement prices estimated as undervalued by about £6 billion. Between May 1996 and entering receivership, shareholders received about £700 million in dividends. So we agreed with the Secretary of State when he said last October:
<P>

<a name="column_1514"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1514</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Why has that changed? Also, what will happen if at their extraordinary general meeting the shareholders decide not to accept the offer?
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para5"></a>When the Government put Railtrack into administration, they said that they were not prepared to underwrite the company indefinitely or to offer a blank cheque. But we have heard today that they will underwrite it to the tune of £4 billion, but use a sleight of hand that filters the money through the Strategic Rail Authority. I join the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, in asking how that will be publicly scrutinised, especially by Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para6"></a>Privatisation occurred against a backdrop of an industry in decline. The industry was never set up to manage the kind of growth in passenger numbers already referred to. It is an often untold success story that 30 per cent more people than previously are using the railways. The new, improved SRA has been a major step forward and it is clear that the players in the industry are willing and able to work together now in a way that they have not been previously. That was clearly demonstrated in the way that the industry responded to the terrible events at Potters Bar.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para7"></a>But there are some difficult decisions to be made. Managing the balance of access to the track to grow the market and to maintain and enhance the network will need a clarity of purpose and a willingness to work together that we have not yet seen. Network Rail will be a key player in providing that. There is no merit in simply rebranding. The lessons of Consignia must loom large in our thinking. Clearly, removal of the profit element will remove one major difficulty that bedevilled Railtrack, but it is not the only one. How can the Government be so sure that Network Rail will not suffer the same management problems as Railtrack? How will the relationship between its operational board and its rainbow coalition of members brought together from the industry work in practice?
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para8"></a>Finally, how does Network Rail know exactly what it is taking on? There is still no asset register, despite the work under way while Railtrack has been in administration, and Network Rail has said that it will take it another 18 months to provide such a register. Against that background, how can Network Rail be sure how much money it will need to invest?
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para9"></a>It has been a difficult time for the industry, the passengers and the people who work for and own shares in Railtrack. Administration has been costly, costing about £1 million a day. It has led to a decrease in consumer and investor confidence. Let us hope that today's announcement marks a new chapter in the future of the railways.

<A NAME="20627-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, in reply to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, yes, I have ministerial responsibility for answering Questions in the House on transport matters. I shall be ably assisted in that by my estimable and noble friend Lord McIntosh.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para10"></a>The noble Viscount suggested that Railtrack was not in an extremely difficult position. He said that it was not insolvent. When Railtrack came to the <P>


<a name="column_1515"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1515</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government, it asked for what was virtually a blank cheque, for the suspension of the regulatory regime for several years and for the Government to support its share price during that period. I am sad to say that it became increasingly clear that the company was not in proper control either of its asset base or of its costs. That was why the Government took the action that they did and created the not-for-dividend public interest company about which the noble Viscount inquired.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para11"></a>The noble Viscount asked whether there were models for the public interest company. It is certainly the first rail network operator to be based on the model of a public interest company limited by guarantee, but such structures have been tried and tested at corporate level. I shall venture the example of BUPA, the successful private healthcare insurance company. It is, perhaps, the best known company limited by guarantee in the UK. There is also the more recently established Glas Cymru water company, which recently announced impressive preliminary results for the past financial year. In creating the company, we will, as the noble Baroness said, see money that might have gone to shareholders&#151;as, understandably, hundreds of millions of pounds have done&#151;reinvested in the railway.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para12"></a>The company will be limited by guarantee. The noble Viscount asked about auditing. The company will be consolidated into the accounts of the SRA. The auditors for Railtrack will continue to audit the new company, until the opportunity arises for the board to make decisions about any changes, as any company would do. The letter of comfort from the Secretary of State would not be a guarantee, as the noble Viscount will be aware. A Secretary of State could not fetter his discretion on such matters, but I am pleased to report that the evidence from the financial markets suggests that the company has been able to put in place financial arrangements that will assure the £9 billion that I mentioned.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para13"></a>As I said, there will be between 100 and 120 members of the company. The membership will be appointed by an independent appointments committee set up by the board inherited from the present structure of Network Rail. That board will include an appointee from the Strategic Rail Authority and will run the company along the expected lines. There will be representatives not just of those active in the industry&#151;the train operating companies, the freight operating companies and many other interests&#151;but of the public in the regions of the United Kingdom and other interest groups.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para14"></a>The noble Viscount inquired about the special purpose vehicle. Discussions are going on between the Strategic Rail Authority and Network Rail. We believe that understandings will be put in place on how the larger projects will be taken forward.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para15"></a>The SRA's accounts, into which Network Rail's accounts will be consolidated, will be laid before Parliament. They will show transparently how Network Rail is accounted for through the SRA. That is one of the advantages of the new structure. Network <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Rail is a private company, but it will follow the SRA's strategic plan, which is itself subject to parliamentary scrutiny. With regard to the European Commission's time-frame, we hope that decisions can be made in the near future&#151;in the next month or two. We go forward confidently with that.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para16"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, for the general welcome that she gave to the plans announced today. That welcome was, I think, amplified in notices that have been issued by the Office of the Rail Regulator, the Railway Forum and, as one would anticipate, the Strategic Rail Authority. I am delighted that there has been such a positive reaction. It is a great credit to those working in the industry that there has not been the kind of paralysis that one might have feared, had events developed in another fashion. We have done our best, with the help of the industry, to manage through the crisis.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para17"></a>The noble Baroness asked about compensation. I must make it clear that the moneys being offered to Railtrack are designed to encourage early exit, because of the benefits that the public would gain from an early decision. That is why the Government have put in our moneys alongside those of Network Rail. It is not compensation for shareholders; it is a recognition that the earlier the exit can be, the more financial advantage there will be to the public and the public purse. I anticipate confidently that the shareholders will look to the board for guidance. The guidance from the board will be that the offer is in the best interests of the shareholders.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para18"></a>I do not accept that the underwriting of the company represents any kind of sleight of hand. The £4 billion that we are seeing the SRA put in place will, in fact, be a form of quasi equity. Because the company will be a not-for-dividend company of the public interest model, it is important that it should have the resilience to be able to borrow. The £4 billion will be long stop money.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para19"></a>The noble Baroness asked why we thought that Network Rail would not have the same management problems. For one thing, the membership is representative of all railway interests. It has been made clear by the train operating companies&#151;in many ways, the most important of those interests&#151;and others that they want a company with well founded experience of engineering practice. So the emphasis will be on building a company that is capable of maintaining, operating and renewing such a vast network. It must also be a company whose management's interests are closely aligned with the targets set on the public's behalf by the SRA. Its management will, transparently, be under scrutiny inside a company that includes 120 or so representatives of the public interest.
<P>

<a name="20627-04_para20"></a>The noble Baroness is right to point to the continuing problems with the company. The asset register is not complete. That is one of the saddest aspects of the whole affair since privatisation, which clearly was rather ill founded inasmuch as a price was put on assets that were never properly quantified. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Despite the recent efforts of the SRA and of Railtrack itself, we are still short of all the information that we need. That is why we have put in the financial support for the company in such strong measure.

<A NAME="20627-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord made the point that there is an implied guarantee here, as there must be at the end of the day by any government. However, I cannot help wondering why he is so optimistic about this one. Every financial restructuring of British Rail and similar railways around the world has always been under-estimated. As  he rightly said, no government can place responsibilities upon their successor. All have finished up with the same conclusion&#151;massive debts&#151;and the only way of dealing with it by different governments has always been by cutting the investment programme. It is not like BUPA and I wonder why the noble Lord is so optimistic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I listen with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, given his long experience in industry, government and in particular the transport field. I accept the cautions that he states. Indeed, there were these recurring crises during the period when the railways were nationalised.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para0"></a>However, I do not accept that that is an inevitable cycle. I believe that with the structures we have put in place we probably have the enlightened self-interests around the board table of a kind which may not have been in place previously. I believe, too, based on the profound experience of decades of running a nationalised industry, but now, too, from the rather sad experience of the past six years of a privatised Railtrack, that there are lessons to be learned. If there is a criticism that I will readily accept, it is that we continued to be supportive of Railtrack perhaps beyond the point that it was cautious so to do. But we felt that we had to do everything in our power to make the system work and to give the management our support. Clearly, we came to this conclusion with some reluctance and sadness. However, having done so we decided to try to analyse and invest in full measure.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para1"></a>In terms of analysis, the noble Lord may concede that there is probably more of that now than in the past. The quality of it may be debated but we have analysed the problems very thoroughly. We have tried to create the framework for investment. We have now put in place short-term funding of around £10 billion. There will be about £7 billion for the so-called legacy problems inherited from Railtrack. As I said earlier, there will be the long-term support of the quasi-equity £4 billion which will persist over perhaps 50 years. Much of that is contingent liability. I would not expect much of it to be called. There will be a cap on the borrowings. But I believe that we now have a better sense of the scope of the problem and the moneys and policies in place to deal with it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the principal reason that this is <P>


<a name="column_1518"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1518</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>such an important and welcome Statement is because it is a very valuable step towards undoing the damage of the fragmentation of the railway caused since privatisation? Like the noble Lord, I wish that the step had been taken earlier, but the fact that it has been taken is extremely welcome today.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para2"></a>I endorse the point made by the noble Baroness about the way in which the industry is at last getting its act together. It demonstrated that after the Potters Bar accident. The welcome for the Statement from the rail regulator, the Strategic Rail Authority, the Railway Forum, passenger interest and others shows that there is broad support for the way in which the Government are now tackling this matter.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para3"></a>I ask specifically about the future of Mr John Armitt who addressed the all-party railways group earlier this week and impressed all the members of that group. Under his stewardship the number of delays attributed to Railtrack has now fallen from 50 per cent to 25 per cent and the record of signals passed at danger is now at its lowest level ever. I very much hope that Mr Armitt will be part of the future of the railway. I hope that my noble friend can give me some comfort on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I think that we would all agree, including noble Lords on the other side of the House, that there were defects in the way in which the railway industry was privatised. The conspicuous fragmentation of the industry would be one of the areas that we would hope the new structures would address. That would be true in the area of contracting and subcontracting to which Lord Cullen has drawn particular attention and on which I am sure the new management will begin to take action to remedy.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para4"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, I was heartened by the way the industry pulled together after the tragic events at Potters Bar. I think, too, that the leadership shown by John Armitt in the short time he has been there will surely commend him to the new company if he is minded to stay with it. John Armitt comes with an engineering background of the kind I emphasised is so desirable and in need of strengthening inside Network Rail.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para5"></a>Like the noble Lord, I look at all the problems and sigh for all the difficulties and tragedies we have had in recent years. However, although bearing in mind the noble Lord's cautions, we now go ahead with cautious optimism.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister amplify his reference to the European Union? In particular, will he give an assurance that no European taxpayer outside this country will be required to help to contribute towards the losses incurred entirely in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, we have money in Railtrack at present from the European Investment Bank. But we have notified the European Commission on 31st May of the proposed package of financial support for Network Rail. We are simply <P>


<a name="column_1519"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>now seeking confirmation that that package is compatible with the Treaty of Rome. We have every confidence that it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, since this is not a company answerable to its shareholders, can the Minister be a little more explicit about the role and composition of the members to whom, presumably, the board is accountable? Can he say how the interests between the rail users and the operating rail companies are to be reflected in the membership? What guidelines are being given to this independent group which is to choose the members so that we can judge the extent to which normal corporate governance requirements are being satisfied? Will it be decided that there will be independent auditing within the new company? Will there be, for example, remuneration committees which will have the job of reporting on those kinds of issues as well? It seems a somewhat circuitous process with the board nominating the members nominating the governing board. We need to know a good deal more about the rules which will be applied.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, to restate, I understand that there will be between 100 and 120 members. There will be a board of the company which will transfer from Network Rail as presently constituted but will in time be populated by people who are nominated by the members. The Strategic Rail Authority will be guaranteed membership on that board and may well have special powers inside the articles of association. No doubt the details of the relationship still have to be worked out.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para6"></a>The sale and purchase agreement has only just been signed so it is still early days. The thinking is that train operating companies, freight operating companies or contracting companies&#151;a range of private sector interests in the railway industry&#151;will be represented. We would also look to other outside bodies: in particular to the Scottish Parliament, to the Welsh Assembly, the regional interests in England and the passenger interests. I am not able to give the noble Lord a quick run through of what the articles of association might say, but I believe that the structure will be more accountable, more representative and more transparent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that many noble Lords strongly support this method of drawing a line under the present position for two reasons? First, the solution is robust; and, secondly, it is important that we return to a credible medium-term investment strategy for the industry.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para7"></a>Perhaps I may pick up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton. Does my noble friend agree that essentially the European Investment Bank is a facilitator, a financial intermediary, for private sector investment in the international bond market, and that Britain, far from receiving a subsidy, does not receive its normal proportionate share of such international money? I believe that it is right to say that we receive less as a proportion of the EIB's investments, and have done over many years, than France, Germany, Italy or <P>


<a name="column_1520"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1520</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>even Spain. A big challenge is spelt out in paragraph 20 of the Statement on the 10-year plan: £4.6 billion a year, which is £46 billion. Does my noble friend confirm that that is a challenge that has been taken up by the Government. The Statement says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government will, through the 10 Year Plan, increase the average annual investment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-05_para8"></a>
But that must be in co-operation with fund managers&#151;in other words the City of London. Do the Government intend to avoid the position in which the City of London sits on the sidelines with power without responsibility? Do they also recognise that, if we are in this together, there must be understanding of the way in which the medium-term plan, with the £46 billion, is put forward so that it is recognised by the international and national financial community as a viable, credible, medium-term plan?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I defer to my noble friend Lord Lea in his knowledge of matters European. I have listened with great interest to the points that he makes about the European Investment Bank. On the general finances, I believe that the most encouraging aspect of this development is the positive response that we have received from the financial markets. I also believe that the 10-year plan remains a positive framework inside which investors can make their judgments. The willingness of the financial community to come forward to support Network Rail in the first tranche of money that has been raised, must give us encouragement for the future. We still have quite a way to go. We await the extraordinary general meeting at which, I trust, the shareholders will want to approve the sale and purchase agreement and the deals that have been put before them.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para9"></a>As the noble Viscount suggested earlier, there is still some way to go before we can see how to take forward the special purpose vehicle. That discussion will have to take place between the SRA and Network Rail management. When I previously had responsibility for transport, there appeared to be a great enthusiasm in the City of London to work alongside us on the large levels of investment that we have assumed under the 10-year plan. I hope that, once the markets have had an opportunity to digest what is on offer and in prospect today, they will continue to take a positive approach.

<A NAME="20627-05_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My Lords, all noble Lords wish Network Rail well in undertaking the refurbishment of the infrastructure of the UK's railways. A number of issues have yet to be answered. The Minister drew attention to the fact that the fragmentation of the railways would be reduced by the introduction of the Network Rail structure. How is that so? One network operator, Railtrack, is being replaced by another network operator, Network Rail. Surely, by itself that announcement will not produce any reduction in fragmentation of the railways. Network Rail may well pursue different policies in the future in conjunction with the SRA. The fact that there is a new network operator makes no difference to the number of <P>


<a name="column_1521"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>companies. Indeed, we have heard that major projects will be undertaken by the use of special purpose vehicles, which means more corporate entities and not fewer&#151;so more fragmentation not less.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para10"></a>On corporate governance, I thought that the Minister said that the board would have a role in appointing a committee that, in turn, would appoint the members who, in turn, would exercise corporate governance over the board. That appears to be a rather circular structure. At a time when corporate governance is increasingly under the spotlight, particularly in the United States, surely great emphasis should be placed on reassuring investors, or those bodies that are to provide finance to Network Rail through debt, that proper corporate governance procedures are in place.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para11"></a>Thirdly, on whether or not Network Rail is a public company, I did not understand the Minister's argument about BUPA. Unlike BUPA, this body is the Government's own creation. It will undertake the Government's transport policy through the SRA and indeed it is underwritten by the Government. Why does that not make it a public company? The noble Lord drew comfort from the fact that the £4 billion underwritten by the SRA is quasi equity. Equity means ownership, so that implies that the SRA owns this company or at least a proportion of it. The SRA is a vehicle of the Government, so it must be a government company.
<P>

<a name="20627-05_para12"></a>Perhaps the Minister will say why the Government are being so coy about public ownership of this body. If it were a public company, the Government would have fully nationalised Railtrack, and I understand that that word holds some powerful connotations for the Government. Had they nationalised it, they would have been able to borrow on the gilt market, the cheapest possible form of borrowing, to refurbish our rail infrastructure. I should be grateful if the Minister could give the cost difference between the Government borrowing the money straight on the gilt market in the conventional way and the new body borrowing money commercially. If he cannot answer that now, perhaps he could provide me with that information at a later date.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, on fragmentation, the particular area of concern highlighted by Lord Cullen was that of the contractors and subcontractors. Across the industry I believe that it is now understood that there can be a degree of consolidation in the contracting regimes. Indeed, Railtrack had embarked on that course some time ago. I anticipate consolidation there. It is also possible that, following some previous declarations, the franchising process pursued by the Strategic Rail Authority would lead to a kind of consolidation and less fragmentation in train operation. I believe that the fragmentation can be reduced, but more importantly we need strong management and strong co-operation across the industry of the kind that has emerged in recent months.

<a name="20627-06_para0"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, asked about the board committee. The company will be accountable to its members, but of course it will be accountable also to the independent regulator. It will have a network licence requiring it to be operated as though it were a stand-alone limited company. The board will eventually be elected by its members, although as I said, the Strategic Rail Authority will have membership of the board and retain special rights. The appointments committee will be independent and make its judgments independently when appointing the 100 to 120 members of the company. But it is difficult for me to describe in detail to your Lordships the articles of association of this nascent company.

My noble friend Lord McCarthy regrets that he is unable to be present as he is presiding at an arbitration case.

<a name="20627-06_para12"></a>I return to the matter of preparation payments as provided for in Clause 22(2).

<P>

<a name="20627-06_para13"></a>The amendment was drafted by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. To put it simply, we believe that the possibility of facing heavy expenses if the case is lost intimidates a number of would-be employment tribunal claimants, including those who may have a well-founded case. Evidence exists&#151;to which we referred earlier&#151;provided by NACAB, among others, that solicitors acting for employers already attempt to intimidate claimants by threatening that there will be large, probably unaffordable costs, should the claim fail.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para14"></a>If an employer is able to claim preparation expenses, which could be high, that could act as another obstacle to a would-be claimant. The Law Society has pointed out that the position of the parties is hardly equal. The claimant may prepare his case in the evenings on his kitchen table. It may be an onerous task, as the Minister has said, but not one likely to involve the kind of expenses an employer could claim. He could claim for the time of his senior directors, the members of his personnel department, administrative and specialist staff, and overtime pay.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para15"></a>It is to be noted that Judge John Prophet, president of the employment tribunals, has on a number of occasions voiced concern about this provision in the Bill. It will be recalled that on Report I followed his recommendation and tabled an amendment based on applying the Litigants in Person (Costs and Expenses) Act 1975. The Government did not find that acceptable. Indeed, when the Minister was asked if the Government intended Clause 22(2) to apply to directors, managers and employees dealing with the matter in the normal course of their duties, his response was that where companies are represented and incur costs, they can claim such expenses under costs.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para16"></a>Judge Prophet has pointed out in correspondence I have recently seen that that is misleading since costs can be awarded only where there is legal representation. The question remains as to whether companies will be able to claim preparation time for directors, managers and employees who are attending to cases as part of their normal paid duties or who are provided with paid advice by outside advisers or consultants.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para17"></a>The amendment strives for some equality between the parties. Obviously, the employer could make a much greater claim than the claimant for preparation time and expenses if the Bill remains unamended. My noble friends and I have been concerned about the issue, which is why we are raising it this final time at Third Reading, particularly as the president of the employment tribunals still shares our view. I hope for a favourable response from the Minister. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in response to points made by noble friend Lady Turner and other noble Lords in Grand Committee, we tabled on Report an amendment to provide that a tribunal may not make an award for both costs and preparation time. That is a significant amendment that meets the key concern about the effects of the new provision for preparation time.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para18"></a>This amendment seeks to go yet further. Its first part seeks to exclude an award of preparation time in respect of work on the tribunal case which is within the normal duties of an employer or its employees and contractors. The amendment's effect would be to exclude employers almost entirely from preparation time awards. I understand that it is aimed at companies that employ staff to deal with personnel matters, but it could be argued that it would be within the normal duties of the manager of a small newsagent, for example, who pays the wages and hires and fires <P>


<a name="column_1525"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>staff to deal with tribunal applications. However, our disagreement with the amendment is more fundamental than the way it is worded.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para19"></a>Employers have to accept that in running a business they may at some point become involved in a tribunal complaint, and even if that complaint is not upheld by the tribunal they must bear the costs of defending the case, because to have a system of loser pays the winner's costs could have a serious detrimental effect on applicants in particular. That is part and parcel of running a business or company. But why should employers be expected, as a matter of course, to bear the costs and disruption of defending complaints which have been brought or conducted vexatiously or which had no reasonable hope of ever succeeding?
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para20"></a>Preparation time awards will be awarded only in very limited circumstances&#151;hopeless, vexatious, unreasonable cases. Those cases are exceptional and we do not accept that defending them should be considered part of the normal execution of duties.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para21"></a>The second part of the amendment proposes that preparation time payments should not include work done by legal advisers, including in-house legal advisers. Although we are aware that the power in new Section 13A(1) could conceivably cover time spent on a case by anyone, including outside lawyers, Sections 13 and 13A are clearly drafted on the basis that preparation time awards and costs awards will cover different matters; in particular, there is a prohibition on a tribunal making both kinds of awards to a party, as I have already pointed out.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para22"></a>We consider that the appropriate place for the detail on how preparation time awards are to be assessed is in the regulations. When we draw up and consult on the regulations, we will consider how best to give full effect to the prohibition on receiving both a costs award and a preparation time award. We intend that assessment of preparation time awards will be by reference to matters which are not recoverable in costs awards.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para23"></a>I understand that these amendments are motivated by concern that applicants may be deterred from bringing cases or may suffer disproportionately as a result of preparation time. Given what I have said about the exceptional nature of preparation time awards, I do not believe that they will. We know that tribunals use their costs powers with great care, but my noble friend Lady Turner and other noble Lords have raised concerns about the impact of Clause 22 and we have acted on them.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para24"></a>We brought forward on Report an amendment to provide that a party may claim costs or preparation time, but not both. We have just restored in Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 the tribunal's discretion to take into account a party's ability to pay when determining whether to award costs or to set the level of costs, and we have included preparation time.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para25"></a>We have said that we will set out in regulations guidelines on how preparation time should be calculated to ensure that awards are reasonable and proportionate to the case. We shall consult very carefully with the tribunal judiciary to establish what <P>


<a name="column_1526"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guidelines they will find helpful and not over-prescriptive. In addition, tribunals will have the discretion to determine what is reasonable in each case. We have said that we will include consideration of a cap on preparation time or fixed amounts for elements of the award.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para26"></a>In addition, we have given an undertaking to address intimidation by representatives through better guidance on how the costs regime operates, to make it clear that the circumstances under which costs can be awarded are very limited.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para27"></a>I think that we have demonstrated our willingness to address the points of concern raised my noble friends Lady Turner, Lord Wedderburn and Lord McCarthy about the impact of costs and preparation time on applicants. The integrity and efficiency of the tribunal system relies upon a costs regime which is both fair and effective. I believe that that will be achieved through the Bill and the supporting regulations. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.

<A NAME="20627-06_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend on the Front Bench for that response. It is quite true that the Government have moved on the whole issue of preparation time since we first raised it. The reason why we have been so keen to advance the case for it once again at Third Reading is that we have striven to achieve what we perceive as a measure of equality between the parties. We felt that preparation time would be more likely to involve the employer in being able to claim a large payment rather than the employee.
<P>

<a name="20627-06_para28"></a>However, I am gratified to learn that regulations are to be drafted which seem to take on board many of the points that have been made in the course of our debates. Furthermore, the employment tribunals will then have that guidance on which to base their decisions. In the circumstances, therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20627-07_para6"></a>On Report, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn proposed an amendment which would have had the effect of restricting striking out at a pre-hearing review to the circumstances set out in rules 4, 7 and 15 of the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2001. I undertook to see whether we could table an amendment to Clause 28 at Third Reading which would encapsulate the spirit of my noble friend's amendment.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para7"></a>I believe that the amendment will do so by providing that a tribunal may not strike out at a pre-hearing review on a ground which does not apply outside such a review. The grounds for striking out proceedings under the 2001 regulations are contained in rules 4, 7 and 15, and include failure to comply with an order or direction imposed by the tribunal or when the originating application or notice of appearance&#151;or anything in it&#151;is scandalous, misconceived or vexatious. The amendment does not specifically mention the rules, not least because future revisions may lead to renumbering.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para8"></a>As I said on Report, we have no intention of widening the grounds in the regulations on which tribunals may currently strike claims out, although we may consult on whether to amend rule 4 of the procedure rules to take into account the new powers that the presidents will have to issue practice directions, so that tribunals could strike out cases for serious failure to comply with them. The only change resulting from this clause will be that it may be possible to strike out at the pre-hearing review stage. This amendment will ensure that the grounds for striking out may not be wider than those applicable at other stages. I beg to move.

These are minor but necessary technical amendments to Clause 37 which will allow employers to use a letter of engagement or a contract of employment to satisfy the requirement to provide employees with a written statement of employment particulars.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para16"></a>A written statement must give a date by reference to which it operates. Logically, any alternative document fulfilling the function of a written statement must also give such a date. The current text of Clause 37 refers to,

However, there may be uncertainty about the date of any particular contract of employment.

 "POWER TO CONFER RIGHTS ON INDIVIDUALS: AMENDMENT
<br>
 In section 23(5) of the Employment Relations Act 1999 (c. 26) (power to confer rights on individuals), the words "or otherwise" are omitted."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-07_para27"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I regret having to table this amendment a third time. I say that not by way of an apology but to explain that I was compelled to do so by the Government's obdurate refusal to accept the deletion of two words from the Employment Relations Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para28"></a>The amendment's positioning has changed. Originally it related to Schedule 7, which deals with minor and consequential amendments. The Minister is always polite across the Dispatch Box but when dealing with this amendment the noble Lord was patronising towards me. He said once that the amendment started with a bang and ended with a <P>


<a name="column_1529"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whimper. On another occasion, he gave numerous examples involving someone named Doreen. I would not mind except that, unusually for me, I doubted myself and wondered whether I had got it wrong. I sought the opinion of the eminent and learned noble Lords, Lord Ackner and Lord Brightman. They told me that this was not a minor matter and that the amendment was important but needed to be somewhere else&#151;so I changed its position.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para29"></a>This wholly harmless amendment would delete what I originally believed to be tautology but the Government's obstinacy, coupled with the Minister's specious and meaningless arguments, convinces me that there is something more to it and that we must get rid of those unnecessary words.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para30"></a>Section 23 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 gives the Secretary of State the power to confer certain rights on individuals. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An order under this section may make provision in such way as the Secretary of State thinks fit, whether by amending Acts or instruments or otherwise".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para31"></a>
I will return to the words
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such way as the Secretary of State thinks fit"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para32"></a>
but "or otherwise" must be removed.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para33"></a>On 4th December 2001, I asked the Minister what those words meant. He frankly admitted that he did not know. He subsequently wrote to me:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The use of 'or otherwise' was intended to ensure that an order under section 23 could also apply to rights to individuals by means of a free-standing provision rather than by an amendment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para34"></a>
The words
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"rather than by an amendment"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para35"></a>
mean that the Government admit that "or otherwise" is in addition to an Act or a statutory instrument. What is a "free-standing provision"? My advisers and I scoured the text books but were unable to find any reference to a constitutional device named a free-standing provision. It is abundantly clear that the Government are trying to introduce a new device that will enable them to circumvent Parliament by use of a Ministerial decree.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para36"></a>My advisers and I looked for a similar provision elsewhere but could find none. Some time ago, I asked the Library: it was unable to find anything similar. Only today I received a letter from the senior Library clerk:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have searched the Lexis database of the statutes but have not found any further examples of the phraseology used in section 23(5) of the Employment Relations Act 1999".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para37"></a>
In previous debates, I have repeatedly asked the Minister to explain "a free-standing provision" but all he wrote was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"this was simply a way to give the Secretary of State the flexibility to extend rights . . . in a way that seemed best from a drafting point of view".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para38"></a>
He repeated the flexibility argument in all the debates but did not explain how the "or otherwise" powers would be exercised&#151;despite my suggesting fanciful ways, such as press advertisements or handing out leaflets in Whitehall.
<P>


<a name="column_1530"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1530</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para39"></a>On Report, the Minister admitted that the wording
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"enables an order made under Section 23 to extend rights to individuals by means of a free-standing provision"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para40"></a>
again that meaningless phrase&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in an instrument . . . rather than by an amendment to existing primary or secondary legislation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para41"></a><P>

<a name="20627-07_para42"></a>What kind of instrument? I know only of statutory instruments. That comment confirms my suspicions about a ministerial decree. Fortunately, we have not yet reached the stage of allowing ourselves to be governed that way. The Minister also said on Report:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is merely a question of how an order under Section 23 is drafted".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para43"></a>
Not so. The Minister admitted that "or otherwise" is an addition to the power to make a statutory instrument. The plain meaning of the words also make that absolutely clear. The Minister said that the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"do not mean that the Secretary of State can . . . extend rights without making an order".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para44"></a>
If that is so, what is the "or otherwise" process? The Minister claimed also that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an affirmative order is required, as is stated in the legislation".".&#151;[Official Report, 18/6/2002; cols. 702-703.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para45"></a><P>

<a name="20627-07_para46"></a>On the contrary. Section 23(5) provides for rights to be altered in three ways&#151;a new Act of Parliament; an instrument, which I readily agree requires parliamentary sanction; "or otherwise", for which there is no qualification or precedent.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para47"></a>As to the Minister's claim that the Secretary of State cannot extend rights without making an order, I remind your Lordships that Section 23(5) of the 1999 Act commences:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An order under this section may make provision in such a way as the Secretary of State thinks fit".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para48"></a>
I ask the Minister to convince me and your Lordships&#151;so far, he has dismally failed&#151;by explaining how that power would be exercised, if not by a new Act or instrument.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para49"></a>The Minister insists on treating the issue as trivial. In Committee he called it a "whimper." On Report, he condescendingly said that he would make a final attempt to explain the point to me. The Minister has totally missed the point. At the risk of continuing to bore the noble Lord, I tell him that the power to alter people's rights is not in issue but how those alterations should be made.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para50"></a>An Act of Parliament would be unobjectionable, as would a statutory instrument but "or otherwise"&#151;importing as it does anything that the Secretary of State thinks fit&#151;is not acceptable. It is a dangerous precedent that, despite the Minister's protestations, introduces the possibility of the Government by-passing Parliament. That provision should be removed. To quote the Minister, it is really quite simple. I beg to move.

<a name="column_1531"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1531</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister said; it is an important issue that gives rise to the question why on earth the words "or otherwise" were used. They must serve some purpose.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para51"></a>What does the phrase "free-standing" mean? I have heard of free range and of free-standing in relation to the law on fixtures and fittings but what does it mean here? The Minister has never indicated. Perhaps it means free-standing in the sense that the Minister or Government can operate by decree&#151;for example, by placing a notice in The Times saying that as from the first of the month the following will be affected by the Act. There is nothing to stop that being done.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para52"></a>The Minister said that the affirmative resolution procedure would apply to anything done under "or otherwise". But, if one looks at the Act, that opinion is very difficult to sustain because Clause 50 on page 58 deals solely with orders and regulations.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para53"></a>Clause 50(2) provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any power of the Secretary of State to make orders or regulations under this Act is exercisable by statutory instrument",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-07_para54"></a>
and it goes on to state that the affirmative procedure must be adhered to. But that is in regard to orders or regulations. We are not concerned with that, otherwise there would be no need to put the offending words in.
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para55"></a>There is a very heavy onus on a government that have expressly taken power to make alterations in the only ways provided for&#151;that is, by amending an Act of Parliament or by secondary legislation&#151;to justify the addition of "or otherwise". I suggest that this is either a draftsman's aberration or, alternatively, that the Government want to ensure that they have every conceivable power to do what they wish. In the debate on Report, the Minister said in terms, "This does not give us any greater power". One then asks "Well, why have it? What are the words designed to do? To what are they directed?".
<P>

<a name="20627-07_para56"></a>This raises an important matter. I rely on the views of my noble and learned friend Lord Brightman, whose wisdom on drafting knows no equal in this House or perhaps anywhere else. He said that this amendment is important and should be put appropriately in the Bill and not in Schedule 7. I hope that the Minister understands that this is not a small technical matter on which to patronise the noble Baroness. It raises an important, fundamental matter. It is for the Minister to justify what, on the face of it, looks like unlimited power.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   My Lords, in supporting the amendment I intend to take a practical approach to the problem. I imagine myself as a judge faced with a case involving Section 23(5) of the 1999 Act. I read Section 25 and I learn that the Secretary of State has power to make an order granting specified rights to specified individuals in certain circumstances. I am told by the Section that the order may be made,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such a way as the Secretary of State thinks fit, whether by amending Acts or instruments or otherwise".

<a name="column_1532"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1532</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para1"></a>So the Secretary of State has three options: he may use an amending Act; he may use a statutory instrument; or he may make the order "otherwise"&#151;that is, in some other unspecified way. I shall assume in my imaginary case that the Secretary of State decides not to make the order by primary or secondary legislation but by an advertisement in The Times. My job as the judge in the imaginary case before me will be to decide whether an advertisement in The Times is enough.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para2"></a>A decision on that point will immediately confront me with the task of deciding what "or otherwise" means. I cannot avoid that responsibility. I must decide what "or otherwise" means. As a judge, I must try to reach a sensible decision, a sensible conclusion. The only sensible conclusion that I can think of is that "or otherwise" means "or some other reasonable means". I decide the case before me on that basis, hoping that I shall not be rapped over the knuckles by an appellate court.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para3"></a>The question now arises whether your Lordships are satisfied with an enactment which is so drafted that it is left to the discretion of the Secretary of State to decide what is a reasonable vehicle to use in order to change the law. In my view, such an enactment imposes a quite unacceptable burden on the judiciary and a quite unacceptable inroad into the democratic procedures of this country and should be rejected by your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para4"></a>How is the judiciary to decide what are reasonable methods of changing the law other than the standard methods which are known to all of us? How is an employer to know whether the Secretary of State has made a valid order under the words "or otherwise"? How is the individual, who has purportedly had rights conferred on him by the Secretary of State, to know whether it is, after all, just an illusion because the Secretary of State has decided to use a device under Section 23 which some court decides is unreasonable?
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para5"></a>Is this a precedent which those of your Lordships who today sit on the Government Benches would like to see in the hands of the Opposition if they one day sit on those Benches and form another government? To put the matter shortly, the words "or otherwise" are two words too far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness indicated, we have debated this amendment on earlier occasions. I plead guilty to the fact that I did not think that this was a major issue. I apologise if I took it in a frivolous way. I have now looked at the matter in depth because clearly it is a matter of great concern to the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para6"></a>Let me try to explain the nature of the situation. Looking again at the points she has made, I hope that I have identified the reasons for her belief that the term gives new and objectionable powers to the Secretary of State to by-pass Parliament. I can see how subsection (5) of Section 23 of the Employment Rights Act could be read in a way to suggest that it confers novel powers.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para7"></a>However, it is still my view that it does no such thing. Section 23 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 empowers the Secretary of State to extend the <P>


<a name="column_1533"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1533</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>coverage of statutory employment protection rights by order, and not by any other means, to individuals not currently covered by them. Subsection (1) lists the legislation containing the rights in relation to which the power can be exercised. Subsection (5) permits the Secretary of State to make an affirmative order that extends any of the rights conferred by this legislation either by amending Acts and/or instruments or otherwise.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para8"></a>It is stated in Section 23(2) and again at the beginning of subsection (5) itself, that if the Secretary of State wishes to exercise the powers in this section to extend employment rights she can only do so by making an order. Section 23(2) states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by order make provision which has the effect of conferring any such right on individuals who are of a specified description".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-08_para9"></a>
I believe that the noble Baroness must be reading "or otherwise" as if those words overrode this requirement, so enabling the powers in the section to be used without parliamentary scrutiny. If that were the position, it would clearly be objectionable in the way the noble Baroness has indicated, but I hope that she will see that that is not the case. The phrase,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whether by amending Acts or instruments or otherwise"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-08_para10"></a>
in Section 23 sets out how the Secretary of State may make an order. It is not a list of the types of legislation she may use. It means in layman's terms, and terms which I can understand, whether by amending Acts or amending instruments, or by a new order that does neither of these things. It does not mean whether by amending Acts or by making instruments or by some other means.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para11"></a>The noble Baroness may say that it is ambiguous but, taken with the rest of Section 23, it clearly has the meaning which I have given it. Furthermore, any order under Section 23 must be affirmative. Section 42 of the 1999 Act states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no order or regulations shall be made under sections 3,17,19 or 23 unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, both Houses of Parliament".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-08_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20627-08_para13"></a>As I sought to explain in our earlier debates on this amendment, its meaning is simply that, when making an order under the section, the Secretary of State can include provisions in it that extend employment rights, but do not amend any Act or instrument in order to do so. That is all that is meant by using the words "freestanding" although I accept that my use of that expression seems to have been confusing rather than enlightening.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para14"></a>Perhaps I may also explain that this is not the only use of the words "or otherwise" in legislation. I give two other uses of those words in other legislation. The first is Section 116 of the Finance Act 1991. That relates to regulations which provide that a charge to stamp duty does not arise or is reduced in certain circumstances. Section 116 provides that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"regulations may make any provision in such way as the Treasury thinks fit (whether by amending enactments or otherwise)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-08_para15"></a><P>


<a name="column_1534"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1534</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Section 111 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 relates to changing the reference in legislation to rates or rateable value of property. Section 111 states that where there is a reference to rates or rateable value, regulations may provide that that reference shall instead by such as is prescribed
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such a way as the Secretary of State thinks fit, whether by amending enactments or otherwise".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-08_para16"></a>
So this is not a unique use of the phrase "or otherwise".
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para17"></a>Nevertheless, the noble and learned Lords, Lord Ackner and Lord Brightman, have made very strong statements that they believe that this is not appropriate. Therefore, we have to take account of that very strong advice. We have to decide whether to do something which the noble and learned Lords, with all their experience, believe to be wrong in the circumstances and to balance that against the ability to have an instrument which stands on its own and, in those circumstances, gives slightly greater freedom to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para18"></a>In view of the very strong pleas by both noble and learned Lords that they do not believe the Government's measure is appropriate, on balance we are prepared to accept the amendment.

The noble and learned Lords, Lord Ackner and Lord Brightman, are highly respected Members of this House. But it is my noble friend Lady Miller who brought this matter before the House and the two noble and learned Lords. It is highly and extremely ungracious of the Minister not to accept the work of my noble friend, which deserves some credit at this stage of Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, as the House will know, I have the very greatest respect for the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. She brought this point to the House and that was a very important thing. However, the point I was seeking to make, and which I stand by very clearly, is that we still believe that this is a perfectly proper situation, but given the very great experience of the two noble and learned Lords, we are prepared to accept the amendment. That is an appropriate way to make our decision although of course I accept that it was the noble Baroness who brought this matter to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for the gracious way in which he accepted my amendment.

<a name="20627-08_para20"></a>Clause 48 [Work-focused interviews for partners]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-08_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 56, line 19, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-08_para21"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) The purpose of the interview shall be to advise the partner of available opportunities for employment or training (or both).
<br>
( ) Reduction of benefit under this section shall not be applied should the partner deem the employment or training on offer to be unsuitable in the light of his training, background and general circumstances."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-08_para22"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the issue of work-focused interviews for the partners of claimants has been discussed both in Committee and at Report. I was not convinced by the arguments of the Front Bench on both occasions against the amendments that we put forward. We were advised by my noble friend Lady Hollis of Heigham, the Minister for Work and Pensions, who dealt with this issue for the Government at Report stage&#151;I am glad to welcome her to the Front Bench again today&#151;that the purpose of the provision in the Bill is entirely benign. The intention is to ensure that the partners of claimants are fully advised as to employment and training opportunities available. There will be no compulsion on them to accept the opportunities held out to them. The sanction of loss of benefit only applies to their failure to attend for interviews. She asked herself whether such interviews should be made compulsory. She answered that herself by saying that if they were voluntary people do not turn up. When people thought that interviews were compulsory and a condition of benefit, they then turned up.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para23"></a>I believe that there may be another reason why people do not turn up. They believe that going down "the Social", which is how some of them describe it, may involve them in accepting jobs that they do not want or feel are unsuitable for them. I made it clear on both occasions when I spoke on this clause that I do not like it at all. The noble Baroness did not persuade me that it was a good provision to appear in an Employment Bill. I share the view of the noble Lords who spoke and said that the clause is really more appropriate for a social security Bill because it is a social security matter rather than an employment one.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para24"></a>In response to my query as to why a claimant should lose benefit because her partner&#151;the claimant is often likely to be a woman&#151;will not go down to the office for interview, my noble friend said that the benefit being paid was a family benefit although the Bill does make specific reference to the benefit continuing to be payable to the claimant. But if it is a family benefit I do not believe that it makes much difference to my case. A family benefit, and a reduction to it, is normally likely to impact more on the woman in a couple than on the man. Why should she suffer simply because he will not attend for interview?
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para25"></a>Not all couples live in harmony. Many women stay with unsatisfactory partners for numerous reasons, as we all know. Out of sheer wilfulness, he may refuse to go for an interview. My amendment seeks to deal with one of the reasons why a partner may not be willing to go for interview. In her response at Report stage, the noble Baroness said that the sanction of benefit <P>


<a name="column_1536"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reduction only applies if partners do not respond to the requirement to go for interview. In other words, if employment is offered and refused, there will be no sanction. The sanction is lifted the moment the partner enters the office.
<P>

<a name="20627-08_para26"></a>My noble friend says that the intention is entirely benign. I am sure that, so far as she is concerned, that is absolutely right, and certainly while she and her colleagues are in office I am sure that we can expect the legislation to be applied in a compassionate and benign way. But there is nothing on the face of the Bill to say so, and future governments may interpret legislation entirely differently. There is a case therefore for writing this important provision on to the face of the Bill. I hope that the Government will be prepared to look with more favour on the proposed wording. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, this clause&#151;originally Clause 49, now Clause 48&#151;caused considerable aggravation and concern to Members on all sides of the House. I do not think that we ought to let pass the concerns expressed both on the Minister's side and from these Benches as to the effect of the provision.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para0"></a>I strongly support the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. If the Government are prepared to say that the question of sanction is removed as soon the individual to whom the provision applies has actually turned up for an interview, then a large number of the concerns expressed on all sides will be removed.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para1"></a>We all accept, as the Minister says, that such interviews are often very beneficial for those who take part in them. All the evidence produced by the Minister in Committee and on Report demonstrates that they are beneficial in getting back into the workplace people who might not otherwise find that possible. However, the concern on all sides relates to the next stage; namely, that if it turns out that the job is not appropriate and is not wanted by the individual, that person then loses benefit.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para2"></a>If the Minister indicates that the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, is right when she says that the potential loss of benefit should stop at the moment when the individual turns up for the work-related interview, many of our concerns will be removed. I should be grateful for that undertaking.

<A NAME="20627-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, on reading the amendment I was genuinely baffled. My noble friend has long-standing experience in social security. When I joined the House and we were in opposition, she guided me through many of the traps of social security legislation. Indeed, we were busy setting traps for the then government to fall into&#151;and occasionally we succeeded.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para3"></a>I am baffled because the amendment is narrower and less generous than what the Government intend and the second part of it seeks to avert that which cannot happen and is therefore redundant. I take it <P>


<a name="column_1537"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1537</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that my noble friend seeks assurances from me rather than a full slogging-out of the issues behind work-focused interviews.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para4"></a>The amendment seeks, first, to narrow the scope of the interview to a meeting about available employment and training opportunities; secondly, it seeks to avert a reduction in benefit where the partner deems the employment or training on offer to be unsuitable in the light of his or her training, background and general circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para5"></a>To take the first part of the amendment, the work-focused interview is designed to find out about the individual&#151;his or her level of skills and experience&#151;and to explore the broad range of information and support available to help them look for work should they wish to do so. The interview will also include advice about possible benefits, about best-buy packages, which our research shows are very important to lone parents trying to calculate whether they should or should not go into work. It possibly covers childcare issues and support services for a carer who would like to go into work for a short period but does not know what the resources are, and that applies to their partners as well. That is what the interview is for. It is not simply to discuss suitable jobs or training opportunities.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para6"></a>My noble friend's amendment would turn the interview into something much narrower and much more akin to the fortnightly intervention meeting&#151;the sign-on interview&#151; attended by those claiming JSA. My reading of the interview is more generous and more comprehensive than that. My noble friend is turning the interview into the very thing that she has criticised on previous occasions.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para7"></a>The second part of the amendment seeks to protect the benefit of the claimant and his or her partner from a reduction should the partner deem the available employment or the training on offer to be unsuitable. But as my noble friend recognises, no one will be required to accept available employment or training as a result of the interview. Regardless of whether or not it is available, all the partner has to do is to take part in the interview. If he or she does this, no question of a reduction in benefit arises. I am happy to give the assurances sought by the Liberal Democrat Benches that at the point someone comes in to be interviewed any question of sanction is then dropped. That will follow three efforts, including, if necessary, a home visit, but certainly personal contact to make sure that people understand the situation.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para8"></a>The push of my noble friend's amendment seems to be that a partner should be required to look for and consider suitable work or training and that, if it is available, it should be taken up; and that the only grounds on which the sanction should not apply is if the work or training is unsuitable. In that sense, the amendment goes far further that the Government think appropriate or sensible and is well beyond the scope of this provision. My noble friend seeks in the second part of the amendment to avert that which cannot happen.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para9"></a>I am profoundly surprised by my noble friend's amendment. If I were seeking to do what she seeks, she would surely deplore it. In the first part of the amendment, she is narrowing the supportive, wide-ranging interview effectively into a JSA sign-on, and in the second part she is assuming that people will be required to work when they will not. The first part is less generous; the second part is simply not relevant. I hope that with that response again on the record in Hansard my noble friend feels that she has the commitment that she was seeking and will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that response. In view of what she said, my hope is that when regulations are written in respect of the Bill, as I am sure they will be, or guidance is given, this will be made absolutely clear to the officials who are charged with responsibility for applying the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para10"></a>My noble friend is right. I was seeking confirmation of what she has just said; namely, that there will not be pressure on people to accept work or training, or indeed any other recommendations, and that the sanction will be applied only if they fail to show up for interview; and that the possibility of a sanction will disappear as soon as the partner goes through the door of the benefit office. In the light of that, I am willing to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend uses the phrase, "goes through the door of the benefit office". It is clear that we expect the person to engage in the interview in a sensible way, not just go through the door, come out again and say, "I've signed in". But with that qualification, so that there is no misunderstanding, my noble friend is right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, in view of that response, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-09_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 18. I have re-submitted these amendments because of the helpful way in which my noble friend the Minister responded to them on Report. He recognised the importance of the issue of bullying at work, about which many people are worried. As I said on Report, that was evident in the large number of people&#151;more than 90&#151;who attended a meeting in June at the House.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para15"></a>I know that the Government believe that there are problems with the definition of bullying at work but I recall that many years ago, when we first discussed racial and sexual issues involving harassment and <P>


<a name="column_1539"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discrimination, it was said then that the definition of those phrases would be the difficulty. I believe that the difficulty could be overcome.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para16"></a>I do not wish to go into the arguments that I put forward at previous stages of the Bill. I do not see the point of reiterating the remarks that I made on Report and at Second Reading, when I detailed what happened to those who are bullied. I pointed out the detrimental effect it has on them and often on their families and friends. That has been well documented, as have the effects of a culture and ethos of bullying at a workplace.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para17"></a>On Report, the Minister signalled that between Report and today more thought would be given to the issue of bullying. I look forward to hearing any new thinking on the matter. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend, who spoke to Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. We tabled the amendments to follow up the debate on Report on 11th June at cols. 173 to 178. The position was clarified when the Minister stated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Employees can raise allegations of bullying under grievance procedures",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-09_para18"></a>
and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"employers can use their disciplinary procedures against employees who are accused of bullying".&#151;[Official Report, 11/6/02; col. 176.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-09_para19"></a><P>

<a name="20627-09_para20"></a>For many of us, that clarification was a step forward. The question that now arises and which it would be very timely for the Minister to shed further light on, is how the matter will be made clear when the regulations are enacted. We are now at the stage of the Bill when our minds turn to the small print.
<P>

<a name="20627-09_para21"></a>How the House will be kept up to date on the enactment of the regulations is one thing but there is a wider audience on this issue. Everyone in the employment relationship will have a wider interest, including employers and trade unions, in how they will be familiarised with the implications of this Bill. The relationship between this legislation, these codes and other procedures is a good illustration of it and one which the Minister may wish to comment on. We have made quite a step forward if the Minister confirms that our understanding of this is correct.

<A NAME="20627-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, these are the same amendments that we saw on Report on the treatment of cases which involve bullying. They seek to allow the employer or manager to initiate an appeal against a step two decision under the standard statutory procedures for both dismissal and discipline and grievances in cases involving bullying. The current procedures only permit an employee to request an appeal.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para0"></a>I said on Report that I would meet my noble friends Lady Gibson and Lord Lea to discuss those concerns. We had that meeting this morning which I thought was very helpful and productive. We all agreed that bullying represents a major source of workplace stress and, in its extreme forms, can threaten the health of individuals. The solution I propose involves that point.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para1"></a>Most organisations are aware of this issue to some degree but a significant number have no policies to deal with it. These organisations need greater help and support. I am pleased to announce that as part of the Government's ongoing strategy to address workplace bullying, we intend to set up an advisory group to the Health and Safety Executive and the Department of Trade and Industry to advise on the establishment of a new management standard for anti-bullying policies in the workplace. It will be one of a range of management standards which the Health and Safety Executive will draw up.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para2"></a>We plan to invite well-known experts in the field to act as members of the advisory group. Once the management standard is set and adopted, it will be applied by the HSE when advising organisations about good practice in dealing with bullying. They have a highly respected team of officers in the field who are well placed to deal with this issue.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para3"></a>We believe that this is a sounder basis for progress than invoking statutory procedures for bullying. We see real difficulties in that approach. There is the problem of assigning a precise definition to bullying, which my noble friend Lady Gibson acknowledged. It is unclear what the term "manager" might mean. That term is not used anywhere else in the statutory procedures. It is intrinsically difficult to assign a right to appeal to third parties; voluntary procedures do not provide for this in general and we have based the statutory procedures on existing practices.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para4"></a>We recognise that managers or others accused of bullying might want to have their voice heard. I believe that the statutory procedures allow for this. Managers are also employees. They would be entitled to use the statutory procedures in exactly the same way as their junior colleagues. Aggrieved managers could raise a separate grievance with their employee about the way they have been treated by their employer's consideration of another employee's complaint about bullying.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para5"></a>That approach makes more sense and avoids introducing unusual steps into the procedures. I make it clear that the Government understand the point which my noble friend Lady Gibson made very effectively on Report. There is a growing awareness of bullying as a workplace issue. There is already excellent guidance and information on bullying, which is published by the HSE and ACAS. The existing ACAS code on disciplinary and grievance procedures discusses the special circumstances which may apply in cases of bullying.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para6"></a>My noble friends Lady Gibson and Lord Lea asked how we can increase awareness of these codes and potential remedies. They put forward a valid analogy going back to when the issues of racial and sexual harassment were first raised around 20 years ago. We shall be doing more to raise awareness of good practice and entitlements.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para7"></a>The DTI in close collaboration with ACAS, the Small Business Service and others, intends to launch a major initiative to publicise the Bill, giving full <P>

<A NAME="20627-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that answer, which I am pleased with. Although I would have liked the word "bullying" in the Bill or the regulations, I am happy to know about the future work of the Health and Safety Commission and I look forward to it. I am aware of the good practice and the work of the officers in the field from my former time as a commissioner in the Health and Safety Commission. They are experts in that area. I am happy that they are to be involved.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para10"></a>I place on record my sincere thanks to my noble friend the Minister for his understanding approach to the amendments. It is good to debate when an employer and I mostly agree. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-10_para14"></a><P>

<a name="20627-10_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment tidies up the wording in Schedule 4, which lists the jurisdictions to which the admissibility regime will apply. It removes two jurisdictions from the list&#151;the Employment Tribunal Extension of Jurisdiction (England and Wales) Order and the corresponding order for Scotland. These two orders ensure that tribunals can consider certain breach of contract cases in which the employment relationship has already ended. In other words, former employees can bring claims of breach of contract to tribunals. Current employees must use the courts to resolve contractual disputes with their employer.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para16"></a>Our stated policy is that the admissibility regime will not apply to former employees except when constructive dismissal is claimed, so there is no need to include these jurisdictions in Schedule 4 because they apply to ex-employees only. The amendment therefore removes unnecessary wording from the schedule.

<FONT SIZE=3>now pass, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Sainsbury and myself I express my appreciation to all Members of the House who have taken part in proceedings on the Bill. I thank the Opposition and Liberal Democrat Front Benches, but also those on the Government Back Benches who subjected us to intensive interrogation. We had 10 very difficult sessions in Grand Committee. I shall not conceal from my noble friend Lady Turner that she and her friends caused us a great deal of grief.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para18"></a>Changes have been made to the Bill. My noble friends clearly felt passionately about the issues that they were raising. I hope that my noble friend Lady Turner agrees that the Government's attitude has not been set in stone, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, described it at the outset. We have made changes that my noble friends Lady Turner and Lord Lea and other friends with trade union experience have welcomed. We even made a recent change that was inspired by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon. All of that has meant that the consideration of the Bill has been proper, in parliamentary terms.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para19"></a>I also pay tribute to the Bill team from the employment relations division of the Department of Trade and Industry. They have worked long and hard to great effect to ensure that the arguments for the Bill were put as well as feeble Ministers could put them and that the importance of debate in your Lordships' House was recognised. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20627-10_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Filkin) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 8th May be approved [29th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para23"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the order has been made in exercise of the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by Section 71 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which I shall refer to from now on as RIPA. Section 71(1) of RIPA requires the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice relating to the exercise and performance of powers and duties under RIPA. This code of practice relates particularly to the interception of communications, as set out in Part I, Chapter I of the Act, and not to access to communications data, which is covered separately in Part I, Chapter II of RIPA.
<P>


<a name="column_1543"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1543</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para24"></a>The interception of communications code of practice relates to the exercise and performance of the powers and duties set out in Chapter I of Part I of RIPA in respect of the interception of communications. The code supports the Act by providing clear and unambiguous guidance on the lawful interception of communications in the United Kingdom. The code was welcomed in another place as providing helpful guidelines and more clarity about the interception provisions in the Act. I hope that it will receive similar support in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para25"></a>Section 72 of RIPA provides that any person exercising such powers or duties shall have regard to the provisions in such codes of practice. Section 71(3) requires all draft codes of practice issued under RIPA to be published and requires the Secretary of State to consider any representations made to him about the draft. Public consultation on the interception of communications code of practice lasted from 25th September 2000 to 17th November 2000. The results of the consultation have been made available on the Home Office website.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para26"></a>I shall say a few words about the policy background. The provisions in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 relating to the interception of communications replace those in the Interception of Communications Act 1985 to take account of two issues: first, the movement and development of new technologies, and secondly, Human Rights Act obligations. Importantly, they also provide for the first time for a statutory code of practice to be approved by Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para27"></a>The interception code of practice sets out how the provisions contained in Chapter I of Part I of RIPA regulate the interception of communications. It remains the case that the Secretary of State is required to issue a warrant authorising interception only for the purposes set out in the Act. Secondly, warrants may be applied for only by the security and intelligence services, the police, Customs and Excise or the Chief of Defence Intelligence.
<P>

<a name="20627-10_para28"></a>The code sets out the procedures to be followed by agencies when applying for an interception warrant from the Secretary of State, as well as giving guidance to agencies and others on giving effect to warrants and the disclosure, copying and retention of material obtained through warranted interception. The code also sets out how, under RIPA, interception can lawfully take place without a warrant in specific circumstances, such as when there are reasonable grounds to believe that all parties have consented to an interception. Importantly, it provides guidance on the necessity and proportionality considerations that must be taken into account to ensure consistency with ECHR and Human Rights Act obligations. The code has the support of the law enforcement and intelligence and security services and, importantly, of the Interception of Communications Commissioner, who provides independent oversight of the process. I commend the order to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   My Lords, I can be very brief. As always, I thank the Minister for his careful explanation, during the course of which he referred to the welcome given in another place. He carefully quoted the words of my honourable friend Dominic Grieve. I confirm that, in the spirit of joined-up opposition, I agree with my honourable friend. We welcome the making of the order.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para0"></a>It may be appropriate for me to make clear that the order is vastly different from the two RIP orders that were most recently withdrawn by Mr Blunkett, the Home Secretary. I had laid Motions against those orders in your Lordships' House. I recognise that this order is benign. I was grateful that the Government thought again on the other two and took a proper course of action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may also exercise joined-up opposition. In another place my colleague, Richard Allan, the Member for Sheffield Hallam, supported this order. I believe that Mr Allan must be among those best qualified to speak on high technology matters. He is a real computer and Internet "geek"&#151;I am sure that he would not mind that description. I probably occupy the opposite end of the scale of understanding.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para1"></a>However, I have certain battle honours in this matter. I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, in his place. Together with the noble Lord, Lord Cope, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, and I spent many happy hours going through the rather Orwellian-sounding RIP Bill to get it on to the statute book.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para2"></a>Perhaps I may also take a moment to welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, to her new role in taking on the Home Office brief. I left the Home Office brief for the joys of broadcasting and she moved in the opposite direction. I can only tell her that, from my own experience of four years with the Home Office brief, she has many interesting hours on that Bench ahead of her if I know Home Office legislation.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para3"></a>As to RIPA and the passage of the order tonight, I believe that the noble Baroness has put her finger on a matter of which the Government must now be well aware. During the passage of the Bill, concerns were expressed on all sides of the House about civil liberties and the constraints that needed to be put on the authorities in their use of powers.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para4"></a>I commend the initiative of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, in making clear that her side of the House would pray against the recent orders, as shall we. The Government must think very hard before they try to extend their powers under RIPA. We are going to test Ministers very hard on necessity and proportionality. Those were included in the Bill with great thought and they will be applied, particularly in this House, with great vigilance. I believe that it is a liberal&#151;with a small "l"&#151;but important principle <P>


<a name="column_1545"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1545</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that limits should be placed on the powers of the state; that is, limits on what the authorities are entitled to know about an individual.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para5"></a>I also accept that, as the Minister mentioned in introducing the order, the world has changed dramatically since 1985. RIPA is required both in terms of new technologies and, indeed, globalisation. Not only has the economy globalised; so have crime and terrorism. It is a matter of getting that balance right.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para6"></a>In terms of ministerial responsibility, the concern for proportionality in relation to the necessity of and respect for civil liberties does not fly out of the window with ministerial office. Ministers do not change sides when they take office. We hope that Ministers look at these matters with an eye to defending those principles. When Parliament gives the security services and other agencies of state the powers to intercept and to bug, it is very important that the political masters apply strong and stringent tests in defence of civil liberties. I hope that recent events have demonstrated that certainly on these Benches an acute examination will be made of any attempts to extend the powers, together with an examination of the justification for them.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para7"></a>As I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will confirm, the Bill had a thorough going over in this House. The protections which appear in the Act, and which are reflected in this code of practice, were inserted for a very important reason&#151;a reason relating to civil liberties and human rights, to which we all adhere.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_time0"></a><H5>5.45 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I thank both Opposition Benches for the way in which they have responded to the code. I also take on board with some anticipation the Gypsy's warning that they both offered in terms of the order that is not before us tonight. As noble Lords know, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has signalled that we shall reflect and consult and then come back to the House. On that occasion I am sure that noble Lords will, indeed, give an acute examination of what we place before them.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para8"></a>I believe that the Act itself has been a good process. Thus far, it has been implemented in a thoughtful way because it seeks to do exactly what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, signalled. It recognises the reality of the threats to our society in terms of criminality and terrorism and yet, at the same time, it seeks to tread the very difficult tightrope of not being other than robust in protecting society while not abandoning the values that underpin why we believe that that society is worth protecting. I believe that the Act and this order do that neatly.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para9"></a>The Act has a code which, for the first time, sets out in extremely clear English language, which I found pleasurable to read, the principles on which public bodies must act and the principles against which they will be called to account.
<P>


<a name="column_1546"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1546</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para10"></a>As the House knows, the Act also set up two mechanisms to ensure that it was not viewed simply as a piece of paper. The first related to a tribunal's investigatory powers to deal with complaints by individuals when they felt that they had been wrongly or inappropriately investigated. The second concerned the independence of the interception of the Communications Commissioner, who clearly has substantial powers to investigate what government are doing under the powers of the Act.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para11"></a>I believe that that threefold structure is a good one. We look forward to its implementation and, it is hoped, to the effective use of the powers to intercept criminals and terrorists in a way that respects the values to which we adhere.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, during the passage of the Bill one area caused concern. It was that economic well-being would be seen as a catch-all. I believe that the code removes that fear, but I wonder whether the Minister will comment on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, economic well-being is not an all-encompassing power. Clearly one could argue that economic well-being encompassed almost anything that happened in society. But economic well-being had to be related in some way to the issues contained in the Act&#151;that is, the security of the state or criminality. I believe that Members in another place discussed BMW and what was happening in the West Midlands. Clearly, simply the fact that a company might change its ownership in no way touched on the security of the state, even if people had views about whether or not that was desirable. It had to be relevant to security or criminality.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para12"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Grocott: </B>   My Lords, as noble Lords know, the next Business is an important Unstarred Question on the Ministry of Defence Skill Force pilot schemes. I shall end my oratory at that point because my noble friend Lord Bach has arrived, with perfect timing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, rises to his feet, perhaps the House will permit my making a brief intervention. I am delighted that the House has not had to be adjourned. I apologise if I have caused difficulty. I was fortunate today to be invited to the Royal Jubilee Portsmouth Armed Forces ceremony from which I have just returned. I hope that that has not caused noble Lords any inconvenience. I am amazed at how expeditious the House has been today.

<A NAME="20627-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   My Lords, as prior notice had been given that the sitting would be suspended until 6.30 p.m. to await the return of the Minister&#151;that is not a criticism of the fact that the sitting would be suspended&#151;my noble friend Lady Seccombe is not in her place and would not want to miss the opening speeches.

<P>

<a name="20627-11_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when the Minister returned, he kindly said that he hoped that the House had not been inconvenienced. There has been absolutely no inconvenience. One knows what pressures Ministers are under. I am very pleased that it is this Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bach&#151;who will be replying because of his position in the Ministry of Defence and also, I suspect, because of his interest. So we are very grateful.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para16"></a>Indeed, there is some advantage to your Lordships. Because this is last business we are allowed a little extra time&#151;12 minutes&#151;on what I believe to be an important subject. I also thank other noble Lords for taking an interest in what may seem to some arcane subject but which actually is extremely important and presages important further changes in the future.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para17"></a>I declare an interest as the president of the council of Reserve Forces and Cadets Associations in the United Kingdom. For the benefit of your Lordships, the Reserve Forces and Cadets Associations, which many of your Lordships will remember as the TAVRs&#151;the Territorial Army and Volunteer Reserves&#151;fulfils an important role. The council is the overarching body which looks after the 13 independent associations covering the different regions of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para18"></a>For the purposes of the debate, I put on record that there are 125,000 cadets in the United Kingdom. Later, I shall have something to say about their role, and their complementary role, to the skill force initiative. But I am speaking in a personal capacity. I do not in any way intend to speak for my colleagues up and down the country who are perfectly capable of speaking for themselves in the reserve forces and cadets associations. However, I believe that I capture the spirit of support of many of them, both those who staff the individual associations and those who sit on the governing bodies.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para19"></a>I say at the outset that I very much welcome the initiative of the Ministry of Defence in launching the Skill Force initiative. I congratulate the Government on the initiative. I hope very much that it will continue and grow. Therefore, I hope that there will be very much a multi-partisan approach to the issue today.
<P>


<a name="column_1548"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1548</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para20"></a>It may help your Lordships if I briefly try and describe what Skill Force is. Clearly, the Minister will give more information, but for those who read a debate sometimes it is helpful at the outset to see the context of the debate rather than going directly to the Minister's speech and then reading backwards.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para21"></a>Skill Force is staffed by former warrant officers and officers from the Armed Forces. They provide skills training to&#151;typically&#151;14 to 16 year-olds. At the moment, the total is about 1,200. That is 1,200 set in the context of 125,000 in our cadet organisations. Those youngsters perhaps have been playing truant from school and/or have been disruptive in the classroom and therefore have been excluded.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para22"></a>Skill Force takes those youngsters for one day a week, perhaps two half days, out of school&#151;they must go back to school for the other four days&#151;and provides them with some non-military training, skills we would describe as "essential skills" such as how one works in a team; how one relates to and communicates with people&#151;courteously and politely and directly; how one tackles everyday problems; how one organises one's day; how one relates to one's parents; and how one relates to one's teachers. These are basic skills which will lead in some cases to, for example, the Duke of Edinburgh's bronze award or other qualifications.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para23"></a>The purpose, I understand, is that when youngsters reach 16 they stay on at school for further education in the sixth form, enter some form of training scheme or go into employment. They do not become a social walking disaster and end up either on probation or in prison or, as adults, replicating their past behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para24"></a>I understand that the early results have been encouraging. For those who have participated in the scheme so far, attendances at school are up&#151;in other words, truancy rates are falling&#151;and fewer have been excluded by teachers for disruptive behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para25"></a>All that is good news. I want to make the point forcefully that this scheme is non-military. The youngsters are not in uniform; they are not handling weapons. It is unlike the American scheme&#151;the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps scheme&#151;which is very much aligned with the services. It perhaps has some of the same purposes as the United Kingdom scheme, but this is non-military.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para26"></a>Briefly, perhaps I may sketch the background to the problem of truancy. We know that the Government have set a target to reduce truancy by one-third during the year 2002&#150;03. Extra money has been provided for schools to tackle poor behaviour. The figures do not seem to have changed very much&#151;even in the last reported year&#151;over the last five years. But, on average, about 1 per cent&#151;and here I am talking about pupils in maintained secondary schools&#151;regularly have unauthorised absences from school of at least half a day a week. That is a disturbing number. These children are playing truant.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para27"></a>There is, I believe, a great correlation between truancy and lack of educational achievement. Frankly, truancy is related. There is a higher degree of <P>


<a name="column_1549"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1549</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>correlation with schools in deprived areas, and, therefore, perhaps a lack of parental support in some cases.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para28"></a>We know that education welfare officers and local police patrol the streets to find truanting children. Police have the power to return children to school. Education welfare officers talk to parents and remind them that they have a legal duty to make sure that their child is at school.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para29"></a>Many of your Lordships will have seen the recent BBC report. In May, almost 12,000 children were caught playing truant in sweeps of the streets and surrounding areas close to the school in 34 education authorities in England with the worst absenteeism record&#151;12,000 children.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para30"></a>Sanctions we know about and which have been discussed in recent weeks are imprisonment of parents, cuts in benefit payments and police in schools. I am not addressing those issues. I am supporting the concept of Skill Force, which is more about encouragement and trying to teach basic human skills to youngsters in this category.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para31"></a>The criticism made in some quarters&#151;I believe it is a minority&#151;that somehow this initiative is in competition with the cadet forces is misplaced. I cannot trace at the Ministry of Defence any switching of resources away from supporting cadet organisations to Skill Force. I hope that those who read this debate will be reassured on that point.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para32"></a>It is interesting to note that the aims of the cadet organisations are similar to those of Skill Force. The stated aims of the cadet organisations, although there are slight differences as between the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force, the Air Training Corps and the Combined Cadet Force, are to help young people towards responsible adulthood, to encourage valuable personal attributes and to foster confidence, self-reliance, initiative, loyalty and a sense of service to others. If that does not encapsulate what we hope for from Skill Force, I am not sure what else we could ask. Its difference from the cadet organisations is that they use military themes, based upon the culture and ethos of the single services.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para33"></a>But the main aims are similar. It is interesting to note that about one-third of youngsters on Skill Force projects either have been or are in the cadets. So there is an overlap, which is significant.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para34"></a>On behalf of some of my colleagues who work in and support the reserve forces and cadets organisations, I hope that we shall be able to provide administrative backbone support for that initiative&#151;perhaps by providing some of the administrative arrangements, housekeeping and financial book-keeping.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para35"></a>I pay tribute to the team at the Ministry of Defence associated with the initiative. In particular, Dr Moonie MP, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, has given it tremendous support. Colonel Cross and Mr Gary Lewitt, of the Ministry of Defence, have been extremely supportive and have pioneered much of the work.

<a name="20627-11_para36"></a>We should congratulate the Government on the extent to which they have achieved joined-up government here. The Department for Education and Skills and the Treasury seem to be playing a full role. Indeed, the Treasury is substantially funding the scheme; the money is not coming from the Ministry of Defence budget to any significant extent. We should congratulate the former warrant officers and officers involved. They provide an excellent example to the youngsters and receive a good employment. When my noble friend Lord Cranborne was a Minister, he introduced an initiative similar to this. It did not get off the ground. I tried unsuccessfully to do so myself, 15 years ago, when holding a similar position to my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para37"></a>I hope that noble Lords visit the pilots. I visited the pilot in Islington. I was extremely impressed by the youngsters; they were intelligent and interested. I hope to welcome them to the Houses of Parliament to give them a tour. I am sure that it is an entirely different world from the one to which they are accustomed. The scheme deserves support and continuation.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para38"></a>This may be a small financial step for the Ministry of Defence, but it is a giant step for joined-up government.

<A NAME="20627-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, both on the initiative that he has deployed to secure this debate and on the analysis that he presented to the House. The Skill Force proposal is one of considerable value. Although I shall suggest its widening, that does not mean that I support its replacement.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para39"></a>As I am extremely interested in the Air Training Corps, I was grateful for the noble Lord's explanation that there is no conflict between it and Skill Force. I certainly agree that I should not want the Ministry of Defence to deploy resources away from the cadet forces, because they probably provide the best recruits that the Armed Forces receive.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para40"></a>However, the principle could be applied in a way that would be rather more a service of prevention of disruptive behaviour and exclusion from school. I trust that the House will have some sympathy with the arguments that I shall deploy.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para41"></a>I was a schoolmaster a long time ago. As a young teacher, I realised&#151;I realise even more as the years pass&#151;how much I was helped by older colleagues with substantial experience in the Second World War. Because of that experience, they had a broader approach, were more mature and probably had a more marked sense of humour, which their experience had developed. They were very good at the job.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para42"></a>I accept that teachers' position today is rather different; it is a different society. There are more broken homes and there is more marital breakdown, greater criminality, the drugs problem, and so on. There is probably a higher proportion of irresponsible parents. That is why I can see an argument for the extension of the approach commended by the noble Lord.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para43"></a>I do not suggest that we can use the Armed Forces to replace teachers. A few months ago, I visited a primary school close to my home and went into five classrooms. There were five non-teaching assistants&#151;good, local ladies. They were not teaching. They were tying shoelaces for the little ones; they were helping to issue equipment; they were listening to children read. They were, as it were, a cross between mothers and teachers. They are valuable in primary schools.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para44"></a>There may still be a place for such assistance for the younger age groups in secondary schools, but the most useful auxiliary assistance&#151;especially for schools that are socially deprived or where the disruptive behaviour problem is especially marked&#151;could be provided by ex-servicemen.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para45"></a>Many people will have seen the television programme, "Lad's Army", and think that that is what the services are like now. From my experience, it was rather accurate, but that was a long time ago. Today, we have professional rather than conscript forces. Servicemen in all three services are led rather than bullied. Those who have served, who have given their 20-odd years and are coming out with enormously valuable experience and a capacity of man-management that may be unequalled in other parts of our society, could make an extremely valuable contribution by assisting schools in their pastoral role.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para46"></a>Many teachers today may feel uneasy dealing with disruptive children. Many of them may not feel especially eager to encounter the more obnoxious parent. People with substantial military experience would not be quite so deterred. They would have a confidence and maturity to deal with the problem which may not be readily available in the school staff room. They could certainly deal with truancy.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para47"></a>We must accept that a substantial proportion of children playing truant from school are doing so with the full knowledge and approval of their parents. We must also accept that the irresponsible parent is unlikely to go to the parents' meeting or to co-operate with the school. A pastoral fulfilment of the skills of the senior non-commissioned officers of our Armed Forces could make an enormous difference.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para48"></a>Schools may be uneasy at first at the arrival of a sergeant major&#151;especially where staff think that "Lad's Army" represents the service that we have today. But they would rapidly find that the children would be provided with a role model far better than others that may be held before them.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para49"></a>So I strongly welcome Skill Force. I trust that it will complement the cadet forces, which are most useful. But I also believe that we could extend the pilot scheme to ensure that there is involvement within the school to counter the disruptive tendency and to provide a means to prevent problems that will otherwise fuel criminality for a long time ahead.

<A NAME="20627-11_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I first thank my noble friend Lord Freeman for introducing the debate and for his lucid explanation of how Skill Force works. It has my full and unequivocal support. I also declare an <P>


<a name="column_1552"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1552</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interest. My daughter and son-in-law are both serving officers in the Royal Air Force. I was myself a fairly lowly member of the Royal Air Force more years ago than I care to mention. My husband served in the Royal Air Force as a test pilot. I serve at present in the Air League Council and am an Air League Council member on the National Air Cadet Council, which is a body sponsored by the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para50"></a>I know that my noble friend's description highlighting the important role of cadets is supported by the noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath, who has a long-standing interest in cadets and an active interest in the work of the Air Cadets, as I do myself. We need no persuading of the contribution that they can make. I lose no opportunity&#151;and the noble Lord has taken this opportunity&#151;to say how much the work of all cadet forces has contributed to turning around the lives of young people. Many young people who are not secure at home and do not have the support of a loving and nurturing family have, by one means or another, found their way into cadet forces. Their life has been turned around, and they have made positive contributions to their community from then on. They have also become more fulfilled themselves and have acquired skills that set them up for life.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para51"></a>For a long time, education has been an interest of mine. The noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath, made a point about early intervention and the contribution that could be made by former members of the Armed Forces and members of the cadet forces in our schools. When the noble Lord spoke, I was reminded of a neighbour of ours from the time when our children were very small. We were talking about the unexpended energy of young people, of which there is a great deal. It is a problem. Often, if children expend their energy at all out of school, they do so in the wrong way. I remember my neighbour saying that it would be a good idea if ex-members of the Armed Forces, particularly physical training instructors, could be used when there were early signs of disruptive behaviour in the classroom. They could work with disruptive children out of the classroom, so that they could go back into the classroom. There was a deep intake of breath from those who heard her say that, but here we are, so many years later, making the same comments. My noble friend Lord Freeman talked about something much more sophisticated, which would use the talents and expertise of the Armed Forces and the cadet forces and the disciplined, structured way in which they operate to benefit other young people.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para52"></a>My noble friend referred to another of my noble friends, Viscount Cranbourne, and to a similar MoD scheme that did not get off the ground. In fact, it did get off the ground. At the time, I was a Home Office Minister and my noble friend Lord Cranbourne was a Minister at the Ministry of Defence. We had some difficulty in convincing the Department for Education that it was a good scheme, but we were undaunted, and our two departments jointly funded a scheme at Applecross on the Wills estate on the west coast of Scotland. The idea was to bring together for three, four or five weeks a group of vulnerable young people who <P>


<a name="column_1553"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1553</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were, perhaps, living slightly on the edge and getting involved in petty crime, and a group of young leaders, including young civil servants, people from the Probation Service and&#151;the Ministry of Defence's contribution&#151;cadets. Those people were put together there for a month and given activities.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para53"></a>The weakness of such schemes is often exposed when the young people are sent back to their communities. That is when all the good work that has been done with them out of that environment is undone. However, there was a wonderful voluntary organisation called Fairbridge that supported the young people as they moved back into their community and built on the work that had been done in Applecross. The rug has been pulled out from under that project. That is the only note of dissension that I shall introduce to our debate.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para54"></a>The scheme is now living rather hand to mouth, looking around for ways of sustaining itself. I am pleased to say that the cadet movement found the scheme very valuable. Not only were vulnerable young people benefiting, but the young potential leaders were benefiting too. They were improving their leadership and management skills. When the young people were together, the vulnerable young people found that there were things that they could do better than the so-called leader and management group. That was a wonderful aspect of the scheme, and there were benefits all round. The scheme, which took place in a beautiful part of the country and was supported by the most amazing voluntary effort by the cadet forces, the MoD and the Home Office, had a great impact on the lives of the young people.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para55"></a>It is important to try to keep such schemes going. There is a tendency in government, when something is well established and working, for civil servants to look around for something more novel and leave other schemes to fend for themselves. I must plead guilty to having done that in my time in government. Some schemes provide disproportionate benefit to the community, and I would like to think that they would continue.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para56"></a>I warmly thank my noble friend for giving us the opportunity to recognise the work of former members of the Armed Forces and of the cadet forces and to put in a plea for a little help from their friends. I know that the Minister is such a friend.

I served in the Ministry of Defence with my noble friend Lord Freeman. Subsequently, I became a vice-chairman of the Army Cadet Force, and I am now, along with my noble friend Lady Blatch, a member of the Air League Council. I have had a long interest in the cadet forces and am a warm supporter of the work of the ACF, the Air Training Corps and the Sea Cadets, although the Sea Cadets are more loosely connected with the Ministry of Defence than are the other cadet forces.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para57"></a>I agree strongly with the case put by my noble friend Lord Freeman for the initiative to which his Question refers. Retiring NCOs, in particular, are an enormously valuable resource, which we should employ to the national good. The expansion of the Army Cadet Force, for example, has often been constrained by the availability of adult instructors. It is always desirable that they should include considerable numbers of former Army NCOs. In past years, there have also been policemen. They were not necessarily retired policemen but may have had time available to bring their expertise and experience to bear on the instruction of young people. Several years ago, when I was concerned with such matters, we sought to expand the Army Cadet Force to include many more girls. Initially, that move was seriously constrained by the availability of female instructors, although, eventually, that problem was overcome.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para58"></a>We must make it clear that the cadet forces are not just recruiting agencies for the Armed Forces. They are much more than that. They are youth organisations that provide a focus and a range of activities for young people. Often membership of a cadet force does not lead to a career in the Armed Forces, nor is it intended to. The cadet forces are an enormously valuable resource for the purposes that my noble friend Lord Freeman described, ably supported by my noble friend Lady Blatch and the noble Lord, Lord Hardy of Wath.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para59"></a>Nowadays, comparatively small numbers of cadets join the Armed Forces. Because the cadet forces are so active in urban areas, and in inner-city areas in particular, they play an enormously valuable role in the way that has been described. So, I support the Skill Force initiative. It is said that additional resources will be required if the initiative is to be expanded to the 100 or so units that are hoped for. I hope that the additional funds can be found, whether they come from the Ministry of Defence or anywhere else. It is a crucially important initiative for the young people of our country, and I support what my noble friend Lord Freeman and others said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-11_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, for initiating the debate. Unlike the other speakers, I had not heard of Skill Force before I saw it in future business. I found it difficult to work out what it was about, until I got some briefing. I am not a great expert, unlike previous speakers. My qualifications are slightly less lustrous than theirs. I served only as an officer in the TA&#151;perhaps "served" is not the right word&#151;having been dragooned into the CCF over 20 years ago.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para60"></a>The Skill Force scheme is outside the military-uniform environment. (My experience relates to the CCF. We wore shirts which seemed to be made of the coarsest fibres known to man.) That has to be a good thing. Skill Force is a progressive scheme. Its aim is to tackle one of the major problems facing the educational system today&#151;exclusion. Exclusion is the nuclear option in the education system. For schools it is to a degree a mark of failure but it also demonstrates <P>


<a name="column_1555"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the limitations of the options available. It has detrimental effects on the pupils' future education and prospects.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para61"></a>Skill Force is not the only scheme which seeks to deal with the problem of exclusion. Young@now is an organisation which works with local pupil referral units. Its Jolt Programme supports disaffected young people by building on their latent skills and abilities outside conventional academic structures, helping to re-introduce them into mainstream education. It does excellent work.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para62"></a>Another organisation with which I am closely associated is in the North East. It is an art project called Kids Kabin and works with younger children. One of the problems is that exclusion often starts at an early stage. That body seeks to use art and free expression to give the children esteem.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para63"></a>From briefings and research I have undertaken, Skill Force seems an extremely progressive scheme. The brochure sets out optimistic, even aspirational, targets: 100 per cent to achieve the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme; 100 per cent to achieve a Level One OCR Certificate in Preparation for Employment; and 100 per cent to achieve the St John's Ambulance 3 star Young Lifesavers Award. A hopeful target is a 50 per cent reduction in school exclusion. However, from the pilot project that figure seems not to be optimistic but achievable. That has to be related to the many years' experience of the instructors who go into schools. With schools being given outside resources, the teachers view the scheme as worth while. It is good that the scarce resources of the school are not used in that area.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para64"></a>I foresee one problem. Funding for the scheme seems to come from the Treasury. The Treasury is not known for its never-ending supply of largesse. Therefore, I have one question. Which department will be given the responsibility in the long term for this extremely successful scheme? Perhaps the MoD should take it up in the long term. Although the project is not seen as a vehicle for recruitment, it presents the Army in an extremely good light. Those excluded, and other school children, could become valuable members of the Armed Forces. Having worked on TA recruitment, I know that the Army is seen less and less as a favourable career path. The military are not seen as the natural career option for people at present.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para65"></a>Skill Force is an excellent scheme. Having worked with many children through some of the activities of Kids Kabin, I believe that its real success is demonstrated in an article written by the children. They said that they were going to school so that they would not be thrown off the Skill Force project which they enjoyed. That has to be seen as a mark of success.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para66"></a>I join other noble Lords in congratulating my noble friend Lord Freeman on highlighting the Skill Force initiative and bringing it to the attention of Members of your Lordships' House in such an explicit and interesting way. Like other noble Lords, I very much support measures that assist young people who are at risk of becoming disaffected with mainstream education. I am sure that we all agree that it is vital to re-engage with these young people so that they can reap the benefits from some type of formal education.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para67"></a>I understand that Skill Force is a scheme modelled on one that originated in the USA. Pilot schemes were launched in this country as the Armed Forces Youth Initiative in September 2000. It was then modified and expanded 12 months later to include 47 schools. In addition, it was renamed the Ministry of Defence Skill Force. Trained instructors who had served in the UK forces were initially allocated to the pilot schemes. I understand that the American scheme is a far more disciplined one and I presume that because of its success the Government adopted the initiative. However, I understand that today the only common factor of the two schemes that remains is that ex-servicemen are recruited to mentor in schools.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para68"></a>Truancy is the scourge of our age and made more disturbing by the fact that many parents do not appear to be taking a responsible approach to the widespread problem. Indeed, as my noble friend Lord Freeman outlined, truancy patrols working in May found that almost 12,500 children were absent from school. Around half of those stopped were with a parent. What chance do those children have if their parents take such a cavalier attitude?
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para69"></a>Many of the candidates for this programme have a history of truancy. As a result, they are often way behind their peers, their level of achievement is low and their self-esteem is negligible. Government statistics reveal that truancy has increased by 11 per cent over the past five years. It is now a problem of major proportions.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para70"></a>I believe that many of these young people have not had the advantage of discipline in their lives at home and as a consequence find it hard to conform to the rules and regulations imposed on them during their school day. They appear to find it difficult to arrive on time, to learn basic skills or to be a part of everyday school life. More alarmingly, they can be a disruptive influence and cause the rest of the class to miss out. It is, therefore, in the interest of everyone that action is taken to try to get them interested in some form of learning.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para71"></a>The standard of discipline within our schools is worrying and I believe made worse by the Government's decision in 1998 to reduce exclusions of disruptive pupils regardless of the circumstances. This decision undermined the authority of heads and teachers and has led to more violence. I am delighted that the Government have now reversed this disastrous policy and I hope that heads and governors will now have real power to make decisions on exclusion based on individual circumstances.
<P>


<a name="column_1557"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1557</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para72"></a>Many of these disruptive pupils have probably lacked discipline all their lives. A lifestyle without boundaries known, accepted and understood can lead only to erratic behaviour where everyone suffers and the one who suffers the most is the young person out of control.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para73"></a>That brings me to my first question. Why was it decided to have a less structured form of the American programme if its success was based on a more formal approach?
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para74"></a>At the same time as we are expressing our concern about one group of young people, we must not forget, as many noble Lords have confirmed, that another group has been mentioned: I refer, of course, to the cadets of all the services. As my noble friend Lord Freeman has said, 125,000 dedicated young people, week in and week out, are involved in training activities. As we have heard from noble Lords, they are decent young people who have their lives under control. They are role models for others and move on to become responsible citizens. The cadet forces have a close link to both the regular and the reserve forces and they provide a youth service much valued in the civil communities.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para75"></a>The Army Cadet Force is a valuable source of high calibre recruits to the regular forces and provides a military footprint within the country. It is significant to note that in the year 1999&#150;2000, 20.2 per cent of young soldiers and apprentices to the regular Army came from the Army Cadet Force and nearly 19 per cent to the TA. It acts as a link between the Armed Forces and the civil community.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para76"></a>I believe that there is a case for expanding the cadets, which will have the benefit of involving young people in discipline and team work at an early age. That should develop their sense of responsibility, and reduce the rates of truancy, exclusion from school and street crime by young gangs. I believe that the Ministry of Defence should examine how the cadet forces can be enlarged and provide the appropriate resources, within its budget, to fund that valuable organisation. With other noble Lords, I applaud the achievements of those cadets.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para77"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister would publish, or deposit in the Library, the British Market Research Bureau's report on the results of the Skill Force pilot scheme in Norfolk and Newcastle. Funding for the Skill Force scheme is from the "Invest to Save Budget". As we have heard, it is backed by three different ministries: the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office and the DfES. That funding is for a set period. My second question is similar to that asked by other noble Lords: what will happen when that funding ceases? Another question that I must ask relates to the DfES guidance for those working with children. Have the instructors undergone local authority checks as to their suitability to work with children?
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para78"></a>The debate has been interesting and informative and we have heard very positive points on the success of the scheme. Working with these young people must be <P>


<a name="column_1558"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1558</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>demanding and exhausting and I should like to pay tribute to those instructors and their assistants who have brought a new vision to these pupils. Skill Force is giving young people the chance of a new start and it is an exciting initiative. We hope that those young lives will be transformed and, having attained positive results, that they will develop into useful and contented adult citizens. I wish the Minister well with this important work.

<A NAME="20627-11_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, we owe deep thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, for enabling the House to discuss the Skill Force initiative. I found his speech generous and positive in its approach. It was an outstanding opening to this short debate. I also thank all other noble Lords who have spoken on this important subject. I have a request to make of the noble Lord. When he brings some of the children who have benefited from this scheme to the House I ask that I can be privileged enough to meet them because it would be a joy to do so.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para79"></a>I want to consider briefly the range of contacts that the MoD has with young people. So wide are those contacts that the Ministry of Defence has signed up to implementing the core principles of "Learning to Listen", which enable the views of young people to be heard and acted upon. Each year, 200,000 to 300,000 young people have direct contact with the Armed Forces through their recruitment efforts. The activities range from climbing walls with the Royal Marines to solving problems in teams with REME. There are also opportunities for longer attachments aimed at enhancing self-esteem and confidence.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para80"></a>Secondly, as has been mentioned, there is the cadet movement, in which some 127,000 young people voluntarily engage in extra-curricular activities designed to promote qualities of responsibility, self-reliance, personal endurance, perseverance, self-confidence and discipline. And I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 23,000 or so adult volunteers involved in the cadet movement who make it such a success.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para81"></a>Nor should we forget that the MoD is responsible for providing educational facilities to the children of service families serving abroad. That is done through an agency of the department, Service Children's Education, which looks after the needs of 15,000 young people from nursery schools to sixth forms.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para82"></a>Turning now to the Skill Force itself, I shall say something about its origins. As may be well known by some noble Lords, Skill Force was created by members of a local regiment in Newcastle to offer local schools access to the skills and expertise that the Army has to offer. They were concerned that many children whom they knew were becoming disaffected with school. The Army, the Newcastle education business partnership and local teachers designed the scheme for and in Newcastle, and at that time it was called "Relaunch".
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para83"></a>The aim then was to offer a different approach from school that would re-motivate the pupils and re-engage them with school. The course gave pupils the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>chance to drop two GCSE subjects which they were unlikely to pass, and in their place to study a range of achievable awards and qualifications. The pupils selected for Skill Force came for a variety of reasons; many due to disaffection and some because of low self-esteem. The one constant feature was that they needed something outside the national curriculum. The scheme was a resounding success locally and received much support from schools, parents and the local community.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para84"></a>That is how the scheme came into being. In answer to the first question put to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, the scheme, as it has developed, was based on those early days. It was not based on the United States' scheme. It is a British product.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para85"></a>In 1999, the scheme in Newcastle was selected by the Ministry of Defence as one of its contributions towards the Government-wide commitment to youth inclusion. Skill Force, as it became known, was launched as a pilot in Newcastle and in Norfolk in September 2000 with three schools in each area, involving 150 pupils. That cohort of pupils is now leaving school with many having successfully completed all of the Skill Force challenges.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para86"></a>The selection of rural Norfolk for the second project was a deliberate attempt to establish whether or not Skill Force could flourish beyond the urban setting. The essential features of the scheme remained the same, but what is important is that each area retained a large degree of flexibility. That ability to adapt to suit local circumstances has been a key factor in making Skill Force such a success.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para87"></a>As I said, participants drop two GCSEs in order to take part in Skill Force, which offers a variety of awards and qualifications. The course has at its core the Award Scheme Accreditation and Development Network, bronze/silver, normally called the ASDAN award. That is a modular, vocational award teaching the practical skills needed for later life. An example would be pupils having to work out the various costs of purchasing a bicycle on a credit card, with a bank loan or on a credit agreement. That type of activity not only develops number handling skills, but also demonstrates the real life cost of credit.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para88"></a>The first award that most students achieve on Skill Force is the St. John's Ambulance young life-saver award. That is normally completed by Christmas of year 10 and enables pupils who have had little success in academic school life to achieve a widely recognised and respected award. The certificates are then presented in front of the whole school, boosting immeasurably the recipients' pride and confidence.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para89"></a>Pupils also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh's award at bronze level. This experience has also been extremely positive. The pupils often show reticence at the start about some activities, such as community service&#151;which is hardly surprising, as they are unlikely to have taken part in anything like that before&#151;but they quickly develop a sense of pride and ownership in the community projects. A striking example of this is in North Lanarkshire, where pupils have built bridges in local authority country parks. <P>


<a name="column_1560"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1560</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>For many it is the first time they have had the opportunity to show the results of their work to a wider audience. And the one-week expedition, which forms part of the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme, has been very popular, giving a real sense of achievement.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para90"></a>As the project has developed, the curriculum has improved and grown. At present, several teams are piloting additional qualifications. Those range from the junior sports leader to the Oxford Cambridge and RSA first certificate in preparation for employment. Skill Force will always have local variations in the curriculum not only because of local circumstances but also to bring in new ideas. The ability to adapt to suit circumstances, local requirements and pupils' needs and to carry out practical and relevant work is one of the underpinning principles of the project.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para91"></a>The other major characteristic is that recently retired service personnel undertake the project and use their instructor skills to deliver the courses. There are many advantages, not least the respect pupils have for service personnel. After all, not many pupils would consider stepping out of line when the instructor is an ex-Royal Marine.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para92"></a>I should point out to the House that Skill Force personnel are not teachers, although some may use the experience to decide if they want to take up the profession, which is also important. They are selected by the LEA and are accountable to the head teachers of the schools in which they work. Their standards are extremely high: Ofsted inspectors grade them as either very good or excellent. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, checks are rightly made.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para93"></a>From a single project in Newcastle in 1999, Skill Force now teaches 1,200 pupils in 47 schools. The selection of areas for the new scheme is based on economic deprivation indicators and educational attainment figures. Local partners, in most cases the LEA or education business partnership, manage the new schemes. They also contribute towards the costs: partnership funding is a core principle of Skill Force. Central government funding comes from the MoD and the Treasury's Invest to Save budget after a joint bid by the MoD, Department for Education and Skills and the Home Office. Due to the popularity of the scheme, 45 out of the 47 schools have asked Skill Force to take on an additional year group of pupils next September and I am pleased to tell the House that funding has been secured.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para94"></a>The debate's title is about evaluation of the scheme's success. We have ensured that the project has been regularly evaluated from the outset. A rigorous, full and independent evaluation of Skill Force was carried out by the British Market Research Bureau against its aims of reducing truancy, lowering exclusions from and improving attitudes to school, and preventing pupils leaving schools at 16 and not entering further education, employment or training. I will do my best to ensure that the evaluation is published, although I cannot give a firm guarantee.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para95"></a>The latest evaluation concentrating on the original Newcastle and Norfolk schools has shown good news. Reducing truancy levels is a key element in the strategy <P>


<a name="column_1561"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1561</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to reduce youth and street crime. Skill Force has helped to maintain attendance rates of over 90 per cent in children otherwise expected to display sharply declining attendance. Exclusion levels have also reduced dramatically. One Norfolk head teacher said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are youngsters that would have been excluded by now from school if it hadn't been for Skill Force. Some of them have got very challenging behaviours but there has been a noticeable improvement, there's also been a noticeable improvement in their attendance".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-11_para96"></a><P>

<a name="20627-11_para97"></a>The continued engagement of those young people must also have the effect of reducing juvenile crime.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para98"></a>The scheme has also had a positive impact on the emotional and mental health and well-being of participants. Another head teacher said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Some have blossomed quite positively during the course and have become much more confident, much more able, much more articulate and much more able to cope with things".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-11_para99"></a>
The evaluation process also seeks the views of the children, who state that they are now much better team-workers and have a greater respect for others. Ninety-seven per cent of children enjoyed Skill Force. These are pupils who on the whole have not had a positive experience of education.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para100"></a>One pupil stated,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Skill Force is the main reason I get up on a Monday morning".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-11_para101"></a>
Nearly six out of every 10 participants felt that their grades had improved since starting Skill Force, and just under half considered that they received fewer detentions. In the evaluation study, 20 per cent of Skill Force participants claimed to take part in voluntary activities outside school, compared to only 7 per cent of non-participants. Skill Force participants also showed increased involvement in out-of-school sports and youth clubs.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para102"></a>The scheme has been extremely well received by teachers. All teachers interviewed were positive about the impact it had upon their pupils; including children in the school not on the scheme. Here is a stunning quote from a head teacher in Newcastle:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I think schools should jump at it, they should take it, they should run with it, they should make input into it, they should press for its development throughout the country really, we really ought to be doing this in every town".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-11_para103"></a><P>

<a name="20627-11_para104"></a>Over half of parents have reported more positive behaviour and attitudes which they attribute directly to Skill Force. Ninety-seven per cent are pleased with the scheme, 33 per cent consider their children more <P>


<a name="column_1562"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column 1562</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mature, 14 per cent consider them more confident and 12 per cent consider them more positive. The effects of Skill Force on the participants are obviously highly beneficial but others gain as well. The constructive removal of disruptive pupils from classes means that the remaining pupils can make faster progress. The rapid changes in personality that the Skill Force young people undergo result in a reduction in disruption in those classes which they continue to attend.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para105"></a>As one boy remarked, being disruptive in Skill Force was not particularly sensible, so being disruptive in class was a bit silly too. A headmistress said that last September was the quietest start to a school year she could remember. These results are exemplary and the Skill Force personnel, both on the ground and in the Ministry of Defence, are to be congratulated, as are the children themselves, on having taken part in what is always a deliberately challenging series of courses and studies.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para106"></a>The outcome of the evaluation of the Newcastle and Norfolk pilots was presented to interested parties in April this year. Among those present were officials from the Department for Education and Skills. I am delighted to announce in Parliament tonight that new Skill Force projects are to be set in 11 further areas; an effective doubling of Skill Force. I am sure that that announcement will be well received. The Department for Education and Skills has offered to fund the new projects. Funding will come from the behaviour improvement programme as part of the government-wide street crime initiative.
<P>

<a name="20627-11_para107"></a>Skill Force started as a way by which army personnel set out to help disaffected youths in Newcastle. It is now delivering results in schools across England and Scotland and has earned the unanimous praise of this House. It is truly a bottom-up success story that has changed lives for the better. We all hope that it will continue to do so. Again I thank the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, for bringing this important scheme to our attention this evening.

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Murton of Lindisfarne) in the Chair.]



<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-12_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Murton of Lindisfarne): </B>  Before I call the first amendment, I should like to inform the Committee that a photographer will be taking a small number of photographs early in our proceedings today. This is for internal purposes, for inclusion in our Annual Report.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para1"></a>I think that all noble Lords are familiar with the procedure. I shall simply remind the Committee that if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting, we shall adjourn as soon as the Division Bells are rung and resume after 10 minutes or as near as possible to that time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   Before the proceedings start, may I make one comment? At Monday's Sitting it was very difficult to hear some Members of the Committee speaking. If one has to speak standing up, these microphones are not in the right place. Would it be possible in future Sittings either to have taller microphones, or for them to be propped up on a pile of books, as the Ministers and Shadow Ministers have done? Otherwise it is extremely difficult to hear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-12_spnew1"></A><B> Deputy Chairman of Committees: </B>   The noble Lady's comments have been noted and we shall see what we can do.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para2"></a>Clause 4 [Assessments etc. for adoption support services]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 15:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 4, line 12, after "needs" insert "or needs of connected persons"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-12_para3"></a><P>

<a name="20627-12_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 15 deals with one minor aspect of this extremely important clause, the bulk of which my noble friend Lord Howe will address in a later amendment. Amendment No. 15 simply widens the net of persons whose need for adoption services must be addressed by an assessment.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para5"></a>Clause 4(1) deals with those who may request assessments. We do not know precisely who those people are. Paragraph (a) says that it covers those mentioned in Clause 3(1)&#151;namely, children to be adopted, their parents and guardians, and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(b) persons wishing to adopt a child, and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-12_para6"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) adopted persons, their parents, natural parents and former guardians".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-12_para7"></a><P>


<a name="column_CWH62"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para8"></a>Clause 4(1)(b) says that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any other person who falls within . . . regulations",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-12_para9"></a>
can apply under subsection 7(a). However, we do not yet know who those people are. I hope that the Minister will say something about what those regulations will contain.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para10"></a>The main point is that the authority must assess the needs of the person who applies for an assessment under Clause 4(1) and not the needs of any other person. An adopted child can therefore apply for a needs assessment for himself but not for, say, his siblings or blood grandparents.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para11"></a>The Minister may say, as the Minister said in another place, that the assessment would in practice involve the whole family. However, the clause does not say that; it says that the applicant's needs are to be assessed. There can be no certainty that local authorities will include any connected person, let alone the full range of people that the applicant considers to be connected to his case.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para12"></a>In replying to the amendment, I hope that the Minister will also say what arrangements are to be made for applications by persons who are not competent to make applications for themselves; for example, very young children or adults who have mental impairment. The wider family may well include those who are not articulate enough or competent enough to make their own application. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us about the processes which underpin the widest possible access to needs assessments under Clause 4. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I sound a note of caution on this. There is no definition of "connected persons" in the interpretation section, at Clause 139, on page 82 of the Bill. As subsections 4(1)(a) 4(7)(b) show, this definition of "other persons" could well conflict with the persons described in those regulations. One has to take that on board to avoid some possible confusion. The resolution is in the form of the regulations, and here we come to the main problem. I raise it only once today. In a sense, we beat the air until we have the draft regulations; we came across that problem on day one. The Minister said, and I understand it, that we shall not have them until after Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para13"></a>Winston Churchill once said that the most intractable problems solve themselves in time, and we have a little time; we have the long Recess. Perhaps we could have but a draft of these regulations before we come back to Report. It is only a respectable suggestion&#151;I hope it is respectable but it is respectful&#151;because, quite frankly, I find it impossible to get to grips with the substance of much of this until I see the draft of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para14"></a>Perhaps that could be taken as a hope or a prayer. I could give all kinds of examples; I will not waste time but I went through them this morning. There are many examples today on the Marshalled List of amendments to which this applies. However, the regulation under <P>


<a name="column_CWH63"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the structure of the Bill will define this matter and one does not want to table an amendment which conflicts with the regulations as defined in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I rise briefly to support the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, and also to support the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. I believe that most Members of the Committee would add their support to that heart-felt plea, and not just in connection with this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para15"></a>First, I declare an interest as an employee of Age Concern&#151;I hope the one and only time I will do so on the Bill. The particular point that I want to follow is that made by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, concerning grandparents.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para16"></a>Grandparents, it seems to me, often have a very rough time during the process of adoption. They often fall between one set of assessments or are viewed in different ways. I do not suggest that their rights ever conflict with the welfare of children, but I believe they are sometimes treated differently, and often badly, historically. That is why I want to support the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, in trying to seek a clear definition of "associated persons".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-12_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  I understand that noble Lords are anxious to have a better feel of what might be covered in the regulations, because clearly the approach that the Bill takes is to set out some very broad principles in the primary legislation but then to leave much of the detail to regulations. I know that Members of the Committee would like nothing better than for me to produce draft regulations so that they can be considered.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para17"></a>There are considerable difficulties in doing that. One of the points that I made on the first day of Committee was that a great deal of consultation needs to take place with the relevant organisations, but much of that will eventually appear in regulations. That work has not taken place. As Members of the Committee will know the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, pressed me on the date of implementation and expressed disappointment that we were looking to 2004 for that implementation date.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para18"></a>The fact is that an awful lot of ground work needs to be done before we are in a position to produce draft regulations. However, I hope that as we go through the discussion in Committee we are able to give at least a flavour of what will be covered by those regulations together with a commitment that there will be very extensive consultation.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para19"></a>I recognise that very important matters raised in this amendment, although the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, described it as a fairly minor issue. I recognise the importance of eligibility to assessment, either in terms of a requirement under Clause 4(1) or a discretion under Clause 4(2), but we want to be as clear as possible as to who will be covered. As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, made clear, the persons listed at subsection (1) of Clause 3 will all be entitled to an assessment of their needs for adoption support <P>


<a name="column_CWH64"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services. These persons are children who may be adopted, their parents and guardians, prospective adopters and adopted people, their adoptive parents, birth parents and former guardians.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para20"></a>Adoptive families will not need to wait until after an adoption order has been made to request and receive an assessment of their needs for adoption support services. They will be able to request an assessment at any time; for example, when they have been matched with a child or when a child has been placed with them.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para21"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, suggested, additional persons prescribed in the regulations made under subsection (1)(b) of Clause 4 will also have the new right to an assessment. These persons will be those listed in the regulations made under subsection (3)(a) of Clause 3 for whom local authorities must make and participate in arrangements to provide adoption support services. It is the Government's intention that they will include birth and adoptive siblings of adopted people and children who may be adopted. However, we shall consult widely on the contents of those regulations as part of the new national framework.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para22"></a>As regards the technical wording of the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, has put his finger on it in terms of the problem with the definition or not of "connected persons", but no doubt this is a probing amendment. The issue of the needs of families is an important one. In practice, the needs of adoptive families&#151;adopted children, their adoptive parents and any adoptive siblings&#151;will all be assessed together. It would not be appropriate for the child's needs to be addressed in isolation, so the assessment will look at the needs of the family as a whole. Where a child is not of sufficient age and understanding to request an assessment, his parent may request the assessment on his behalf. An older child may choose to request an assessment himself or alternatively his parent may request the assessment on his behalf.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para23"></a>It is also worth making the point that, in relation to an adult who lacks capacity to request an assessment of needs for adoption support services, a carer may make such a request on his behalf. We intend to issue statutory guidance&#151;and I am tempting fate by mentioning that word&#151;to local authorities on the assessment process. That guidance will make the position clear. It may also make clear local authorities' responsibilities in respect of the carer's needs for adoption support services.
<P>

<a name="20627-12_para24"></a>Subsection (2) of Clause 4 gives local authorities a power to carry out an assessment of any person who does not have the right to such an assessment. I come to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. This would then enable local authorities to assess the needs of any other person, such as a grandparent, living with the adoptive family or indeed a carer or any person affected by adoption where they consider this appropriate, in order to respond to the individual circumstances of the family. Clause 4(2) is a very important flexibility which allows local authorities to use their discretion as may be appropriate. I hope that I have made the position of the Government clear and have answered as fully as I can the points that have been raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that and readily concede to my noble friend Lord Campbell that there is no definition of "connected persons". The Minister was right; this is a probing amendment and I am sure that we could devise a definition if the formulation were to find favour.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para0"></a>The Minister reiterated the lack of regulations that we will have during our consideration of the Bill. We on these Benches regret that sufficient work has not taken place to date and the time-scale of implementation. It is difficult to put the matter beyond that. However, it seems that there is a lack of commitment to putting the valuable new provisions in the Bill into operation as quickly as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   There is no lack of commitment: there is a tremendous commitment to ensuring that what we get on the statute book is right and that the implementation programme is undertaken with as much efficiency and effectiveness as possible. There is no doubt that a lot of work needs to be done. I believe that it has to be done very carefully, with full consultation and, of course, your Lordships' House will have the ability, through the scrutiny of regulations, to come back to many of these issues in the future.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para1"></a>There is evidence that since the original PIU report, and thence the White Paper, local authorities have raised their game and that many of the principles that were enunciated in the White Paper have begun to be adopted. It is not as though no progress will be made between now and 2004. Considerable progress is being made.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   How does the Minister know that? That is the problem that some of us have and we shall spend a long time debating it today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Two signposts are an increase in the number of adopted children and an increase in the amount of money local authorities have been spending since the financial year 2000&#150;2001. I am pleased to report that and we will turn to the question of money in a moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I must return to the regulations. I am sorry that we cannot have them now, but I am glad to hear that we shall be able to scrutinise them when they are published. Will they be subject to the affirmative process? I do hope so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The noble Lady anticipates a debate we are shortly to have. My recollection is that three sets of regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure; the others are subject to discussion if noble Lords pray against them. The point is that, whether they are subject to the affirmative or the negative procedure, there is an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny to take place. I remind Members of the Committee that we have had some <P>


<a name="column_CWH66"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extremely interesting debates on health regulations in the past few months that have been prayed against, so there will be ample opportunity for debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   The Minister referred to the assessment process guidance and we seem to be discussing the wider issue of information necessary for our deliberations at this point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   Would the noble Earl speak up?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I apologise to the noble Lord for not making myself clear. As we seem to be talking more about the wider issue of information that we need in order to make our deliberations on this Bill, will the Minister tell us about the assessment process? For me an important concern is that adoptive parents are well aware of the responsibility that they are taking on and particularly of the mental health needs of the children they adopt.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para2"></a>How will it be ensured that the targets being set to increase the number of children being adopted will not lead social workers to cut corners? Can we be assured that as far as possible before the placement takes place the adoptive parents will know that these children sometimes have serious mental health problems? They should know that, even if the children are behaving in an acceptable way at that point, they seem likely, from their assessment, to behave in extreme and possibly challenging ways later. Will the Minister write to me on that point if he cannot answer it now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am happy to respond, and also to write to the noble Earl. I take the point that this takes us much wider than the issue of "connected persons". Clearly, to have a vigorous adoption process, it is absolutely right that as much care and attention as possible is given to ensuring that the prospective adoptive parents understand the challenges that they are taking on. There is no question that there is a need for more children to be adopted.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para3"></a>We all agree about the outcome for adopted children, compared to the issues that face many children who are looked after. We know that the outcome for such children in terms of employment, education, and crime is very poor indeed. In sorting out the processes that we have on adoption, there is every indication that this will lead overall to enhanced lives for so many of these children.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para4"></a>If there were simply a motivation to increase the number of children adopted without ensuring that there were the most careful processes in place, I fully accept that that would defeat the whole object. I give the noble Earl my assurance that there is absolutely no intention of setting impossible targets that could only be met if people cut corners. The intention is to have a full, rigorous process before such adoption could take place and to ensure that the kind of support services that apply&#151;the noble Earl raised the question of mental health and I entirely agree with him&#151;are provided; and, as we shall debate later, that such notification is made by the local authority after an assessment to the NHS, if that is appropriate.

<a name="20627-13_para5"></a>I understand the question of frustration over timing. Nothing would please me better than to say that we could implement in 2003, but I do not believe that we can, nor that it would be sensible. We have only to look back to the implementation of the Children Act, which introduced an 18-month process after enactment of the Bill. During that process, regulations were prepared and commented upon. It is also worth reflecting on how many years it took for the Adoption Act 1976 to be implemented. We need to put that into perspective, and consider past experience with adoption and the Children Act procedures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I suspect the Minister will be chided yet further during the Committee's deliberations on the non-availability of regulations and the timing.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para6"></a>However, to return to my amendment, I was pleased that the Minister said that siblings would be included in regulations. I am also pleased that carers would be able to apply on behalf of those who lacked capacity. I was disappointed, as I am sure is the case with the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, not to hear grandparents mentioned in the same breath. The existence of a discretionary right of a local authority to make a needs assessment on certain other persons is not the same thing as a person being able to apply, as of right, because of his relationship with the adopted child.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para7"></a>For the time being, as will not surprise the Minister, I shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment. However, I believe that we will return to this matter on Report, though perhaps in a more targeted way. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para8"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-13_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20627-13_para10"></a>The noble Earl said: We come now to an issue which, perhaps more than any other in the Bill, has united opinion across the political divide; namely, the question of what the Bill ought to say about the role of local authorities in providing adoption support services. In speaking to Amendment No. 16, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 18 and 21.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para11"></a>Clause 4 contains a duty for local authorities to carry out an assessment of a person's needs for support services. The inclusion of that duty has been wholeheartedly welcomed by all commentators. This is a recognition by the Government of how vitally important it is that proper, expert support should be provided to those families who are in need of it. Advice, information, counselling, therapy, respite and financial help&#151;any of these, if provided in a timely and professional way, can make the difference between a placement that works and one that does not; it can make the difference between an adoption that succeeds and one that breaks down; and between a birth parent who is too distressed to cope and one who is capable of making rational decisions.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para12"></a>Adoptions fail because families feel unable to cope. The majority of children adopted from care have deeply difficult histories and complex emotional damage. The likelihood of an adopted child or his family needing some form of post-adoption help is very high. That help could be something quite simple or it could be something more complicated, such as multi-disciplinary therapies and various kinds of expert programmes. Whatever the case, if we are to improve upon the success rate in adoptions, there has to be help available. To make sure that it is the right kind of help, one thing is essential&#151;early preparation.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para13"></a>What does that amount to? It amounts to ensuring that an assessment for post-adoption support is carried out at an early stage in the process, the stage when it is decided that the child's best interests lie in adoption. It represents an agreed blueprint for support to which all relevant parties are fully signed up. The assessment then travels with the child into his or her adoption placement and follows on after the adoption order is made. This is a procedure that is followed by some of the best local authorities at the moment; and it works well. To look at the question of what support ought to be provided only after an order has gone through is too late, because a family can easily find itself heading into a serious crisis before help arrives.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para14"></a>Having talked to the Adoption Forum, the BAAF, the Post Adoption Centre, Adoption UK, After Adoption, and Parents for Children&#151;in fact, all the reputable organisations with day-to-day experience of adoption&#151;I believe that it is not enough for this Bill simply to enable local authorities to provide pre and post-adoption support as and when they decide to do so. The Bill should contain a duty to provide support if the assessment indicates a need. So far, the Government have fought shy of doing this on the grounds that local authorities should have autonomy to decide what services they provide to whom. That would, perhaps, be a reasonable position if there were not so much at stake.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para15"></a>Before the Minister makes any jibes about noble Lords on this side of the Committee wanting to impose micro-management from the centre, I would suggest to him that there are unique factors to consider here. If we think about the status of adopted children, they are different from that of other children by virtue of the state having intervened in their lives in a fundamental way. That intervention gives rise to a moral obligation on the part of the state to ensure that in every case the new family is given the best chance of working. Nor indeed should we be comfortable with a system that permits adoptive parents who&#151;let us remind ourselves&#151;are performing a unique public service for the benefit of society effectively to be abandoned to cope on their own. With looked-after children, there is no argument; local authorities must provide the necessary services. For children with special educational needs, help must be provided. Disabled children, living with their birth families, must receive support.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para16"></a>It is inconsistent and wrong not to look at adoption support in the same light. We should say to ourselves that adopted children, like those others, are children in need, and that society has a clear duty towards them.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para17"></a>The implementation of the moral obligation that society has to adopters implies that adopters deserve respect in the manner in which they are treated. Amendments Nos. 18 and 21 illustrate what I mean.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para18"></a>It should be incumbent on a local authority to furnish adoptive parents with a written explanation if it decides not to provide support services. In those circumstances, parents should be able to insist on a review of the decision. If all that is achieved by this Bill is a policy on the part of some local authorities, merely to go through the motions of providing an adoption service, we need to reflect on what the effect of that might be. It will certainly affect the recruitment of new adopters. It will certainly mean that children who are hard to place will remain stuck in care. It will mean a higher rate of adoption breakdown, it will lead to a poorer quality of life in adoptive families.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para19"></a>In framing new legislation for a new century, we should not consciously allow for the possibility of those things. The price of failure is a burden on society that could be far heavier than the cost of supporting adoptive families, as the Minister has already reminded us today. Around 20 per cent of adoptions fail. The cost of adoption pales into insignificance beside the cost of foster care, or the cost of secure accommodation, or, indeed, prison. To economise on adoption is a false economy.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para20"></a>There could not be any clearer case for the Government to say, "We mean business with the Bill". If they do mean business, they need look no further than these amendments for what they should now do. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-13_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I rise to support Amendment No. 16 and to speak to our Amendments Nos. 17, 19, 20 and 22.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para21"></a>Amendment No. 17 follows the assertion of a duty upon a local authority and has the same effect as Amendment No. 18 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to which he has already spoken, so I will not pursue it further. The local authority would have to acquire a written explanation of the decision not to supply support services.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para22"></a>Amendment No. 19 continues our approach by requiring the local authority to make, implement and review a plan for the provision of support services to those assessed to be in need of them.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para23"></a>Amendment No. 20 is an alternative way of achieving a similar objective. Following the amendment, subsection (5) would have the meaning that whenever a local authority has assessed a need to provide services, it should make a plan for the provision of those services and keep it under review.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para24"></a>Amendment No. 22 refers to the role of regulation of local authorities. Clause 4(7)(h) covers the role of an adoption agency in seeking to ensure that services <P>


<a name="column_CWH70"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>continue following the adoptive family's move to another local authority, and that assurance should include the provision of a named official to take over the role that the home authority has been undertaking.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para25"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, spoke very forcefully. I agree with him that there is an overwhelming argument in favour of the provision of post-adoption services and for insisting on the responsibility of a local authority for planning and ensuring its provisions. The absence of such services is widely regarded as a major predictor of failure in adoption by those most closely involved in the process, and we too have been in touch with the organisations which he named when he was speaking.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para26"></a>It has been made clear to us that, as many of the children who are adopted have experienced trauma in early life, there may be periods during the process of being adopted, of living in a adoptive family, where problems may arise which require support. However, the people who are working adoption are disappointed because the description in the 2000 White Paper of future legislation as placing,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a clear duty on local social services to provide post-adoption support",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-13_para27"></a>
does not appear to be fulfilled in the Bill. It is that clear duty on the face of the Bill that these amendments, and the noble Lords, are attempting to ensure.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para28"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, the force of this argument is increased by the fact that adoption follows state intervention in the family life of the child and his birth parents, ostensibly to improve the life of that child. We need to make sure that the objective is achieved, and the local authority is the obvious lead organisation to see that that happens.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para29"></a>Turning momentarily to cost, I understand that inserting clauses or provisions into Bills which have a financial implication is always something which the promoters of a Bill, some of the government Ministers, find a little difficult to accept, and I can understand how that should be. However, if we take a more holistic look at how the balance of costs work out, without going into too much detail, which I could if I really needed to, I believe that one must be struck by the relative costs of keeping a child in prison, in care, or even in foster care, as compared to the cost to the public purse of a child who is in adoption. There the whole burden of the upkeep of the child falls upon the adoptive family&#151;a burden which they willingly undertake.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para30"></a>For comparison, let us look at the supply of very high quality services. The suggestion based on research is that the very high level services of intensive therapeutic input, or respite care, or acute health care, would be required only by a very small number, maybe five per cent, of children in care. Even that cost, which is reckoned to be around £18,000, pales into insignificance by comparison with the costs of a child in residential care, which can be £40,000 or £50,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="20627-13_para31"></a>These are the sorts of comparisons we have to make. As regards prison, we were told in the House that the cost of keeping a person in prison is now over £40,000 <P>


<a name="column_CWH71"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a year. So, by comparison with those sorts of costs, and trying to take a holistic view, I believe that it is important on purely practical cost grounds, as well as the moral and social imperatives, to make sure that post-adoptive support is really effective.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I rise to support Amendment No. 16 and I shall be very brief. There is something curious and rather worrying about the drafting of Clause 4. Although the Minister knows perfectly well that, as a general rule, I am not in favour of placing an absolute obligation on a local authority&#151;and I do not derogate from that as a general approach&#151;the drafting of this clause worries me very much indeed.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para0"></a>One starts with an assessment. Then, the local authority decides that a person has need for adoption support services. Now let us pause. The local authority does not have to decide that; it may or may not decide it. Moreover, what it decides is a matter for the exercise of its discretion. However, having made the decision, surely there must be a duty to implement its decision, as my noble friend has pointed out. What is the sense or moral logic in having a "double whammy" here? If one decides that something ought to be done, then one jolly well ought to get on and do it. It is as simple as that. Quite frankly, I think that the drafting of the clause is open to serious objection.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para1"></a>I shall not take any more time. I support all the other amendments in this group. However, I hope that further consideration can be given to this. I think that it is a very serious matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   Has any budgeting been done for the purpose of support services? If not, will there be?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   As part of our continuing spending review discussions, we shall certainly be making an assessment of the cost of implementing the Act and of the consequential need for additional resources.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   I rise very briefly to support this group of amendments, particularly Amendment No. 16. I apologise for not being able to hear the first part of the noble Earl's speech. However, I indicated my support for an amendment such as this on Second Reading, for all the reasons for which we are familiar. Many of these children are deeply traumatised, and those who adopt them need all the help that they can get. From a financial point of view&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady David, has already indicated&#151;saving money also is an issue. The last figures that I read, from American studies, showed that every dollar spent on a child in the early years saves 14 dollars in adolescence when things start to go wrong. As we all know, this support is absolutely crucial to all the adoption agencies. This is the aspect of the Bill that they care more about than almost anything else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   This is a very sensitive issue. I have adopted two children in the past, although <P>


<a name="column_CWH72"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they are now grown up. I appreciate the fact that, as a parent, one does not want the unwanted interference of the local authority. Adoptive parents have taken the children as their own. However, one does want help when it is needed. A balance has to be struck, as some local authorities could be in the way.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para2"></a>How does the Bill relate to arrangements in Scotland? I do not know whether the Minister was in the House today, but there was a Question about the rather large number of Cabinet members from Scotland. I am a Scot, but I am living in England. It is quite possible that, when I adopted the children, I might have gone back to Scotland with them. Would the help be there regardless of whether I was living in England or Scotland? People move around, and an awful lot of Scots live in England. They cannot do without us.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para3"></a>My point is a serious one about the children. There are children who have needs, but sometimes those needs do not appear until they go to school. As anyone who has anything to do with a disability will know, one has to fight for any help that one gets. Indeed, one has to prise the help out of any authority, be it a health authority or a local authority. The matter must be dealt with sensitively, however, as we do not want to put disabled children into a pocket of segregation simply because they are adopted. The fact is that we want help for all children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   May I ask the noble Baroness to help me with this, if she would? She has raised the question of balance. I do not have the personal experience that she has, although I understand the question that she has raised. However, how is the question at all relevant to this amendment? It does not seem to me to be relevant to it. If it is, could she help?
<P>

<a name="20627-14_time0"></a><H5>4.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   Help needs to be there for all children, not simply for children who are adopted. Adopted children may have different needs, but the help should be there for all children. It will be pointed out, especially at school, that adopted children are adopted. It is very wise for parents to tell them that they are adopted; if not, other children will tell them so. The children also have to have extra support from their parent or parents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I rise to support Amendment No. 16. Before I do so, however, may I thank the Minister for his earlier assurance? As one person put it, the special aspect of adoption is that the adoptive parents make the commitment to keep that child in mind whether the child is there in their company or not. When we consider what support to give parents who have made that commitment to these children, we should bear in mind that they have given a unique and special gift to that child&#151;always to keep him or her in mind throughout his or her life.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para4"></a>I think that it was the noble Earl, Lord Howe, who pointed out that 20 per cent of adoptions break down. Adoption is no panacea. However, I am advised by <P>


<a name="column_CWH73"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Jeanne Kannuick, a senior researcher at Coram Family, that, with post-adoption support, that rate can be reduced by 10 per cent. That would reduce the number of children falling out from these families by 300.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para5"></a>My particular concern is about the increasing number of children with complex needs who are being adopted. As we know, because of the sometimes poor mental health and emotional well-being of these children, a lot of work often needs to be put into them. I cite one adopted girl, Louise, as an example. Quite shortly after her adoption, she was bullying her younger sisters. At one point, she tied a noose round one sister's neck and put the other end round the banister. She was harming herself and she was harming the other children. Another child, Kay, was adopted at four. By six, he was so violent towards his brothers that they had to have stitches. He was also swearing. He caused other problems that children sometimes cause such as stealing and lying.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para6"></a>Another girl was adopted last July, at age six. By Christmas, she was threatening to burn down the house and to kill her parents. These are not atypical problems. A person who is very experienced in this area said that about five per cent of adopted children present this sort of challenging behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para7"></a>It is therefore very important that the appropriate early intervention is made. That must follow on from the assessments which we have discussed, and it must be adequately resourced. I appreciate the Minister's earlier assurance, but I do not see how that early intervention will be made unless we have the reassurance that local authorities will have a duty to meet the assessed needs. I am particularly concerned that some of the needs here are so severe that they will require long-term interventions of a high quality, delivered by professionals. These are expensive and local authorities may seek cheaper, short-term measures. Listening to these families, they are saying that the real needs of these children were not addressed. There was no search to get to the roots of these children's problems and so, when they were taken to the families, the problems presented themselves. Six young girls last year were fine until their adolescence and then they presented to the service a terribly destructive behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para8"></a>I support the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   Clause 4 and the ancillary provisions probably represent one of the most important parts of the Bill. In determining how Clause 4, which provides for assessment and consequent provision of support services, should be finally drafted, I would invite the Minister to take into account four points.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para9"></a>The first is whether there should be a duty on a local authority to provide services once that authority has assessed them to be necessary. Common sense tells us that the adopted child has three requirements in his or her young life; those are, the adopted family, health and education. In education, we have a statutory duty upon local authorities to provide statements of <P>


<a name="column_CWH74"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>educational need for those children who require that support service. In health, we provide that care free as a statutory duty of the state and, in part, local authorities. If we consider it necessary that there should be adoption support services, and if in a particular case they are appropriate, how can it be said that there is no duty upon a local authority to provide them? It is simply inconsistent. The third element that the child needs, apart from health and education, is support to the family who are serving the community by adopting that child.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para10"></a>The first question is whether there should there be a duty. I hope that we will not descend to semantic analysis of the word, because the concept is important. The local authority should pay when it is necessary.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para11"></a>Secondly, I have to say&#151;and I hope that this is a constructive analysis&#151;Clause 4, at the moment, requires careful attention. Under Clause 4(4), which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where, as a result of an assessment, a local authority decide that a person has needs",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-14_para12"></a>
it must then decide whether to provide services. At subsections (6) and (7), regulations may be made about the assessments, plans and so on.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para13"></a>On its face, the clause provides two things in those subsections. The first is whether the local authority will or will not decide, without any criteria; and, secondly, the regulations as here phrased refer simply to methodology and not to principle. The net result would appear to be that, in this country, with the multiple collection of local authorities that we have, that if the clause stays as it now is in the final form of the Bill, three results would occur, or might occur. First, there would be no consistency between local authorities as to how they make their decision. Secondly, that would produce the risk of real injustice as to the provision or not of such services between one local authority and another. Thirdly, on its face, the clause would allow any local authority to refuse to provide support services simply by reference to resources. Common sense tells us that that will be the reason used by many local authorities when faced with an extra burden on their budget. Those results should be avoided and the Bill should cater for those risks.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para14"></a>The third problem I envisage, unless this clause is clarified more in our debates, is the risk of judicial review. This is not a legal point. When statements of educational need first became established, there was wholesale litigation as to how they should be applied to test for need on genuinely needy parents who wanted a just solution. The only remedy from confusion between their views and the local authority was to go to court. Heaven forbid that in a Bill like this we provide a vehicle for lawyers to spend a year or two debating whether a child should or should not have support services. What a dreadful additional burden for the family to have to suffer. That should not occur. The Bill and the regulations should guard against that necessity.

<a name="20627-14_para15"></a>The fourth and final point is cost. It is extremely difficult to estimate the cost of providing such support services, but the government service is well-equipped <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>to make estimates. It has plenty of material on which to assess what might be the ultimate cost and how that might be divided between local authorities, perhaps with central government's help.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para16"></a>It is almost certain, not only today but later, that the Minister will be driven to provide clear assessments about the cost to the state or local authorities, balanced against the cost if that provision is not made.
<P>

<a name="20627-14_para17"></a>I have risen with these suggestions in the hope that they may assist our debate, and the Minister, as we investigate Clause 4. This is not political as to party or sentiment, but it is to help human beings have a better life. I would have thought that the unity of sentiment which the Minister finds around him in this Committee will be reflected in the general public. I hope that my suggestions and others made will be taken into account to ensure that ultimately those children who are assessed as needing supporting services will receive them.

<A NAME="20627-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I find myself in some difficulty because with my deepest heart, I would like to support this duty. I was particularly taken by the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the clarity with which he talked about these children. However, I would like the Minister's assurance that if this duty is written into the Bill, we also have local authorities carrying out their duties to cared-for children, because Quality Protects had to be put in place to ensure that cared-for children had their needs met.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para0"></a>I would like to be assured that the needs of all those families who are statemented under the education provisions where there is a duty are met. I could list numbers of families where their needs are simply not met and where families live in frustration.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para1"></a>I would like to be assured that where families are at home and would like to keep their children, they are not faced with the situation of one young woman who said to me looking at her family who had been assisted with adoption, "If I had had that help, I would have been able to keep my own child at home". That duty should be there to ensure that people can keep their children, when they want to do so. I should like to be assured that the duty to meet the mental health needs of young people who are in adolescent units are properly met, so that they receive the kind of therapeutic care that was outlined earlier. I should like to see those duties, and all the others that we could list, carried through. I should like to be sure that children in need are properly identified, not just because the local authority believes they have the resources to meet that need.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para2"></a>If we ring fence this duty in some way, my real concern is that we shall have one gold-plated group of children. My great desire is to ensure that this level of service is there for every child in this country who faces need. All these children should receive the health support and education that my noble colleague mentioned, within the context of a good supportive <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>family. If I were looking at this and asking for funding, I should like to see it in the context of the whole needs of our children in this nation.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para3"></a>I talked to directors of social services earlier today. Their feeling is that the amount of funding going into children's service as a percentage of the whole in their local authorities has gone down over the years. I did not have the chance to check the reality of those figures and the Minister may wish to comment on that, but they certainly feel that they have less money available to meet children's needs despite the fact that the number of children in care is increasing, which, again, eats into vast amounts of the money that would be available in other circumstances. There is a real cost involved. I should love a duty to be placed in all these circumstances. I should also like to hear from the Minister what effect the duty in this situation would have on the duty in all of the others.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Understandably, this has been a very intense debate. I do not depart from anything that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said about the importance of getting adoption support right&#151;not, as he pointed out, after the child has been adopted, but right from the start of the process. The Bill, as presently drafted, allows not just for children who may be adopted, or adopted persons, but also for persons wishing to adopt a child.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para4"></a>Equally, I fully accept that there is very little point in having a statutory assessment process if, at the end of the day, the kind of support services that we wish to see provided are not available. I draw the Committee's attention to the consultation document that was issued last week, which contains a very useful table in Chapter 7 of the range of services that can be, and, indeed, are being provided by a number of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para5"></a>The problem with this debate is that I am very reluctant to go down the path of saying that one must place an absolute duty on local authorities to provide everything that is in the assessment. In asking some very pointed questions, the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, drew attention to the risk that one would actually put a duty to provide adoption support services at a higher level than applies to many other duties placed on local authorities. This, essentially, is the issue that the Government face.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para6"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and I have had the occasional exchange about who is more committed to decentralisation. Members of the Committee will know of my absolute commitment to decentralisation and sensitive performance management in health and local government. I genuinely believe that to be the right approach. I do believe in local government; it needs to have discretion to make its own decisions within a framework that ultimately ensures that the kind of support services that we all want to see are actually provided. The problem of a statutory duty, which Members of the Committee wish to see&#151;and I readily acknowledge the force of the argument being put forward today&#151;is that it would or could mean <P>


<a name="column_CWH77"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that adoption support services would be given priority over almost every other service provided by a local authority social services department. That in legislative terms is a problem. Of course, there is no point going down this road unless we can assure ourselves that local authorities will do the right thing.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para7"></a>I would say to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, in relation to the point she made right at the beginning, that it is clearly very important that the Bill places a duty on local authorities to make and participate in arrangements to provide adoption support services. It is our intent that this new duty will tackle the inconsistency that we can see at the moment in the availability of adoption support services including financial support. In addition, the Government's National Adoption Standards state clearly that children are entitled to support services to meet their assessed needs and that adopters will have access to a range of multi-agency support services before, during and after adoption.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para8"></a>Local authorities must of course act reasonably in deciding whether to provide adoption support services following an assessment. Failure to do so will be picked up through the monitoring and performance assessment that the department is engaged in and action will be taken accordingly. In addition, from April 2003 local authority adoption services will be independently inspected by the National Care Standards Commission in England and by the National Assembly for Wales. Subsection (4), however, makes clear that it is for the local authority to make a decision as to whether to provide adoption support services in each individual case and my noble friend Lord Brennan is right in saying that in doing so they may take the resources available to them into account. There is no real difference in that from the approach to the vast majority of public services, including other local authority services, or indeed the health service.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para9"></a>I recognise of course that the issue of resource availability is critical to the ability of local authorities to provide the required amount of services. We would expect the substantial amount of the extra £66 million announced in the White Paper to be used by local authorities to provide their adoption support services.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para10"></a>Overall, the duty to assess is a very important advance. Additional money has been made available. My noble friend Lord Brennan and other Members of the Committee made points in relation to the advantage for local authorities in investing more of their own resources in adoption support. Clearly the more they invest in those services the less likely demand will be on some of the intensive support programmes that are often required to be made available because adoption support was not available when it should have been. That, combined with National Adoption Standards and the performance management regime that we have in place, will ensure that we get adoption support services up to a high level. I would, however, be concerned if Members of the Committee insisted that we amended the Bill to make it an absolute duty for local authorities in every circumstance to have to provide all the services <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>identified through the assessment process, for the reason that I and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, made clear.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 would require local authorities, where they decide not to provide adoption support services, following an assessment under Clause 4, to provide a written explanation of their reasons for not doing so. I very much understand that, although I do not believe it is a matter for primary legislation. Clearly it will be good practice for local authorities to provide a written explanation of their reasons for not providing adoption support services following an assessment. However, we believe that is more appropriately covered in guidance to local authorities, and, as an example, in some cases depending of the needs of a person who is being assessed, it may be more appropriate to provide an oral explanation.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para12"></a>As I have previously explained, we are currently developing a new national framework for adoption support services and financial support in consultation with experts in the adoption field. The consultation document published on 21st June covered many of those points, and if following consultation we decide that it would be appropriate to provide a written explanation of their reasons, we will consider that and issue guidance to local authorities to that effect. However, I believe that if we were to do that we would then have to explore whether it should be provided in every case, or whether in certain circumstances. But we are prepared to consider that as part of the consultation.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para13"></a>Amendment No. 19 covers plans for the provision of adoption support services. The version of the Bill which we introduced in the previous Session did require local authorities in every case, where they decided to provide adoption support services, following an assessment to prepare a plan for the provision of those services, and to keep the plan under review. We gave that careful consideration and ultimately decided to make a change because we did not want to place unnecessary burdens on local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para14"></a>In many cases, where a local authority goes on to provide adoption support services following an assessment, it will be appropriate for it to draw up a plan to co-ordinate the provision of those services. Where an adoptive family are being provided with a number of different services following an assessment, the detail of those services will need to be recorded in a plan to ensure that the family receive the services provided at an appropriate time. However, in some cases a plan would not be needed; for instance, where services are being provided on a one-off basis such as an individual session of counselling for an adopted adult preparing to receive information about his or her birth family. A plan would not be necessary there to co-ordinate the provision of services.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para15"></a>We must be proportionate here. We must avoid placing unnecessary burdens on local authorities when we want them to focus on the critical issues that make adoption successful.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para16"></a>Amendment No. 20 is linked to the preparation of plans. It would require local authorities to draw up a plan in prescribed circumstances where they have assessed a need to provide adoption support services. There is no indication in the amendment whether the prescribed circumstances for the preparation of a plan are to be the same as those intended by the Government, or whether they are to be different. The key feature of the amendment is that it links a requirement to produce a plan with an assessment of need for adoption support services.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para17"></a>As I explained earlier, the Government's desire is that local authorities will have discretion to determine whether to provide adoption support services following an assessment of need. There may be cases where a local authority assesses a need to provide adoption support services, but does not go on to provide those services. I have already made it clear that the local authority must act reasonably in determining whether to provide services. However, just purely as a sensible administrative approach to that, where it determines not to provide adoption support services, it does not seem appropriate for it to draw up a plan for the provision of those services.
<P>

<a name="20627-15_para18"></a>Amendment No. 21 would enable regulations to provide for review of a local authority's decision not to provide adoption support services. I believe that that situation best rests with the local authority's complaints system. Where it decided not to provide adoption support services, following an assessment of needs, and those affected are dissatisfied, a complaint may be made to the local authority in the usual way. Adoption is a mainstream social service responsibility, and I believe that the majority of complaints about local authority adoption services should therefore fall appropriately to be dealt with through their existing complaints procedure.

<a name="20627-15_para19"></a>We are currently improving the local authority social services complaints procedure to speed it up, especially for children. We undertook a review of social services complaints procedures&#151;

Where he says he is placing an obligation on the local authority to act reasonably, does that mean "reasonably" in an absolute sense or "reasonably" in relation to its available resources?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   "Reasonably" must embrace the issue of resources. There cannot be any getting away from that. If one thinks of the National Health Service, in relation to its general duty to provide services to the people of this country, clearly the ability of statutory services to provide those resources is always going to be a factor. We cannot run away from that issue.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para0"></a>The challenge for government and local authorities is to ensure that they invest sufficient resources in adoption support services. I have already indicated <P>


<a name="column_CWH80"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that much of the additional money that we have put in will go towards adoption support. We know that local authorities have increased their own resource investment in the adoption service. I hope that that will continue. The assessment that local authorities will be required to carry out is a very important advance, and as I have already said, there would be little point going down this route unless we were ultimately satisfied that local authorities were able to provide a consistent range of services that are required.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para1"></a>As we will no doubt consider this again between now and the Report stage, I urge Members of the Committee to consider whether it would be right to put an absolute duty on local authorities to provide every single service in all circumstances which they may have assessed&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I am obliged to the Minister for giving way. It is not really a question of "reasonableness". The question of "reasonableness" arises where the local authority decides not to provide services. I have been involved in these cases, but I have never been involved in a case where it did decide to provide them. Now, if it decided to provide them, the question of "reasonableness" simply would not arise. The decision has been made to provide them. Resources, by judicial decision, are not relevant to say, "We couldn't do it because, although we decided we didn't have the resources". It has been held by the court in more than one case that that will not wash.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para2"></a>Therefore, the decision has been made which does not have to be made. However, if a local authority decides to provide the services, I cannot understand the argument why they should not be provided and why there is no duty. It does not have to make the decision, but if it is made, it has to be implemented.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   One can see quite clearly what would happen in that case. The assessment would become the rationer of services. Clearly, their assessment would inevitably be constrained. The answer that I was trying to give the noble Earl, Lord Russell, was that one cannot surely deny in the end that resources are a factor and always will be for responsible public authorities. However, we are trying to get a proper assessment process in place and a high quality range of services.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para3"></a>I know that there are arguments about the current performance of local authorities and that the history and record over many years in relation to adoption services and adoption support services has not been an altogether happy one. There has been an inconsistent approach, but as I said earlier, there is evidence that since the publication of the PIU report and the White Paper local authorities have begun to get their act together. They have invested more resources; we are seeing more children adopted and I know from the reporting mechanism of the Social Services Inspectorate that SSI inspectors, too, are picking up definite indicators of improved services and performance.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para4"></a>The enactment of the legislation, the adoption standards, the consultation that we are undertaking and the preparation will lead to a much enhanced <P>


<a name="column_CWH81"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>service, which we shall rigorously monitor through the performance of management arrangements and through the role of the National Care Standards Commission in the regulation of these functions. That is the best way to move forward.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para5"></a>The provision of a right of assessment for the categories of persons listed is a major advance. The local authorities must be given some discretion, very much hedged in by the kind of performance management assessment that we have in place. I question whether a statutory duty in relation to the provision of adoption support services would be right. Inevitably it could be seen to give priority for adoption support services over nearly every other function provided by the local authority social services department.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para6"></a>I recognise that this will be the subject of continuing debate. I am happy to meet Members of the Committee between now and Report to discuss the matter further. I hope that they will recognise that the Government are seeking to be reasonable in ensuring high quality support services, also recognising that the local authority must have some discretion.

<A NAME="20627-16_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   The Minister did not answer my question about Scotland. I now want to ask him about Northern Ireland as well, since he mentioned England and Wales again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   This Bill largely relates to England and Wales, although it contains provisions particularly about recognition of adoptions in each country. I understand that in Scotland they are considering undertaking a review of their own adoption arrangements. Northern Ireland may be doing so, but they are not so far advanced in their deliberations.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para7"></a>The provisions that we are talking about in relation to adoption support services would apply to adopted children living in England. If they were in Scotland, the provisions of the Scottish legislation would apply. We will continue to work closely with our colleagues in the devolved Administrations to make sure that it is as clear as possible to adoptive parents as to the different circumstances in which they find themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   The Minister said that the Government would be monitoring closely the workings of the support services. If the Government then find that they are not satisfied with the way that they are working, what can they do about it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   There are a number of mechanisms that the Department of Health can use to intervene in local authorities' performance, if we are dissatisfied with the way that they perform; for example, there is the role of the Social Services Inspectorate in drawing to the attention of local authorities weaknesses in their performance. In addition, a fairly short time ago we launched performance ratings for local authority social services <P>


<a name="column_CWH82"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>departments, which gave a very clear indication to the public and to counsellors in those authorities as to whether a local authority was doing well, or badly.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para8"></a>We also have other direct intervention powers. At the end of the day, we can take the responsibility for services away from a local authority. In addition, its adoption service will require to be regulated in the circumstances that I described under the National Care Standards Commission. Whatever else people may say, I do not believe local authorities are in any doubt that we have the power to intervene.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-16_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   This has been an extremely helpful and useful debate. After some considerable time we heard the exact word that we needed to hear when the Minister used the word "evidence". I highlight that because I came to this subject completely afresh. I did not know what post-adoption support was; I really did not know what people meant by it. When people started to explain it to me and explained that it would make a tangible difference, my first question was: how do you know?
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para9"></a>We have established that the evidence, for any argument on any side, is pretty thin. That is most effectively demonstrated in the consultation document that the Government provided last week. I should like to pick up some of the points raised by the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, about the difference&#151;and distinction&#151;between post-adoption services and services for other children.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para10"></a>Members of the Committee may not have the consultation document to hand, but pages 22 and 23 set out the existing duties of local authorities and of other authorities under the Children Act. There is a range of duties that are already in place for general children's services. However, if one turns to page 27 of the document and considers what the Minister said as regards the evidence from recent social services inspections, one sees a long list of points on why many of the current adoption services do not work. It is a very strange consultation document, with very few figures in it&#151;a fact which puzzles me. It has become evident to me that one of the reasons is that there is no tracking or monitoring mechanism for what happens when an adoption goes wrong. There is also no tracking or monitoring of what happens when they go well, and when adoption support is provided.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para11"></a>We are all arguing very much in the dark here. This is why some of us have homed in on the question of assessment. The Minister talked about the distinction between assessment and assessments made in the light of resources. My noble friend Earl Russell and I immediately thought of the Gloucestershire judgment&#151;those are the words that will ring in his ear on that particular subject.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para12"></a>The Government, in this Bill, have said "We will give you the right to an assessment, and because that assessment is in no way bound to be provision-related, it will be a very pure assessment". Therefore, a person who receives an assessment for post-adoption support will have a "perfect&#151;I repeat, "perfect"&#151;assessment of his adoption. He will not get that from his local authority, so perhaps he could get it somewhere else.
<P>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para13"></a>I ask the Minister this: how will local authorities make assessments for something which may never exist? Part of an assessment process has to consider whether a person will get benefit from a post-adoption service. If that post-adoption service never exists, how do you build up an assessment on it? There is something illogical in this; something incomplete. That is why some of us have chosen to focus our amendments on what happens when assessments are carried out but no provision is made.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para14"></a>I believe people when they tell me&#151;I refer Members of the Committee back to Clause 1(4)(a) and (b) and to the fact that we are dealing with the needs of a person throughout his life&#151;that the problems which adopted children have are not unique; other children have those same problems. But they are unique as regards the way that they happen in the case of adopted children and adoptive families. So there is a special need there.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para15"></a>I also have a question. It is a question, for the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, as well as for the Minister. Does a post-adoption service have to be absolutely isolated from all other functions of a social services department? I do not believe that it does. Mental health services, family counselling and so on are services that need to exist for all families.
<P>

<a name="20627-16_para16"></a>We have talked about other pieces of legislation, the Education Bill and so on. We are not seeking in this Bill to put adopted children and adoptive families at some higher level of need than anybody else; we are trying to make sure that the right services exist. If they exist for adoptive families and children, then other people who have those same needs can access them. That is the point here.

<A NAME="20627-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I must intervene. Of course, I fully understand the point the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is raising. Does she, however, not see the argument that I am putting forward? It would not work like that. Because you are imposing such a strong duty in relation to adoption support services&#151;a stronger duty than in the case of almost any other provision by a local authority social services department&#151;it would not work in the way the noble Baroness suggests. It would work the other way. That is the genuine problem here. There is no argument in principle here between all Members of the Committee. There is no point going down this route unless we can ensure that adoption support services are provided effectively to all who need them.

<A NAME="20627-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I put the contrary point to the Minister. No matter which piece of legislation one is assessed under, one is going to be assessed for something one is not going to get because it is not going to exist. That is the problem.

The consultation paper makes clear that already, without that extra money, local authorities are putting more resource in themselves because increasingly they recognise that they have to sort out adoption services. They know that you need good adoption support services to make the thing work. They know we are going to regulate them. They know we are going to have strong performance assessment. We are not going to end up in a position where people are not going to get decent adoption support services. Why else would we place a statutory assessment duty on the face of the Bill?

I cannot tell the noble Lord how delighted I am to see it now when we are able to discuss it.

<a name="20627-17_para0"></a>I go back to the point about evidence and reiterate my question to the noble Lord about tracking. I believe that Members on all sides of the Committee are seeking to do not only that which is best but also that which is&#151;if I dare say it&#151;fiscally prudent. However, we are all hampered by the lack of evidence.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para1"></a>I want to deal with a couple of specific points which the Minister raised. First, on Amendment No. 19, the Minister talked about the necessity not to have a plan. He said that a plan may apply only to a one-off episode. I believe that this is part of the deal&#151;the more there is in regulations, the more individual people who are likely to be affected by legislation should have the right to see things in writing. That relates to all areas of legislation.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para2"></a>Secondly, Amendment No. 21 concerns local authority complaints procedures. We will come to this in a later debate. No matter how good a local authority complaints procedure may be, the complaint is made to the same authority working with the same ethos, the same policies and, critically, the same financial situation.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para3"></a>I mentioned a local authority that happens to be run by my party at the moment. What would someone in the London Borough of Lambeth do when it has to cut £9 million this year from its social services budget? What is the point of having a complaints procedure that enables someone to go back only to meet with the same set of factors that they have met with before? That is wrong.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para4"></a>I refer to two further points. There is a lack of data here. Who knows what is going on? Who knows what is happening and not happening? The noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred in his opening statement to a long list of organisations which have differing views on just about every aspect of the Bill. But, as one, they tell us, first, that this is not happening, secondly, that it should <P>


<a name="column_CWH85"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>happen, and, thirdly, that if it does happen, it will make a reality of many of the items in the Government's wish list.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para5"></a>Finally, why do we want to put this measure on the face of the Bill as opposed to leaving it to regulations and local authority guidance? There is one crucial reason why we have to do that. Here I refer to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan. He talked about what happened when statementing and educational needs came in. In a way that I would not dare, he talked about his own legal profession. However, there was a crucial difference there. Individual people have a right, because of legislation, to argue the case for something to happen. It is not about local authorities deciding whether or not they react to government guidance; it is about individual people having a power. That is why, taken together, the amendments&#151;perhaps they are not correct in every detail; I accept that&#151;should be just cause for the Government to go away and think again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-17_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I have not yet worked out whether one stands up when one's name is mentioned. I am still learning all these procedures. I have a few points to make. First, I am a Cross-Bencher. I am delighted to be put alongside the Minister, but what I say is from my own experience, not from any political background, and I should make that absolutely clear.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para6"></a>I agree with the points that have been made. I said that I would like to see a duty in all these areas. I have great concerns that if we place a duty on one and not on the others, we will get this terrible imbalance. The noble Baroness made the point that what we really need to work towards&#151;and I believe the Government are attempting this&#151;is integrated services, so that all these issues can come together, and the service can benefit all the children who need them, not just one group of children.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para7"></a>I also want to make the point about the way an assessment takes place. I want to see the best assessments, recommending the best services. I have been in situations when that has happened over the years, but one cannot provide that. One cannot provide it because rationing means those resources are not only not available because of costs, but because there may be some psychiatric care which one cannot obtain, or because the waiting lists are so long.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para8"></a>Many of the problems are with the health service. Many of the children need special health service care, or special educational care, which simply are not there. I would not want an assessment to be a statutory duty, which one could not then make best endeavours in relation to that child. Those best endeavours might not be the top of the list, but I would not like to lose those at the top list because we desperately need research. We need research which says, "What did these children need? What did they get? What were the outcomes?" If we had that, then we would be in a better position to know, again, what is best for all children, not just this group of children.

<a name="20627-17_para9"></a>I felt I should respond. I hope that is the appropriate way to do it and I shall keep trying.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   I thank the Minister for the way in which he has dealt with all the comments. No sensible person is going to invite the Government to give a blank cheque to local authorities; that is absurd. The proposition as put raises two questions that I would invite him to consider. The proposition is: upon what basis should an assessment be carried out whether or not a provision is made&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brougham and Vaux): </B>  Can the noble Lord speak up?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brennan: </B>   Yes. Secondly, what are the criteria to be used once the local authority determines that it is a proper case in which to make provision? Can it or not?
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para10"></a>I was very reassured to hear from my noble friend that he thought a local authority must act reasonably in making the first decision on whether the child should receive support services. However, my question is: against what criteria? Reasonableness has to be objective and not idiosyncratic from local authority to local authority, so where would those criteria come from?
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para11"></a>My second question is: in the circumstance in which a local authority would like to give provision but for various reasons it cannot justify that, what criteria will then apply? What will the performance monitoring group use as the standards against which to decide whether the local authority has acted sensibly and in the public interest?
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para12"></a>I am reassured by the progress we have made in terms of "reasonableness" in relation to local authority action, but I invite the Minister to consider&#151;not today but later&#151;whether we can go a step further and decide what the criteria are.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I was a little disturbed by what seemed to be a rather cavalier attitude on the part of the Minister, who is not normally cavalier, towards written papers. We have done our best to suggest that at various points records should be kept&#151;a written reason for not providing services, a written plan which is kept under review, and so on. He seemed to suggest that that was demanding too much.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para13"></a>I am a member of a probation board, and some of the children&#151;unfortunately the sort of children we are talking about&#151;may well pass from the social services direct to the probation board. When that happens, every single action that the probation service takes in respect of those children has to be recorded. That record is the record of what the service has done, and on that record it is judged. The record also provides the evidence for the national performance of the service and its success in serving the courts and so on.
<P>

<a name="20627-17_para14"></a>I see no reason why another service, dealing with the same or similar young people who have suffered the same or similar traumatic events in their youth, should not be under the same obligation to make a record of <P>


<a name="column_CWH87"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what it does, and when and why it does it. Such a record also provides evidence for what is happening in the service as a whole and what causes success and failure. Similarly, in the health service we spend a great deal of time asking ourselves which treatments have been successful, what their cost was and how they performed as compared with those that have not been so successful, their costs and so on.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-18_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I heard Professor Al Ainsley Green, who is leading the Children's Framework, make a final point that policy towards children should be evidence-based. He also made the point that more and more we are looking at the journey of the child. Both those points are relevant to what the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has just said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I suspect that we are at cross purposes. I fully recognise that the local authority needs to keep appropriate records for the reasons raised in relation to judicial review&#151;which we hope will not be a frequent occurrence, although I noted the comments of my noble friend&#151;or if a person seeks to use the complaints procedure. A local authority will need to keep records. My comments were specifically in relation to the actual wording of the amendment: I suggested that there might be circumstances where it would not be essential for the local authority to provide a written plan, particularly when a one-off service was being provided. However, a written plan is different from keeping a proper record of any decision taken. That is the point that I was trying to make.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para0"></a>More generally, on the issue of outcome evidence and tracking through how well the new system will proceed, I recognise that important point. The department is funding research on both the cost and outcomes of adoption and I hope it will be of use to all of us in the future and to local authorities in particular. It is worth saying that the White Paper committed the Government to working on how to develop better systems of monitoring the outcome of adoptions, but to do so in a sensitive way without being intrusive in relation to the families concerned. We shall continue to work on that basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-18_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I had expected this to be a debate of some importance and how right I was. We have made progress today. These exchanges have been extremely useful and I thank all Members of the Committee and the right reverend Prelate for taking part.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para1"></a>In conclusion, I thank the Minister for the way in which he was able to concur with the central premise of the case that I tried to lay out; namely, the critical importance of adoption services for families, of early preparation and the cost to society if services are not <P>


<a name="column_CWH88"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provided when they are needed. I know that the Minister understands the strength of the case made today. Indeed, I take some heart from the fact that he did not chide me too hard. In fact, he did not chide me at all, as he usually does, on attempting to place a duty of this kind on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para2"></a>In a sense, the Minister made the case for me. If councils are to have discretion not to provide adoption services, what is the point of requiring them to provide an assessment? Why should they be legally obliged to incur the cost of assessments if they are not then going to spend money on the support services? There is a lack of logic there. The Minister said that in his view local authorities know what is in the air, what is expected of them, and what they are going to have to do. I wonder about that. All the evidence at the moment is that there are some local authorities providing very good support services, but also that there are others which simply do not and show no signs of doing so.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para3"></a>I wonder whether the Government themselves went through the sort of thought processes that this Committee has gone through and then backtracked along the way. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, usefully drew our attention to what the Government said in their White Paper Adoption: A New Approach. I shall read out a bit of it again. Paragraph 6.27 says that new legislation would be introduced to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"place a clear duty on local social services authorities to provide post-adoption support, including financial support, planned jointly with local education authorities and the NHS, and any other relevant agencies. This support will be available from the time a placement is made, for as long as it is needed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-18_para4"></a>
The language there is quite plain. I read that as a commitment to provide post-adoption support, and to impose a clear duty to provide that support. The White Paper did not say that local authorities would be given a duty to decide whether or not to provide post-adoption support.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para5"></a>Therefore, if the Government continue to resist these amendments in later stages of the Bill, they will seem to have resiled from the commitment in their own White Paper. Unless local authorities are obliged to provide adoption support to those who meet the assessment criteria, there is, as I said, a distinct risk that many of them will offer the barest of skeleton services, simply to comply with the letter of the law. I am not at all sure about the Minister's remarks about the triumph of enlightened self-interest on the part of local authorities. The reality is that when the budgetary climate is tough, local authorities will concentrate their resources on their statutory duties and cut down on the functions which they do not legally have to provide.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Does that not give substance to my argument that one needs to be cautious before pursuing an option which, in effect, would say that adoption support service provision is a higher responsibility than almost any other provision by a local authority social services department? Does the noble Earl not recognise that there is some merit in at least debating whether that is ultimately a sensible option?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-18_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Of course I recognise the merit of that. I think that we owe that point particularly to the noble <P>


<a name="column_CWH89"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness, Lady Howarth, and to the Minister. Ring fencing is a problematic issue; it always has been and always will be. This is ring fencing in another sense. It is not ring fencing of a budget but ring fencing of duties, which has an impact on everything else. Of course I understand that. However, to the extent that that is so, I should have thought that it was attributable to a shortage of both trained professionals and of money.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para6"></a>We come back to the money question, which was highlighted particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan. No one on this side of the Committee&#151;or at least in this corner of the Committee&#151;would be in favour of issuing a blank cheque to local authorities. We are as much in favour of prudence as is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, the ability of local authorities to provide these services will depend critically on the resources that they receive from central government. This is ultimately an element of the PSS budget. To the extent that they cannot provide the services, it is a reflection of lack of provision of money from the centre. That is perhaps a point upon which we need to reflect between now and Report. We are looking at a resources issue.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para7"></a>There is no doubt that there is a gap in the centre of this clause. Local authorities are being given a duty to provide an assessment where it is requested. They are being given a duty to decide to make a decision on the basis of that assessment. There is a duty, as we heard, to exercise reasonableness in coming to that decision. The noble Lord, Lord Brennan, shed some very helpful light on the question of reasonableness. We heard from the Minister that reasonableness can take account of the question of resources.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para8"></a>I am fearful about the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, about judicial review, if we focus on this question of reasonableness. There could be severe risks that, once a local authority has decided that services are required on the basis of an assessment properly carried out, but then fails to provide those services because of a lack of resources, then we could be in dangerous waters.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para9"></a>I do not see performance management as a substitute for this duty, not least because performance management&#151;by definition&#151;tends to be exercised long after the identification of need, and real families and real children will have suffered in the interim. While I do not belittle performance management, which is an extremely important area, I am not persuaded that it is a substitute for this duty.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para10"></a>We have spent a good deal of time on this issue and it is time to move on. I again thank all noble Lords who have taken part, and I thank the Minister for his very thoughtful words. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20627-18_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 23, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 26. These are both small amendments, but they are strengthening amendments in relation to Clause 4(9). They strengthen the requirements on the health authority, the primary care trust and the LEA.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para15"></a>Amendment No. 23 imposes a commitment on the three bodies in addition to those provided for in the Bill. It also further involves them by requesting their help. It is a practical amendment which asks for assistance, and I hope that it will become a practical part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para16"></a>Amendment No. 26 commits the above-mentioned bodies&#151;the health authorities, primary care trusts and local authorities&#151;to action. The Bill refers to "notification". However, notification is one thing, but action is another. As written, Clause 4(9)(b) seems to say that the bodies could "note" but not actually ask for action on information received. I believe that these amendments would make it clear beyond doubt exactly what we are asking of these bodies. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="20627-18_para17"></a>In the Bill, there is a duty on the local authority to notify health authorities, PCTs or the local education authority. As the noble Baroness said, there is no duty on those bodies to provide health or education services. Even if they believe they should provide those services, they may decide not to.
<P>

<a name="20627-18_para18"></a>There is no point in simple notification without a duty to provide the services that a thorough assessment has declared vital to the progress of the child. There is a requirement in education that if a child is statemented, his assessed needs must be met. We feel that the same should apply to health and education under the Bill.

<A NAME="20627-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   Our amendment in this series is very similar to the others; it is almost identical to Amendment No. 24. The purpose of the amendments is quite clear to everyone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   We debated similar amendments on Monday. Members of the Committee will recall that I agreed to look at the form of any guidance we give to local authorities, LEAs and the NHS, particularly picking up the point that was made on Monday about the need for co-ordination when the local authority providing an adoption service, the LEA and the NHS have statutory responsibilities. The clear point is making sure that there is co-ordination. On Monday, I said that I would look at the guidance to ensure that we picked up this issue of co-ordination.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH91"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para0"></a>I recognise that these amendments raise a number of particular issues that we need to consider. If I can first say to my noble friend Lady Gibson that I want to reassure her about what I understand the word "notification" to mean. The point is that health authorities, primary care trusts and local education authorities must act reasonably in the exercise of their functions. They have statutory responsibilities and they would not be in a position to ignore or overlook such notifications from local social service authorities. They could not simply receive a notification and place it in a file. They would have to give due consideration to it. That is their responsibility as providers of statutory services.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para1"></a>In addition, education and health providers will of course be aware that services needed to support an adoptive placement are likely to be less intensive than those that would be needed if the child were in the looked-after system.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para2"></a>I know that in our last debate, doubt was cast upon that good old principle of enlightened self-interest. I am certain that the responsibility of the local authority to notify if it appears to it that provision of services is needed from the health authority, the LEA or primary care trust, with the guidance that we are going to issue as to how that will work, will be abundantly clear. It will be clear to the LEA and to the NHS that it is in everyone's interest that they work together to ensure that appropriate services are provided.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 also address the role of health and education authorities in the provision of adoption support services. These amendments would place a duty on health bodies and local education authorities, following receipt of a notification from a local authority, to provide any relevant service.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para4"></a>I have made it clear that the NHS and the LEA will need to determine whether to provide such adoption support services in accordance with their statutory provision. I have to stress again, however, as I did on Monday, that it would not be sensible to reach a position where the assessment for adoption support services provided under Clause 4 of the Bill overrode the responsibility of the NHS and the LEA to provide the statutory duties that they have to provide.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para5"></a>Naturally, where a health authority, a primary care trust, or an LEA decides to provide services following such notification, it would be good practice for it to inform the local social services authority. This would give the local social services authority a clear picture of the package of adoption support services being provided to an individual and help ensure the joined-up planning and provision of public services. I have listened to that particular argument and can assure Members of the Committee that we shall issue guidance and directions to LEAs and the NHS to that effect. I also give assurance that National Adoption Standards state that councils will plan and deliver <P>


<a name="column_CWH92"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adoption services with local health and education bodies. The use of guidance and directions will help to deliver that standard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-19_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   On a very specific point, the perception of adoption services tends to be that the service provided by CAMHS is not as effective often as one not provided by CAMHS&#151;the sort of psychotherapeutic approach with the children that we are talking about here. It is a particular point, therefore, and I hope the Minister will not mind me raising it here.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para6"></a>It is important that the right intervention is made; that is what I am trying to get across. Can the Minister explain, therefore, how, if the normal CAMHS approach, which tends to be a cognitive approach with a short intervention to address particular symptoms and with a short piece of behavioural treatment, is not thought to be appropriate, a different approach, which is more long term, often talk therapy that looks at the roots of a child's problem and tries to address them maybe over a number of years, might be brought in and worked?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I suppose, first, that the very fact that statutory assessment needs to take place would allow for discussion between the local authorities and the individual or parents who have asked for such an assessment to discuss the range of options on offer. That would be the first point at which to discuss it.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para7"></a>If, as a result of those discussions and the assessment, the local authority considered that the NHS would be able to provide such services, the health service would receive notification under Clause 4(9)(a) and the local health service would then need to consider what further action it might take. That might in itself involve a discussion with the applicants who have received the assessment in which the range of options would be put before them.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para8"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, then took the matter into a much wider debate, not for the first time, and I recognise what he said about the value of "talking therapies". I would hope that that would be a matter that the local NHS would consider. He also raised the question of the effectiveness of the adolescent mental health service. He will know that there is much to be done in improving those services, including co-ordinating the work between health and social services. He mentioned Al Ainsley Green very recently, our Children's Czar, if I may put it like that. We are developing the Children's National Service Framework and we are looking at the kind of service that is provided in that context. I cannot give a simple answer to the noble Earl but I hope he will recognise that, through the assessment process, through the notification, then through the NHS making its own determination, there are opportunities to provide a full range of services. However, I do not pretend that ensuring effective services is anything but a very great challenge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   I thank my noble friend the Minister for his explanation of the term <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>"notification". Perhaps I could ask something about the guidance to which he has referred. It strikes me that there should be some kind of monitoring of what is actually happening. Guidance is fine&#151;but. Will there be a reference to monitoring in the guidance, or if not, will there be some other form of monitoring what is happening?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My noble friend is absolutely right. We come back to the previous debate about assessments and how we can make sure that this system works effectively. I can assure my noble friend that as regards our overall performance management of the new adoption service, issues in relation to co-ordination between the local statutory agencies will clearly need to be factored into that assessment process. As far as the NHS is concerned, the Department of Health has direct performance management mechanisms in place for the National Health Service. We will want to see a joined-up approach put in place.

<a name="20627-19_para11"></a><P>

"( ) A statutory instrument containing regulations under this section is not to be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-19_para12"></a>The noble Earl said: We have had a good debate on the substantive points at issue in this clause and I do not want to draw out our proceedings unduly. However, Amendment No. 27 reflects the broader concern that I have about the importance of the subject matter in Clause 4&#151;a point which has already been echoed by many noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para13"></a>How Clause 4 will actually work out in practice is, to a very great extent, dependent on regulations yet to be drafted. The criteria to be set down as to who is entitled to an assessment, in what circumstances they are entitled to it, what factors should govern a local authority's deliberations as they carry out an assessment, and so on&#151;all these things are not yet known, yet they are of critical importance.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para14"></a>I always regret the absence of draft regulations when a Bill is being debated but this is a particularly glaring example of the Committee having to fly blind, as it were. We need to see what the Government are planning to put into the regulations before we can make a balanced judgment about this part of the Bill. That is why I have tabled this amendment. As we are <P>


<a name="column_CWH94"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not aware of what the regulations will contain, it is not unreasonable for us to ask that both Houses should have an automatic right to debate them when they are laid.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para15"></a>However, regardless of that&#151;I expect the Minister to take issue with me on this point&#151;it would be most helpful if he could go a little further than he has so far been able to do about the content of the regulations, in particular about the assessments themselves, how they are going to be done, how the plans are to be drawn up, and how these are to be reviewed. What is meant by conditional support in subsection (7)(f)? I believe that it relates to reimbursement and that there is some financial implication to it, but I am not certain.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para16"></a>Our earlier debate on the issue of connected persons gave rise to a number of questions about who will be able to request an assessment on behalf of whom. The Minister has already made a number of helpful comments there, but if he could enlarge on that it would be useful. There are cross-boundary issues that need to be thought through. There is the interaction between health, education and social services. All these are pivotal to the success of the Government's plans, which of course we very much want to see working properly.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para17"></a>The other implication of subsections (6) and (7) is resources. I realise that these are not strictly relevant to the content of the regulations themselves, but, as we were debating earlier, they are a vitally necessary accompaniment to them. The more that we require of local authorities in the way that they are told to carry out assessments, plans, reviews and so on, the more they are entitled to plead for the wherewithal with which to do it all.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para18"></a>In particular, many local authorities will be short of the necessary skilled manpower. I understand that the vacancy rate in some social services children's departments is as high as 50 per cent in parts of London. The Minister may not be able to say anything now, but it would be helpful if at some point he could comment on how that situation is to be ameliorated. Without professional trained staff, we can legislate all we like, but we shall not improve the situation on the ground by one iota.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para19"></a>I hope that the Minister will feel sympathetic to the motivation which has led me to move this amendment. If he can shed some light on the particular issues to which I referred, I should be grateful. I beg to move.

We have taken great interest and worked with our local government colleagues on the matter. I should be happy to give more details to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and perhaps write to him about some of the initiatives taken. Clearly these are important. Last autumn, we launched a series of initiatives at the social services conference which I hope are beginning to bear fruit.

<FONT SIZE=3>and can be recouped if not so spent. It might be appropriate where a one-off grant is being paid for a specific purpose, but is unlikely to be used for regular allowances.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para21"></a>In terms of the parliamentary procedure to be adopted under the Bill, we have sought to follow established practice. All regulations made under the Adoption Act 1976 are subject to the negative resolution procedure except for those made under Section 3(1), which are not subject to any procedure. We therefore believe that the vast majority of regulations made under the Adoption and Children Bill should also be subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para22"></a>A memorandum was sent to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee when the Bill was introduced in this House. The Committee reported that the powers are appropriately delegated and that the provisions for parliamentary scrutiny are appropriate. Given the number of times that noble Lords in this Committee have recently prayed against Department of Health regulations, I do not believe that the use of negative resolutions is inappropriate. I am sure that we shall have happy hours debating those regulations when they come before us.
<P>

<a name="20627-19_para23"></a>The noble Earl asked about the details and the timetable. The consultation paper that we published last week sets out some of the issues on which we are consulting. That consultation will inform the regulations and help to address some of the issues which he raised on the criteria to be adopted. The aim is to discuss the draft guidelines and regulations with stakeholder groups in October&#150;November 2002 in the light of the consultation. We hope to publish the framework and draft regulations and guidance for public consultation towards the end of the year. We aim then to finalise regulations and issue them, with guidance, early in 2003. That is important because we need to allow sufficient time for those who have to implement the new approach from 2004. They must have time to prepare the ground for that.

<P>

<a name="20627-20_para0"></a>I realise that the Delegated Powers Committee of your Lordships' House has declared that the procedure in the Bill is appropriate. My concern is that the other place does not always have an opportunity to debate negative instruments. We in your Lordships' House have that privilege if we wish to insist upon it. Members of Parliament, for reasons that I need not explain, do not necessarily have that privilege. I am sure that when the regulations are laid we shall wish to pay close attention to them and debate them.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 3, after third "of" insert "professional"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-20_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20627-20_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a simple amendment which I hope will find favour with the Committee. Clause 8 defines what is meant by an adoption support agency. As I have said before, those of us who come to this subject afresh have been delighted, not to say bewildered, to meet the variety of organisations that work in this field.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para10"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to draw a distinction between bodies that provide regulated services under this Bill and previous adoption Bills, and the many voluntary&#151;truly voluntary&#151;organisations, and self-help organisations, which provide invaluable support but which perhaps in many cases are of a wholly voluntary nature with no staff nor, indeed, vast resources. Clearly, therefore, they should not come within the scope of this Bill and within what we are in no doubt will be a very heavy and demanding regulatory framework.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para11"></a>As Members of the Committee would expect, coming from my professional background I very much believe in the encouragement and development of voluntary sector activities. That is important, as is the quality that such organisations bring to this sort of work. It would be a shame if, almost inadvertently, we were to inhibit that valuable work from continuing by wrongly including them in this legislation.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para12"></a>At the same time, it is wholly clear within this Bill that there is a demarcation between what a voluntary organisation should do and what a voluntary adoption agency, providing regulated services, is. There should not be any confusion in that respect. That is why I have tabled the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness because I agree with what she says. It is important to make sure that we are clear as to who will be covered by the regulatory process, and who will not be. I fully recognise the value of voluntary groups in this area; and, indeed, self-help groups that carry out enormously valuable work. As far as concerns the wording, subsection (1) of Clause 8 makes it clear that an adoption support agency is an undertaking. The term "undertaking" has the same meaning as Section 121 of the Care Standards Act 2000. It includes any business or profession, whether voluntary or profit making, but does not extend, for example, to a self-help group meeting in a person's own home.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH97"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para13"></a>In line with this definition, an adoption support agency may be a voluntary or profit-making undertaking, and either an organisation or a sole practitioner. Adoption support providers that are not currently subject to any form of inspection or regulation, such as post-adoption support centres and independent counsellors providing adoption support services, will be required to register as adoption support agencies.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para14"></a>Adoption support providers that are already regulated through other means, such as approved voluntary adoption agencies, NHS providers and the registrar-general, will be exempt from the requirement to register as an adoption support agency. In so doing, we are hoping to avoid unnecessary duplication of registration. The providers who are exempt from the requirement to register are listed at subsection (2)(a) to (e) of Clause 8.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para15"></a>Subsection (2)(f) of Clause 8 provides a power to make regulations to add to the list of adoption support providers that are not obliged to register as adoption support agencies. We will make regulations under this provision if we believe that other adoption support providers should be exempt from the requirement to register, where these providers are regulated through other means. We will use this power to avoid duplication of registration if such duplication comes to light.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para16"></a>The amendment amends the definition of an "adoption support agency" in subsection (1) of Clause 8. It provides that an adoption support agency is an undertaking which provides professional adoption support services. While, alas, the term "professional" is not defined by the noble Baroness, it is obviously intended to capture adoption support services provided by those who have an appropriate level of training and expertise.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para17"></a>In the light of what I have said, I hope the noble Baroness will agree that informal providers of adoption support services, such as the support groups held in people's own homes, will not be classed as adoption support agencies and will not be required to register as such. The last thing the Government would want to do would be to prevent people affected by adoption from supporting each other on an informal basis. We want to encourage this. However, the intention behind the new provisions is to ensure that adoption support services&#151;such as counselling&#151;are provided to a high standard by people with the necessary qualifications, training and expertise to meet adoption-related needs. I hope that that meets the point the noble Baroness has raised.

I want to make it clear that "voluntary" does not always mean "amateur". I wanted to draw a distinction between <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-20_para22"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to move Amendment No. 30. This is a straightforward and familiar amendment, making the regulation-making powers under Clause 9 subject to the affirmative procedure.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para23"></a>Clause 9 is statutory cover for regulations made under several clauses of the Bill. Those regulation-making powers, taken together, are extremely broad in their scope and will cover many important matters which ought to be debated properly in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para24"></a>Regulation-making powers are particularly important because, under Clause 9(3), the regulations may provide for penalties for contravention or failure to comply with the regulations, with the possibility of a fine up to level five&#151;£5,000 in current money. The Secretary of State will decide in the regulations which of them attracts the possibility of a fine.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para25"></a>The Government have said very little about the regulations generally under this clause and, so far as I am aware, nothing about the kind of circumstances they would see as appropriate for penalties to be applied. I hope the Minister will say a little more today about the areas where penalties are considered appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para26"></a>Perhaps I may remind the Committee about the scope of the regulations that could be made under Clause 9. Clause 10 covers a whole range of issues connected with the management of the agencies. Clause 11, importantly, covers fees to be charged. Clause 12 covers the very important area of the independent review of determinations. Clause 44 is a potentially controversial clause on the suitability of adopters. Clauses 53, 55 and 64 cover various aspects of information collection and provision. All of these are extremely important areas and I know that Members of the Committee will be discussing aspects of them as we progress through the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para27"></a>I will not spend a great deal of time today listing the particular questions that we would want answered. I hope the Minister will say a little more about making progress on drafting regulations under this area. I understand that the document published last week covers the areas included in Clause 4, but not the wide range of areas to which I have just referred which would come within the regulation-making power in Clause 9. I hope that the Minister will say what consultation will be undertaken, when he expects the draft to be published and so on. It may well be that, in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the light of what he says we will need to revisit the regulation-making powers in some more detailed and targeted way on Report.
<P>

<a name="20627-20_para28"></a>At present, we are simply being asked to agree that a massive amount of detail will be left to subordinate legislation, subject only to the negative procedure. I am well aware&#151;and I am sure the Minister will remind me&#151;that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has given a green light to these powers. Nevertheless, it is proper for the Committee to reflect on whether these massive regulation-making powers, especially connected with the issue of penalties, ought to indicate that the stronger affirmative procedure should be used in this case. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   As reluctant as I am to break my Trappist approach to the Bill, I thought I had better rise to speak to Amendment No. 49.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para0"></a>Curiosity partly drives the amendment, which is to Clause 14. The grouping is slightly strange. The only common factor in Amendments Nos. 30 and 49 is the word "regulation". Be that as it may, it is an opportunity to talk about the considerable number of regulations under the Bill, how they can be enforced, and the mechanism for enforcing them under Clause 14.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para1"></a>A major question arises as to why enforcement depends so entirely on the Minister's decision under Clause 14. A memorandum from the Department of Health submitted to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee which tried to explain why it is done by way of ministerial direction&#151;this is how the regulations and the duties under the Bill will be enforced, rather than by penalties of any kind, whether they are fines, imprisonment, or other forms of sanction&#151;stated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The powers in Clause 14 will only be used in exceptional circumstances and will need to be used on a reactive basis where speed will be important. The Department, therefore, considers that as under Section 7(d) of the 1970 Act"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-21_para2"></a>
and I confess I have not gone back to the 1970 Act,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is appropriate for them to take the form of order and direction-making powers rather than for them to be set out in primary legislation or regulations. This would give the appropriate Minister maximum flexibility as to their use".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-21_para3"></a><P>

<a name="20627-21_para4"></a>I am used to circular arguments, but that is a classic circular argument. It is required because it is required and it is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para5"></a>The Minister could do rather better than that, and I know he normally does, in explaining these things. Why should there not be a more general power of enforcement at the behest of the general public or public authorities? We have only the enforcement of the duties under the Bill, which are considerable. We have discussed only half of them so perhaps we are putting the cart before the horse in talking about sanctions before we have gone through the full range <P>


<a name="column_CWH100"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of regulations. It seems rather curious that there is nothing that an individual, adoption agency or public authority can enforce under the Bill under Clause 14. Why should there not be sanctions that bite? There is only the declaration of default by the Minister. That is entirely within the Minister's discretion.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para6"></a>These are serious duties under the Bill, serious regulations to be taken seriously particularly as they concern the welfare of children. There is an extremely good case for having sanctions which have real teeth, and that is why, in Amendment No. 49, we have suggested fines or imprisonment. That would be in addition to the direction-making power of the Minister, not as an alternative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I turn first to Amendment No. 30. My arguments have not changed very much since we debated this matter some 10 minutes ago. We believe that in following what is the general principle in relation to legislation in the social services field, we have used the negative power in terms of regulations in general, although there are three clauses in this Bill where the affirmative power is used. However, two of those are Henry VIII clauses and one is a very wide ranging power indeed.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para7"></a>As the noble Baroness has suggested, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee believes that we have that right. I can assure Members of the Committee that in all these regulations we intend to take a fully inclusive approach towards consultation which will then lead to draft regulations. We will do that in the case of all regulations and we wish to have a fully inclusive approach.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para8"></a>As far as Amendment No. 49 is concerned, I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Clement Jones, has decided to venture into our debates today&#151;he has been much missed! Clause 14 provides default powers for the appropriate Minister which are exercisable where a local authority has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with any of its duties imposed by the Bill or by Sections 1 or 2(4) of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999. Amendment No. 49 seeks to insert a new subsection into Clause 14 to enable regulations to prescribe that the contravention of any provision of the adoption regulations may be a criminal offence punishable by a maximum level five fine or three months' custody.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para9"></a>Regulations which will set out how adoption agencies and adoption support agencies are to exercise their function will be made under Clause 9. Clause 9(3) provides that regulations may provide that anyone who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of regulations made under Clause 9 will be guilty of an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding level five, which is currently set at £5,000. A new subsection to Clause 14, to provide penalties for breaching adoption regulations is, therefore, unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para10"></a>However, Amendment No. 49 also provides for the possibility of a custodial sentence of up to three months for a breach of regulations. We do not believe <P>


<a name="column_CWH101"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that this is appropriate because again, regulations under Clause 9 will make provision for any purpose relating to the exercise by local authorities or voluntary adoption agencies of their functions in relation to adoption. They will also make provision for any purpose relating to the exercise by adoption support agencies of their functions in relation to adoption support services. Local authorities, voluntary adoption agencies and adoption support agencies will all be subject to regular inspection by the National Care Standards Commission.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para11"></a>If a local authority fails to perform those functions adequately, the appropriate Minister may then use the default powers under Clause 14. Of course, that is the point which was made so eloquently in the department's memorandum, to which the noble Lord referred, and the argument there is very compelling indeed. The point is that you might need to take action very quickly, which is where the Minister's default powers would need to be made. However, that has to be looked at alongside the context of Clause 9(3) where we have further regulation-making power in that aspect.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para12"></a>There are, thus, a number of ways in which action can be taken, including the regulatory power of the National Care Standards Commission itself, which will be taking over in this area from April 2003. I hope that that has been of some clarification to the noble Lord and that he will see fit to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I shall, if I may, interrogate the Minister a little further. I do not think he expected to get away quite as lightly as that. The reference he mentioned&#151;Clause 9(3)&#151;does indeed talk about "an offence" and "subject to summary conviction" and so forth without the imprisonment sanction, but that is only in respect of regulations made under Clause 9. The amendment seeks a much wider sanction in respect of all duties under the Bill and, indeed, the Minister's direction-making powers also cover the full range of duties in the Bill as well.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para13"></a>Therefore, the Minister has partially answered the question as regards the regulations under Clause 9, but there are other regulations and duties under the Bill that require a similar sanction. Since there is already the sanction of a fine, if not imprisonment, does the Minister agree that Clause 9(3) sanctions should sweep up other regulations under the Bill?
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   As far as my reading is concerned, we know that Clause 9 relates to the general power to regulate adoption agencies. It is clear that what is encompassed in the clause is the exercise by local authorities or voluntary adoption agencies of their functions in relation to adoption or the exercise by adoption support agencies of their functions in relation to adoption support services. That is a very wide description of the action that can be taken under subsection (3).

<a name="20627-21_para14"></a>I am not persuaded that with the provisions of the Bill, particularly with the default provision in Clause 14, we do not have enough tools at our disposal to ensure that the Bill is properly regulated and that proceedings can be taken against people who do not act appropriately. However, I am obviously happy to consider any further comments the noble Lord has to make on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Will the noble Lord say whether Clause 9(3) applies to regulations made for the purposes of Clause 4 relating to the assessments which we were discussing earlier?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My understanding is that the work of the local authority in ensuring that adoption support services are adequate and effective is, and can be seen to be, part of its general responsibilities in relation to adoption, so I think that the answer is "yes".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   The Minister may want to write afterwards, because "under this section" means subsection (3). I do not want to push the Minister into a corner, but subsection (3) deals only with the issues in Clause 9.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I shall look at this and write further, but subsection (1) makes it clear that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations may make provision for any purpose relating to ... the exercise by local authorities or voluntary adoption agencies of their functions in relation to adoption".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="20627-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I do not want to continue this ad nauseam because non-lawyers will perhaps find it extremely dull, although accountants, or, indeed, actuaries, might find it very exciting. Those would be regulations made under Clause 9. They refer specifically to regulations made "under this section" and therefore they would be Clause 9(1) regulations as opposed to Clause 4(6) regulations, for instance, which would be a separate set of regulations. I suppose that one might say that they are made under both sections. There might be some fancy footwork that could be adopted, but I suspect that it would be quite difficult to provide for the sanctions of all regulations under the Bill. In fact, I am sure that it would be very difficult to provide for all regulations under the Bill by having the sanctions set out in Clause 9(3). That is my point. It should be possible under the Bill for others&#151;not just the Minister&#151;to have the power of sanctions. In turn, those sanctions should be more powerful than simply the power of direction. In a sense, that is an administrative matter; it is not really a genuine sanction against someone who has failed to carry out a very important duty under these regulations.
<P>

<a name="20627-21_para15"></a>If one were to put that in parallel with the Care Standards Act, which we debated at some length, one would see that they are not on all fours, basically, whereas under the Care Standards Act one would find such penalties where regulations had been <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, on that point. We await some clarification from the Minister.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para0"></a>Could the Minister respond to two questions that I posed? Can the noble Lord give any indication of the kind of areas where penalties are likely to be applied? Can he also say something about when the regulation-making process will begin and end?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I cannot give an exact date regarding when the regulations will be available in draft form, but I shall certainly see whether I can find out when this is likely to be.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para1"></a>To give the noble Baroness some idea about this, I should explain that Clause 9(3) mirrors the position under the Care Standards Act. For example, regulations may provide that failure by a local authority, a voluntary adoption agency, or an adoption support agency to comply with regulations relating to the exercise of their functions, may be a criminal offence. There are examples in the children's homes regulations and the fostering agency regulations, where a breach of regulations by a local authority made under the Care Standards Act will be a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para2"></a>Under the children's homes regulations of 2001, it is an offence to contravene or fail to comply with regulations that cover, for example, the requirement to compile a statement of purpose, or the requirement to appoint a manager. The offence applies equally to local authorities and to independent children's homes.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para3"></a>One might also look at the Fostering Services Regulations 2002, which deal with contravention or failure to comply with a number of regulations, including those relating to producing and reviewing a statement of purpose, as well as arrangements for the protection of children and the staffing of the fostering services. Failure to comply with those regulations, or contravention of those regulations, would render a local authority liable to prosecution. I hope that that gives a flavour of what regulations might provide for. We clearly need to do more work on that before we are in a position to consult.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that information. We have had an interesting discussion on this area of the Bill, but it leaves me with a degree of unease that there is so little worked out in the Government's position. We are referred to the kind of regulations that have been made under previous legislation, and somehow we deduce that this represents the Government's current intention in relation to the kinds of regulations that might be made under this Bill. Clearly there is no purpose in pursuing that in detail today. We shall reflect on what has been said when we read the report of this debate in Hansard. We may well want to return to this area, given both the wide-ranging regulation-making powers but, more <P>

"( ) as to keeping records."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-22_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a very simple amendment, which seeks to amend the end of Clause 10 by proposing that regulations should be made, "as to keeping records".
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para9"></a>There is a phrase under Clause 10(1)(f) that provides that regulations may make provision as to "the keeping of information". I am not quite sure what that means. Most people would think that a "record" is a little different from "information". It is something which is formally done in order to explain to everyone what one's work has been and how it has been carried out. In bodies that are regulated through statute, those records very often have to be kept in an approved form.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para10"></a>We have tabled the amendment to find out how seriously the Government, in proposing these regulations, take the matter of keeping records. I do not need to repeat the arguments that I made at an earlier stage, because this amendment really falls in the same group. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   As I have said, I agree that proper records need to be kept. We will certainly ensure that that happens. As far as concerns the definition of "the keeping of information", I should explain that Clause 139, which provides general interpretation, defines "information" as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"information recorded in any form".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-22_para11"></a>
My interpretation of that is that the regulation-making power in subsection (1)(f) already enables regulations to be made, as it describes how voluntary adoption agencies and adoption support agencies must keep their records.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para12"></a>The word "information" is used because of developments in information technology; for example, the term "record" may not include information sent via e-mail, whereas the term "information" does. Later on, during the passage of the Bill, I know that we will return to the debates that we had on the tobacco Bill on this fascinating issue.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para13"></a>I hope that I have assured the noble Baroness that the wording does meet her requirements.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B>   moved Amendment No. 32:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 10, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-22_para16"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "PROVISION OF INFORMATION AFTER DEATH OF AN ADOPTED PERSON
<br>
 In relation to local authorities, voluntary adoption agencies and adoption support agencies, regulations under section 9 may provide that, where those bodies become aware of the death of an adopted person, they may give information to the natural parents of that adopted person."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-22_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 32. The subject of the notification to a natural parent of an adopted child is a complex one. When a child is given up for adoption, we appreciate that the vast majority of natural parents never forget the pain and trauma of giving up that child. It is, though, in the interests of the child that the subsequent adoptive family is given primacy, in order to provide a stable, loving family in which he is able to feel that he belongs. Some adopted children do not wish to seek out their natural parents, as they find their adoptive family to be sufficient emotionally. Conversely, some natural parents will find it easier, or indeed, less painful, to put this event behind them.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para18"></a>Previously, a natural parent had very limited rights to contact a child after having given him up for adoption. However, if an adoptee dies, there must be a presumption that it is right to tell a natural parent of his death. Indeed, this may help to bring some closure to the trauma that is felt by a natural parent at having given up a child.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para19"></a>The amendment before the Committee seeks to balance these complex issues in a measured manner&#151;it imposes a responsibility, not an outright duty. It allows for a natural parent to be told of the death of an adoptee in order to allow for that emotional closure of which I spoke earlier. The intention is not to add unnecessarily to the emotional burdens felt by both natural and adoptive parents.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para20"></a>In the Special Standing Committee in the other place, the Minister said that the Government were prepared to re-consider the matter and would consult adoption stakeholders about an appropriate way forward. Our amendment seeks to flush the Government out on this. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Our National Adoption Standards say that where adoptive parents have agreed to inform the agency of the death of the adopted child, the birth parents or the next of kin should, if they wish, be informed by the adoption agency of the adopted person's death.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para21"></a>I think that we all recognise that these matters need to be handled in the most sensitive way possible. While the Bill was before the Commons Standing Committee, an amendment was tabled that would have placed on the face of the Bill a duty for the adoption agency, where it became aware that the adopted person had died, to make reasonable efforts to inform the birth parents of his death. The Government considered that, rather than placing such a duty in the Bill, it would be better to place such a requirement on adoption agencies through regulations under the powers in Clause 9. This would provide the <P>


<a name="column_CWH106"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>flexibility needed to prescribe, after due consultation with adoption stakeholders, the way in which adoption agencies should carry out this sensitive duty.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para22"></a>We would, for example, be able to prescribe the manner in which this information is received from the adoptive family and passed to the birth family; to prescribe the type of information, such as cause of death and place of burial; and the way in which adopters' views may be considered, given that this information could identify them. Above all, we would want to ensure that this sensitive information is handled and passed on with care and consideration for the feelings of all concerned. As the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said, my colleague Mrs Jacqui Smith gave a commitment at Commons Committee stage that we would consider providing for this under Clause 9 and that we would consider and consult with adoption stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="20627-22_para23"></a>I cannot add much more to that at this stage. I have set out some of the issues and parameters on which we shall consult. Of course, we also have the ability in Clause 9 to make appropriate regulation-making powers.

"( ) Regulations under section 9 may prescribe the requirement for adoption agencies and local authorities to publish their fees."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20627-23_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are nearing the end of a Sitting in which we have gone over and over the vexed question of regulations. I am starting to ask myself at what point regulations should take over. In the previous debate, I was struck by the fact that nothing that the Minister said contravened the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, who was trying to make a point of principle. That is what I am trying to do in Amendment No. 33: I am not in any way trying to limit the flexibility of the department or of the agencies, but to establish in the Bill a point of principle.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para2"></a>The principle is that when fees and charges are levied, they should be published. As we know, fees vary not only in relation to intercountry adoption but in domestic adoption. People go into the process of adoption for a variety of reasons, but I rather think that monetary issues are not at the top of their agenda. Similarly, as this is such an emotional subject, and harking back to an earlier discussion, I do not believe that money is a great incentive to break any of the laws or regulations.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH107"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para3"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, very early in the process, people know where they stand. I am absolutely sure that the Minister will come back and say that the way in which fees work is a matter for regulation, as indeed it is, but I believe that we have reached a point of principle. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The amendment would highlight that regulations may require that local authorities publish their fees.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para4"></a>On the whole, the fees charged by adoption agencies to both adopters and prospective adopters and to other adoption agencies are already in the public domain. In respect of fees charged between adoption agencies, the level of the interagency fee is announced annually by the Consortium of Voluntary Adoption Agencies. This is agreed between voluntary adoption agencies themselves. The intercountry adoption guide issued by the Department of Health makes it clear that all adoption agencies charging fees to adopters and prospective adopters should clearly state what the fee will be prior to the start of the process. Agencies are also encouraged to provide applicants with a written statement detailing what is included in the fee. It is a clear legal requirement, both in current legislation and in Clauses 93 and 94 of the Bill, that adoption agencies may not derive a profit from this or any other work. The powers in Clause 9 are therefore sufficiently flexible to enable the appropriate minister to require adoption agencies, through regulations, to publish their fees or to make them known to prospective adopters at the start of the assessment process.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para5"></a>The Government's current position is that we think the system as currently set up works well. However, we would be willing to consider whether it might be necessary to go down the regulatory route if we received evidence to the contrary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I thank the Minister very much for that reply. However, very strong representations have made it clear that the current system does not work well in relation to intercountry adoption, where there are such huge variations between different agencies. The problem is not so great in respect of domestic adoptions, but I wonder whether that will continue to be the case when this Bill and its many provisions hit what has already been well described as the "financially restrained world" of local authorities as we know them. The point will be amplified particularly when assessment becomes a reality.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para6"></a>Although this may seem a small issue, I believe that it may be larger than we suspect. At this stage in our proceedings, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: We come now to an extremely important part of the Bill. On Second Reading, very many noble Lords made powerful points in relation to Clause 12 and the whole issue of the independent review of determinations. Three areas were the subject of concern on all sides of the House: the strength of the duty to establish the procedure; the level of independence under the clause as it stands; and the whole issue of the breadth of the role of the independent review or independent determination, and precisely what steps that covers.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para12"></a>It is in that context that I move Amendment No. 34, speak to Amendments Nos. 38, 39, 40, 42, 43 and 44, and, I suspect, in the absence of the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, speak to Amendment No. 37. The words used by my noble friend Lady Barker on Clause 4 are equally apposite here. I thought she was being remarkably moderate when she said that there was something incomplete about Clause 4, but there is certainly something incomplete about Clause 12.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para13"></a>Historically, children and families have found it almost impossible to have had decisions made about their lives and families reviewed in this context and, if appropriate, overturned. There has been widespread recognition of the need for change and for the institution of a proper system of review. Sir William Utting, in his 1997 report, People Like Us, was crucial in moving the opinion of those in the sector in the right direction.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para14"></a>Indeed, the reasoning of the Secretary of State during Second Reading of the Bill in the other place was:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is right to build in independent review throughout the system"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-23_para15"></a>
that seems to be of fundamental importance&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whether of the provision of information to adopted children about their birth families, or of decisions to place a child with a particular family . . . The issues are difficult and emotionally fraught".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 29/10/01; col. 659.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-23_para16"></a>
Those are strong words, which we very much support.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para17"></a>In the recent Appeal Court judgment in S & W & Others, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The view, widespread among family judges, is that all too often local authorities' discharge of their parental responsibilities falls short of an acceptable standard".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-23_para18"></a>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, followed that up by suggesting a way forward through independent review. That is a very good background against which to judge whether Clause 12 stands up.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para19"></a>Sir William Utting, in the same 1997 report, made the case by identifying the need for "shifts in three cultures" and that is where the issue of independence is so vital. That is the test that we need to apply to see whether this clause really will deliver the goods in terms of what he said in that report. The three cultures he was talking about were, first, the directors, trustees and councillors who for reasons of money, prestige or politics find good reason for keeping quiet. Secondly, there were the salaried managers, for whom the <P>


<a name="column_CWH109"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>failures of subordinates may be represented as an indictment of their own performance and, thirdly, the staff themselves.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para20"></a>Without re-treading all of that, that is what a proper review system has to face. It has to take a dispassionate look at the situation and be independent.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para21"></a>The all-party parliamentary group on adoption called for comprehensive and independent appeals as a result. It is well-known that almost every adoption body in the field&#151;judges, lawyers and so on, apart from the ones I have already quoted&#151;have called for that sort of system.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para22"></a>Under the existing clause, there is provision for prospective adopters who were turned down by adoption panels to appeal against a qualifying determination. It was Jacqui Smith in the other place who made the point that that, essentially, was an appeal to an adoption panel of a neighbouring authority. I am far from convinced, and this is one of the reasons for some of the amendments, as to whether that is satisfactory. That is not satisfactory either in terms of compliance with the Human Rights Act or indeed of common sense, when you think that there will be quite a degree of sympathy between neighbouring authorities in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para23"></a>The issue of cost is also a matter of considerable concern. In Clause 3(a), where the power to recover the costs of the review from the adoption agency exists, that will inevitably also be a deterrent in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para24"></a>Moving on to the whole issue raised by Amendment No. 37 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson, the width of this clause is inadequate&#151;it does not cover the whole range of determinations that it should. It does not cover the question of a child being moved on to another set of foster carers, or the question of a fosterer whose foster child is moved on for no apparent reason, or approved adopters denied a match with a child they wished to adopt, even if there is no other applicant for that child. It does not cover adoptive families who are turned down in their assessment for post-adoption support, the question of approved couples who are never matched with a child and intercountry adopters applying for home studies being put to the bottom of their local authorities' assessment list.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para25"></a>Those are just examples of instances during the process which would not be covered by Clause 12 under the review system. That would be deeply unsatisfactory. That is why it is important that significant decisions should be covered by that review. The amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, are very elegant in the way they are set out and they are set out in rather more detail, but they may constitute a list in the Minister's view and we have had those debates before. The Minister may take his choice of amendments and I am sure will approve of one of them.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para26"></a>Moving on to the question of duty, I do not want to have the traditional may/shall debate, which essentially is constituted by Amendment No. 34 but should be rather more robustly set out in terms of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH110"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nature of the independent review system. For that reason, we have set down that there should be established such a review and it should not be a question of whether or not regulations under Clause 9 do that in the first place. We do not consider that an optional extra but an absolutely vital component in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20627-23_para27"></a>That is pretty much it, except for the issue of intercountry adoption, which is of great concern and importance because there are circumstances where review of determinations made by a central authority or home health departments in respect of intercountry adoption applications needs to be made. I will not go through all the circumstances in which that can be made, given the hour of the day, but significant determination if made by the central authority or the home health department must be transparent and should be open to independent review. Currently, central authority and home health department decisions can be challenged only through judicial review and, even where prospective adopters are in a position to finance this course, it is a slow process which does not sit easily within the intercountry adoption process nor meets the needs of children for whom delay is almost always detrimental. That, in particular, is an important element of Amendment No. 38, which deals with independent adoption. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-24_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   These amendments are about two things; fairness and public confidence. The two are closely linked, of course. The systems that we put in place for the adoption of children have to be fair and to be seen to be fair. I say that because without transparent fairness, the system will not command confidence. Good people who would otherwise put themselves forward as potential adopters will be deterred from doing so. The four amendments in my name that are included in this group, Amendments Nos. 35, 36, 41 and 45, all rest on that premise.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para0"></a>Clause 12, I say immediately, is very welcome. It is critically important that people who apply to become adopters and are then turned down, for whatever reason, should be able to appeal against that decision. The appeal mechanism needs to be as simple as possible and must of course be impartial. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us something of what the Government have in mind for this process. However, there is a whole mass of other decisions that the local authority can take, upon which, apparently, there will be no prospect of an independent review, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones has so eloquently stated.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para1"></a>What happens, for example, when approved adopters are refused a match with a child for whom there are no other potential adopters in sight? What happens to people who want a home study in order to <P>


<a name="column_CWH111"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be able to adopt from abroad, but who are constantly put to the bottom of the list? What happens to foster parents who want to adopt the child they are looking after, but who encounter an intransigent policy decision by the local authority not to allow them to do so&#151;because there are local authorities like that? As the Bill stands, those people just have to put up with the situation&#151;they have to lump it.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para2"></a>Yes, you can complain, but who will the complaint be handled by? It will be handled by the very local authority against whom the complainant feels aggrieved. For a local authority to find itself guilty of gross misconduct or maladministration would be quite a feat. I am not saying that it could not happen, but a priori it is unlikely.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para3"></a>There is also a question mark over whether the current complaints procedure is sufficiently independent and impartial to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Judicial review is expensive. It is out of reach of most people and in any case we do not want to encourage it. As an alternative you can go to the Ombudsman or to the Social Services Inspectorate, but the remit of both of these is limited and in cases that involve possible maladministration by a voluntary agency, the Ombudsman has no locus.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para4"></a>We have to remember that the system is terribly daunting for children and families. They can feel intimidated by it. They can sometimes feel that they are not being listened to. Of course, I am very much against promoting a culture of complaining. People should not be encouraged to complain about every little thing that goes amiss. We should try to limit the availability of independent review to those matters that have a significant impact on the lives of children or on prospective adopters.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para5"></a>I will not go through my Amendment No. 41 in minute detail. It is largely self-explanatory and I have covered parts of it already. However, if the Committee will forgive me, I will read out a case history that illustrates what I am trying to drive at. This relates to a couple who live in central London. They say this:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We live in a very mixed area racially speaking. Our circle of friends and acquaintances is also mixed. We adopted a 7-year-old white English boy in 1996 and, with many ups and downs, it is now a stable and happy relationship. In 1999, we applied to adopt his mixed-race older half-sister, then 13. We had grown to be very fond of her after regular contact. She had been moved several times in foster care and expressed a desire to live with us. The placement was refused on the grounds that she was of mixed race and we were not. We did our utmost to try to persuade them but nothing was achieved. We still abide by the contact order which we all value but the girl is still in foster-care (she has been in many other placements). We believe the girl, our relationship with the girl and our son's relationship with her&#151;and inevitably our son too&#151;have been ill-served by the LA's refusal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20627-24_para6"></a>
This was a case where the couple would have liked to appeal on several grounds. There were no avenues of appeal open to them and the Bill would not provide any either.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para7"></a>I will speak briefly to my Amendment No. 45. On occasions there will be issues that come before the panel of a technical or legal description where it is <P>


<a name="column_CWH112"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important to have professional legal interpretation. In cases of that kind, applicants to the panel should have a right of appeal to the High Court. If the panel felt that a matter would be more appropriately dealt with by court judgment than by itself, it could, as it were, bow out of the process. Subsection (11) of the amendment ensures that children would have the right to be party to the proceedings unless that right had been expressly waived.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para8"></a>Subsection (14) says that the reasonable costs and expenses of the application to the panel, or any appeal to the High Court, should be paid out of public funds. I have heard quite a lot of concern expressed that the costs of going to a panel or to appeal could impose considerable burdens on private individuals. I am the last person to wish to create cumbersome procedures and I realise that the Committee may fear that what I propose in the amendment is a little cumbersome and over-bureaucratic. However, I do not see it in that way. A proper appeal system need not be bureaucratic. Indeed, it should be seen as essential in my view.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para9"></a>I come back to where I began which is to the issue of fairness. The system has to command confidence, and to do that, it has to be seen to be fair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   I wish to speak briefly to Amendment No. 37. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for saying so much of what I would have said far more eloquently than I would have said it. I wish to add one point. I refer to a comment of Alun Milburn, the Secretary of State for Health, who said that he would be happy to hear views on how the independent review system can be strengthened. In the light of that, I tabled the amendment, which I believe is a strengthening one as regards Clause 12(1). It would both clarify and strengthen it. An independent review must be seen to be truly independent, otherwise it will be suspect from the beginning. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that those on the appeal panel will indeed be truly independent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I would like to support the principle of an independent review panel for the reasons which have been mentioned. I want to add a couple of points. First, when decisions are made about adoption placements, they are necessarily made very much in private because the relevant material is confidential. Therefore, it is always difficult for people to understand how the decisions have been made. They are not subject to any real scrutiny outside that professional milieu.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para10"></a>I refer to the case history that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned. Some local authorities take a particular view of these matters. Again, I speak on behalf of social workers who have to implement decisions even if they do not particularly agree with them. It is extraordinarily difficult for families to understand what debate took place because the relevant documentation is confidential. Therefore, it is extremely important that these decisions are subject to external scrutiny and that there should be transparency. There is also a consumer issue here. The people who are consuming the services we are <P>


<a name="column_CWH113"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussing have the same rights to independent review as any other consumer of services. I refer to the issue of human rights. We have to take that point into account as well.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para11"></a>I was interested in the view of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that local authorities might be friendly towards each other. That is not necessarily my experience. Having said that, it is inappropriate that the same people within the system should undertake a review. I would like to see independent panels. We can all hope that the national standards will iron out some of the issues we are discussing with regard to difficult cases that arise. However, that will not confer the same sort of public confidence as a transparent, independent review system would.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am grateful for the contributions that have been made. In a sense, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, put his finger on the matter when he said that whilst he recognised the importance of having access to an independent review, he also thought that there should be limits. What we do not want is a system whereby those organisations covered by independent review would be subject to micro-management by such a review process.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para12"></a>I well understand that the argument will concern where the balance lies. The Bill as it stands gives regulation-making power to make provision as to description of determinations which are qualifying determinations which gives future flexibility in the light of experience. I believe that is a very sensible and balanced way to go forward.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para13"></a>Amendment No. 35 would require the appropriate Minister, as soon as he exercised his power under Clause 9, to make any regulations in respect of the functions of adoption agencies and adoption support agencies, to establish the independent review mechanism through regulations. Amendment No. 34 has a similar effect in requiring the appropriate Minister to set up an independent review mechanism.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para14"></a>We promised in the White Paper that we would develop the independent review mechanism. We have also said that we will consult stakeholders in the adoption field on how the independent review mechanism should operate and the determinations which should be used to review. We will be starting this process towards the end of the year and there is no question that we will set up such an independent review mechanism.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para15"></a>Moving to Amendment No. 36, the effect of this amendment is twofold. First it would apply the independent review procedure to any determination made by an adoption agency and here we come to the question of balance. Members of the Committee will know that our intent is that the independent review mechanism is established for two specific purposes, and I also accept that part of this whole process and reason for such review mechanism is to build up confidence in the assessment process for prospective adopters. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on the importance of that.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH114"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para16"></a>We have gone beyond the original recommendation by extending the scope of the review mechanism to provide a balance for the adoption agencies' use of discretion in the area of access to protected information held in the records they will be obliged to keep in relation to a person's adoption. I must stress that the review mechanism was never intended as a means of micro-managing the day-to-day business of adoption agencies. Also, in relation to local authority adoption services, adoption is a mainstream social service function. The majority of complaints about local authority adoption services must be best dealt with through the existing social services complaints procedure. The whole point of having a complaints procedure is that complaints are addressed to that process.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para17"></a>I accept there are some Members of the Committee who think that not all local authorities have a very effective complaints procedure, and I share that view. However, the challenge is not to say that we can never, ever achieve a decent complaints procedure; the challenge is to make sure that local authorities do have a complaints procedure, which is why we have the listening-to-people consultation exercise. The answer is not to say that the independent review mechanism can go so wide that almost anything a local authority does under the adoption process is subject to the independent review.
<P>

<a name="20627-24_para18"></a>I really believe that would be a very extensive process of the remit that we had in mind for the independent review mechanism. I do not believe we should allow it to side-track the complaints procedures which are already in place.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-25_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. I wonder whether he could comment on one point. Even if we were to see an improvement across the board of local authority complaint procedures and those procedures worked rather better than they do at the moment, does the Minister think there is a question mark over whether local authority complaints procedures comply with the ECHR in terms of their impartiality and independence?
<P>

<a name="20627-25_time0"></a><H5>7.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Clearly, ECHR considerations are always paramount. If a complaints procedure did not comply with ECHR, that system could be challenged, as could any other decision which is felt not to comply with ECHR. I am not particularly aware of the arguments on that and am certainly prepared to look at it and write to the noble Earl. I would also say to the noble Earl that in any case, what we have here is a flexibility in our approach. If it turns out that there are specific problems which are identified as we continue to monitor the system, we have the flexibility to use the regulation-making power in Clause 12(2) in order to expand on the scope of the independent review mechanism.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para0"></a>However, I would plead with Members of the Committee to allow us to proceed as we wish, to focus upon the two areas that we have identified which we believe to be the most critical and sensitive and to <P>


<a name="column_CWH115"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enhance the complaints mechanism. Then, in the light of experience, we will have the opportunity to review that. However, when you come for instance to Amendment No. 41, where the determinations are listed at paragraphs (a) to (k), you run into all the problems of a list approach and I question whether that is satisfactory. As I have said already, we are in great danger of widening the potential independent review so much that it really does detract from the normal processes of management of these organisations and the ability of people to use the complaints system.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para1"></a>I also accept that in this very large group of amendments, there are a number of issues that relate to the panel and how independent it is. I want to make clear that subsection (4) of Clause 12 enables the appropriate Minister to delegate the operation of the independent review mechanism to an organisation and I would assure Members of the Committee that this will help ensure the independence of the review mechanism. Subsection (8) provides that this organisation may be a public body or a private or voluntary organisation and, under subsection (6), the appropriate Minister may make payments to the organisation running the review mechanism in connection with its operation.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 43 and 44 would make clear that the appropriate Minister may delegate the operation of the independent review mechanism only to an organisation which is independent of the appropriate Minister. That is not necessary. We promised to review the independent review mechanism in our White Paper. I have explained, and it was stated in the White Paper, that the independent review mechanism will be operated by an independent body and we intend to use the powers in subsection (4) of Clause 12 to delegate the operation of the independent review mechanism to an independent body.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para3"></a>Amendment No. 38 seeks to provide for a person in respect of whom the Minister has made a determination to be able to apply to the independent review mechanism for a review of that decision. However, that rather misses the point about the role of Ministers in the intercountry adoption process. Ministers do not make decisions concerning intercountry adoption. The Department of Health and the National Assembly for Wales act as a central authority for intercountry adoptions. That means they check that all the proper procedures and checks have been followed, query any discrepancies in information and then issue a certificate confirming that a competent agency has confirmed the prospective adopters to be eligible and suitable to adopt. Neither Ministers nor the central authorities make a determination which it would be appropriate for the independent review panel to review.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para4"></a>Amendment No. 42, on the power to recover costs, would omit from Clause 12(3)(a) the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"including the power to recover the costs of a review from the adoption agency by which the determination reviewed was made".
<P>

<a name="column_CWH116"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
On this I can say that the cost of establishing and administering the independent review mechanism will be met centrally from the extra £66 million for adoption announced in the adoption White Paper. However, adoption agencies may be required to contribute to meeting the cost of convening a review panel. This cost will be incurred instead of the costs of holding a second hearing of the agency's own panel, as usually occurs under the current legal framework. We therefore do not think that there will be an additional expense. As I said, however, we have promised to consult on the detail of how this will operate, including any charges to be imposed on adoption agencies. This will ensure that we get the detail right. It is not our intention to impose onerous obligations on adoption agencies.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para6"></a>Amendment No. 45, on appeal to the High Court, is based on the assumption that the review panel will make decisions&#151;or refuse to make decisions&#151;on, for example, whether applicants should be approved as adopters. It seeks to provide for additional procedures to be operated by the independent review mechanism. However, this fails to recognise that the purpose of the independent review mechanism is to make recommendations to the adoption agencies, not to over-ride their decisions.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para7"></a>It is our intention that an independent body or organisation, appointed by the appropriate Minister under Clause 12(4), will convene a review panel to re-examine the evidence and make a fresh recommendation to the agency. The adoption agency will then be required by regulations made under Clause 12(3)(e) to consider both its original determination and the recommendation of the review panel before making its final decision.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para8"></a>The ultimate responsibility must rest with the adoption agency. The agency is responsible for the provision of the full range of adoption services and is accountable for the number and quality of adoptive placements made. We believe that it would be inappropriate to remove from the adoption agency the final decision about the suitability of prospective adopters or about the release of protected information held in agency records.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para9"></a>A number of other points have been raised, but I should perhaps pause at this stage and return to the substantive point in this whole argument&#151;the range of determinations under which the independent review panel may operate. There is a balance to be struck here; there is no question about that. I have said that we will focus on the two matters that we have identified. However, we will keep this under review. We also have the flexibility of the regulations to allow us to increase that number should it be necessary. We should also have some faith in the ability of the organisations which will operate the adoption service in future to show that they can come up with decent complaints procedures in which the public can have confidence and which can deal with many of the issues rightfully raised in the many amendments that noble Lords have tabled.

<P>
<A NAME="20627-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   It is a great pity that we are debating this at the end of the parliamentary week. I shall be fairly brisk. The Minister gave a rather wide-ranging reply. Although it was welcome in one sense, it was a strange mixture of assurance, of assertion, and, at the very end, of "take faith". I felt that the final part was probably the least credible part of the reply.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para10"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, put his finger on it not when he dealt with limits but when he spoke about public confidence. The Minister can say, "Take faith in our great new system. I'm sure that it'll all be right on the night", but many of us feel that public confidence will not be achieved or restored without an independent review mechanism with the necessary breadth and independence that these amendments propose. I am quite sure that we shall want to return to this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I apologise for intervening, because I recognise that time is getting on. I wonder if the noble Lord would accept that one needs to have some faith. In fact, I stand by the argument that it is necessary in some parts of what we are attempting to do to have strict regulation. As Members of the Committee know, we have a very effective form of performance management coming into play with the National Care Standards Commission. All that is absolutely right.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para11"></a>We also have the use of the independent review mechanism in specified circumstances. However, as part of the confidence-raising approach, ought we not also to show some confidence in the organisations that will have to work with this at the local level? We must get the balance right. If we are so doubtful about their ability to run this effectively that we have to regulate everything that they do to the nth degree, we will not be showing enough confidence in their ability to do the right job. There is a balance; and I believe that we have got it right.

<A NAME="20627-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   At this stage of the evening, I have the word "balance" written down about three or four times&#151;indeed, whenever the Minister mentions it. It mounts up over the period of his speech.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para12"></a>We have to differ on the question of balance. I do not believe that we have achieved that balance. For my part, I have written down the word "caricature". I believe that the Minister has "caricatured" the amendments in terms of saying that it is "micro-management". It is not micro-management. We have designed the amendments so that they represent significant decisions. The approach of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is slightly different, but they are significant decisions that are being made. They affect <P>


<a name="column_CWH118"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column CWH118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the lives of all those different families in different, and highly significant, ways. This is not a question of micro-management. If there are other ways of characterising those decisions, whether by making them significant or by putting them in a list, then that possibility should be explored.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para13"></a>I turn to the question of limits. When the Minister states that we must have limits, and then merely says that there are two sorts of decisions that are subject to this review process, that is grossly inadequate. We shall, of course, return to that issue at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para14"></a>We are talking about a change of culture. We are being told to take faith, but it is a question of culture, as Sir William Utting and many others, including high court judges of Appeal, and so on, have said in some of the extracts that I quoted earlier. That is why they believe that an independent review process is needed.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para15"></a>The Minister sought to be frightfully reassuring in terms of promising flexibility under the regulations; for example, we will consult, we will look again if necessary, and so on. I should much prefer&#151;and I am sure all those in this field would much prefer&#151;to have some degree of consensus and agreement right from the outset about what this amounts to in terms of the scope of the independent review. If that means setting them out specifically in legislation, I believe that that would be welcome.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para16"></a>The Minister also sought to reassure us in terms of subsection (4). The Minister is clearly determined to defend the wording of Clause 12, and not give away an inch. In many cases where he has given us assurances, the words added&#151;for example, "independent"&#151;would give the assurance on the face of the Bill. That would be welcome all round.
<P>

<a name="20627-25_para17"></a>It is a late hour. I do not wish to detain the Committee. It is a question of public confidence. I do not believe the Minister has got it right. The Minister assures us that ex post facto, there will be flexibility. Let us try to get it right first time, rather than tinkering at a later stage. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20627w01_para0"></a>The Department for International Development is responsible for leading the UK Government's contribution to achievement of the millennium goals. A wide range of actions implemented by DfID and described in the departmental report for 2002 help ensure that the hunger target is met. These include promoting broad economic growth; better education, health and social protection; revitalising agriculture; and working to assure improved governance, peace and democracy. They have produced two key documents, one on the subject of Eliminating Hunger and a consultation paper on the role of agriculture in poverty reduction. The development community has recognised these as important contributions to the policy debate. The department worked to influence the negotiation of the World Food Summit declaration in line with this analysis and will be following through at WSSD.
<P>

<a name="20627w01_para1"></a>But progress towards the hunger targets is too slow. In many countries the number of hungry people in increasing. The international community urgently needs to reconsider its approaches and policies to tackle hunger if we are to meet the global hunger target. We attach importance to the role of trade liberalisation in helping to achieve food security for all. Tackling hunger will require significant progress in the opening up of access to agricultural markets, particularly by developed countries. We want to see substantial cuts by developed countries in agricultural support that distorts trade. We are pushing for large reductions in all forms of export subsidies and the untying of food aid from agricultural surpluses in developed countries. And we are helping to build capacity in developing countries to negotiate and engage with international processes such as the Doha Development Round.

<A NAME="20627w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The United Kingdom was one of the first countries to sign the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) Protocol on the trafficking of human beings and is fully committed to implementing its measures.
<P>

<a name="20627w01_para6"></a>We set out in the White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain that we are committed to offering the victims of trafficking particular support so that they can escape their circumstances and, in certain cases, help law enforcement against organised criminals. Where they are willing to come forward to the authorities we shall make special arrangements for their protection. We will also consider whether it would be appropriate to allow them to remain here.
<P>

<a name="20627w01_para7"></a>Where they are to return home, we will assist them to do so, providing them with initial counselling, ensuring that they have suitable accommodation to return to and providing help to enable them to reintegrate into their own community and find employment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Arrangements already exist which enable the police to ask for someone subject to immigration control to be allowed to enter or remain in the United Kingdom where this would assist in the investigation of organised crime. These arrangements would permit a period of reflection but they are not offered automatically.
<P>

<a name="20627w01_para9"></a>The United Kingdom view is that these arrangements are best considered on a case-by-case basis and that a blanket category of treatment is not the way forward. Any blanket grant is open to abuse and may create a perverse incentive for traffickers to exploit more victims by suggesting that they will be granted automatic reflection delays if they are trafficked.

<P>
<A NAME="20627w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   At present it takes too long to extradite someone from the United Kingdom.

<P>

<a name="20627w01_para11"></a>The previous Home Secretary launched a review of extradition law and the Home Office published proposals for consultation in March last year. Since then the attacks on 11 September have added impetus to European Union (EU) plans for an EU-wide arrest warrant.

<a name="20627w03_para4"></a>This review has resulted in the identification of 33 more water bodies in England as sensitive areas: 32 are because the waters have since the last review in 1997 been found to be eutrophic or may in the near future become eutrophic if protective action is not taken. Eutrophic waters are those which are, or may be, adversely (in terms of their ecology and quality) affected by discharges from sewage treatment works serving communities of more than 10,000 inhabitants.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para5"></a>The remaining water body, the River Itchen in the Midlands, which supplies drinking water, has been identified on the basis of elevated levels of nitrate under the terms of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para6"></a>Identification of these areas will result in more stringent treatment being provided at 53 qualifying treatment works by water companies. This treatment involves reducing levels of phosphorus and/or nitrogen in discharges to tackle eutrophication and nitrate levels of these waters.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para7"></a>These new requirements on water companies to remove these nutrients from sewage treatment work discharges will complement and add to the action required by farmers under the Nitrates Directive and by my department on diffuse pollution, which I also announced today.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para8"></a>Lists of the new sensitive areas have today been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses. Maps showing the location of all current sensitive areas (eutrophic) and (nitrate) will be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses and at offices of the Environment Agency in due course.

<P>
<A NAME="20627w03_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Gregson </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What action is being taken to address diffuse pollution of water by agriculture; and how they intend to implement the Nitrates Directive in England in the light of consultation. [HL4954]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20627w03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   One year after the creation of Defra, it gives us enormous pleasure that what were different departments are now working well together to develop an integrated approach to the problems of pollution, and especially diffuse pollution from agriculture.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para9"></a>The increased intensification of farm production and the great steps made to reduce point source pollution from factories and sewage works mean that, as the Policy Commission on Food and Farming noted, agriculture is now clearly one of the major contributors to the pollution of water. It is also a significant polluter of air.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para10"></a>Over time we will need to take further steps to reduce pollution from agriculture but in a cost-effective way. We therefore need to involve farmers very closely in continuing work to achieve a cleaner and healthier environment. Many farmers are committed to protecting and enhancing the environment, but much more needs to be done to raise standards across all farms to the standards of the best and to tackle the specific problem of diffuse pollution.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para11"></a>Over the next few years we will be implementing the EU directives we have signed up to in order to improve water quality. As part of this work, later this year we will be holding a more detailed consultation with all sectors to follow up our first general consultation on implementing the Water Framework Directive.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para12"></a>Over 70 per cent of nitrates and over 40 per cent of phosphates in English waters originate from agricultural land. Up to a half of England's bathing waters are affected by short-term contamination by agricultural pollution, mainly by microbes from livestock manure being washed off farm land after rain. Excessive loads of fine silt are generated by soil erosion from intensively farmed land. Pesticides are contaminating drinking water sources, requiring expensive additional treatment at water works to remove pesticides before water can be supplied to consumers.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para13"></a>No one farmer is responsible for this, but cumulatively diffuse pollution from farms is having a substantial impact on the quality of English waters. That is why we have begun a strategic review of diffuse water pollution from agriculture to identify cost-effective policy measures to prevent and control this pollution and to improve the sustainability of agriculture. We are co-ordinating this review with work announced in the Budget to review the particular role that economic instruments could play in tackling such pollution.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para14"></a>As part of the open approach to policy development that we are seeking to adopt in the new department, I am publishing today a discussion document The Government's Strategic Review of Diffuse Water <P>


<a name="column_WA158"></a>

<B>27 Jun 2002 : Column WA158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Pollution From Agriculture in England, so that we can start a debate with farmers and other stakeholders about the problems that we face and how we can best solve them. This marks the beginning of a process for working with stakeholders to develop a package of policy measures to reduce pollution.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para15"></a>Part of what we need to achieve is improved control of the application of manures and fertilisers to land. Through the review we are considering the full range of policy mechanisms that could play a part in the future in encouraging and assisting farmers to improve their management of manure and nutrients. But we also have to implement some measures now, to comply with the European Court of Justice judgment that we have failed to meet our obligations under the 1991 Nitrates Directive to tackle agricultural nitrate pollution of waters.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para16"></a>We published proposals for implementing the directive in December 2001. We have carefully considered the responses to the consultation and are today publishing an analysis of these responses. We have decided to apply the minimum regulation consistent with our obligations under the directive, to avoid closing off other options for tackling the wider problem of diffuse pollution that might be identified through the current review.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para17"></a>We will designate new nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) covering 47 per cent of the land area of England, which will take the total designated area in England to 55 per cent. These are areas draining into rivers, ground water and other waters which are affected by nitrate pollution. In consequence, farmers using manufactured nitrogen fertilisers or organic manures will be required to follow an action programme to reduce pollution.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para18"></a>This action will help to prevent and reverse damaging impacts of eutrophication, and improve the quality of drinking water sources. Better control of manure spreading will also cut microbiological inputs to water, helping to maintain and further increase the quality of bathing waters and shellfish waters.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para19"></a>The overall extent of the new designations will be less than was originally estimated in the consultation document, as a result of work to define and quantify the NVZ areas more accurately than was possible at the time the consultation document was issued. Some new areas have been added, as was anticipated in the consultation document; but more areas have been removed.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para20"></a>We are today publishing a revised regulatory impact assessment, which estimates that the compliance costs incurred by farmers will amount to about &#163;20 million per year. Costs will vary considerably from farm to farm, but we acknowledge that some farmers, particularly those who need to construct additional slurry storage facilities, will incur substantial costs. To assist those farmers who are most affected, we will extend the existing Farm Waste Grant Scheme to the new NVZ areas to help finance improvements to slurry storage facilities required to implement the action programme.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20627w03_para21"></a>Formal designations setting down the precise boundaries of the new zones will follow as soon as possible, and it will become a legal requirement to follow the action programme from 19 December 2002. By the end of July, Defra will make available detailed interactive maps of the new NVZ areas. As soon as these are available, we will write to farmers to explain how to access these maps. We will also send all farmers in affected areas explanatory guidance material, together with sources of further advice on how to comply with the measures and details on the availability of grant under the Farm Waste Grant Scheme.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para22"></a>We are also taking action to reduce phosphate and nitrate pollution of waters from other sources and are announcing separately additional designations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive that will require water companies to reduce phosphate or nitrate discharges from certain sewage treatment works.
<P>

<a name="20627w03_para23"></a>We are also committed to improving air quality. Eighty five per cent of the ammonia which enters the atmosphere in the UK comes from fertilisers and manures used in agriculture. We will be publishing a booklet later this summer which will explain the problems caused by ammonia emissions to initiate debate on how to tackle this related problem.

<a name="20627w03_para24"></a>This all adds up to a substantial agenda for change. I recognise that we must secure these changes in ways which maximise the beneficial impact on the environment while minimising the regulatory burden on farmers. As we said in Working Together, we need to explore joined-up ways of working; to develop whole farm approaches; and to identify smarter ways of regulating. For example, several of the measures I have mentioned could affect the ways farmers handle manures and fertilisers, pointing to the benefits of more integrated approaches.
